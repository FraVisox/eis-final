                    "bodyText": "Happy hump day! Former Australian prime minister Paul Keating was taking no prisoners today, blasting the Aukus submarine deal as “the worst international decision” taken by a Labor government in a century. “Look, I’d say for the cost – $360bn – for $360bn, we’re going to get eight submarines. It must be the worst deal in all history,” he said in a blistering appearance at the National Press Club where he insulted journalists and chided his Labor colleagues for “essentially [accommodating] the strategic wishes of the United States, uncritically”. In a stinging rebuke of the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, Keating said she had allowed the military to overtake foreign policy in determining the China relationship. “Running around the Pacific islands with a lei around your neck handing out money, which is what Penny does, is not foreign policy. It’s a consular task,” he said. “The Albanese government does not employ foreign policy.” He added that China posed no threat to Australia and that aligning with the British, after the UK had abandoned Australia’s defence in the 20th century, was “deeply pathetic”. Read the full wrap of Keating’s comments by our chief political correspondent, Paul Karp, or watch a two-minute clip of his remarks. Top news Malaysia warning on Aukus | Malaysia has urged Australia, the UK and the US to refrain “from any provocation that could trigger an arms race or affect peace and security in the region”, in a statement issued in response to the Aukus deal. Meanwhile, South Australia, where the nuclear-powered submarines will be built, has pushed back on nuclear waste being left in the state. As part of the Aukus deal, Australia is responsible for any nuclear waste generated by the submarines. Power bills to surge | Electricity bills for households in three states will rise as much as 23.7% from 1 July if the Australian Energy Regulator’s draft determination is confirmed. Prices in Victoria may rise by almost a third. The Coalition jumped on the news, accusing the Albanese government of breaking its election promise to lower power bills. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, was quick to point out that the rises would be higher were it not for the government’s price caps introduced at the end of last year, and that direct relief would come in the May budget. Queensland is already a step ahead, announcing today a rebate to come in the next financial year. ‘Violet’ Coco’s sentence quashed | The NSW district court has overturned a 15-month jail sentence imposed on the climate protester who blocked one lane on the Sydney Harbour Bridge with a truck in April 2022. The original sentencing last December drew attention to the state’s harsh anti-protest laws, including condemnation from the UN. Catholic church abuse | The church is hoping to use the deaths of paedophile clergy to stymy more than a dozen cases brought by historical abuse survivors, an analysis of court records suggests. The strategy, largely adopted in New South Wales, relies on a key decision last year in the state’s highest court, which found the death of Father Clarence Anderson, an abuser long known to the Lismore diocese, rendered the church unable to fairly defend itself against allegations of abuse. NSW police officer stalked woman | Joshua Alan James Wootton, 32, has pleaded guilty to stalking a woman over a period of 11 days in February 2022 and searching for details about her partner using the restricted Cops database. Wootton will face a sentence hearing on 9 June. Tasmanian devils overwhelming possums | The introduction of Tasmanian devils to Maria Island has halved the population of brushtail possums. Don’t be alarmed – researchers say the possums had expanded beyond their usual habitat and restoring a top predator like the Tasmanian devil has helped keep them in check. Massive EV parking fines | If you happen to park your car in an EV charging space, you could be in for a hefty fine. States and territories have been introducing fines, starting with $3,200 in the Australian Capital Territory, $2,875 in Queensland, $2,200 in New South Wales and $369 in Victoria. The Cyclone Freddy death toll | … has passed 200 as people in Malawi and Mozambique pick up the pieces after the record-breaking storm. Rescue workers warned that more victims were likely as they scoured destroyed neighbourhoods for survivors. Honduras to switch ties from Taiwan to China | The Central American country’s switch would leave Taiwan with formal diplomatic relations with only 13 countries. China has intensified pressure to reduce Taiwan’s international standing, and this morning flew 28 military planes across the Taiwan strait, 16 of which crossed the median line. Full Story The teals, farmers and traditional owners fighting Santos The rich farmlands of NSW’s Liverpool Plains have long been coveted by fossil fuel companies.

What they said … *** “We’ve heard so much about how tight the budget is, and it is … And we’ve heard that we can’t spend money on things that are really important to our communities and to our country. And this [Aukus] is a massive spending commitment for decades to come.” – David Pocock The independent senator questioned how the government intends to finance the massive defence spend, calling on Labor to axe the $243bn stage-three tax cuts that will benefit the wealthy. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, repeated his refusal to scrap the tax cuts. In numbers And about 42% of men reported experiencing physical violence since the age of 15, according to the latest ABS data.

                    "bodyText": "Power bills for households in three states will rise as much as 23.7% from 1 July if the Australian Energy Regulator’s draft determination, announced on Wednesday, is confirmed. Prices in Victoria may rise by almost a third. The AER chair, Clare Savage, said the increases were “significant” but they could have been as much as 40% to 50% without the federal government’s intervention in December to cap domestic gas and black coal prices. The electricity price safety net, also known as the default market offer, is intended to set maximum increases for households and small business customers on standard retail plans in South Australia, New South Wales and south-east Queensland. Victoria releases its own default offer. In NSW, residential customers face price increases of as much as 23.7%, or 16.9 percentage points higher than the inflation rate. Those in south-east Queensland face increases of as much as 19.8% and residents in South Australia as much as 21.8%, the AER said. For small business customers, prices will increase between 14.7% and 25.4% depending on their region, the regulator said. Victoria also released its own draft decision for consultation, proposing the average annual bill for domestic customers on the Victorian Default Offer will rise 31.1%, with small business customers facing increases of 33.2%. “The draft decision proposes an increase of around $426 for residential customers, with typical bills increasing from $1,403 to around $1,829 per year,” the state’s Essential Services Commission said. “For small business customers, typical bills would increase by around $1,738, from $5,620 to around $7,358 per year.” The AER said customers should shop around to minimise the increases. “Based on offers available in February 2023, residential customers switching from a standing offer to the lowest market offer could save 7% to 17% and small business customers could save 9% to 26%, depending on their region,” the regulator said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Savage told ABC’s Radio National: “It’s not as bad as it could have been.” The federal government legislated to cap wholesale gas prices temporarily at $12 a gigajoule and cap coal prices at $125 a tonne, a move Treasury estimated would save the average households $230 on their electricity bills in the next financial year. The AER said forward contract prices for the 2023-24 financial year had begun to fall in south-east Queensland and NSW “as soon as the intervention was publicly mooted”. “Contract prices have now fallen by approximately 50% since the end of October,” it said. “However, despite this significant decline, the trade-weighted average prices for 2023-24 contracts are around $40 per megawatt-hour higher than they were at the start of 2022 in all regions.” On Monday the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said he expected the default offer to be “significantly lower than the AER’s predictions” before the government’s intervention in December. In November the AER advised that, without action, the residential default offer would increase by between 35% and 44% in NSW, 51% in South Australia, and 41% in south-east Queensland. Bowen revealed that the government estimated small business customers were on track to pay 37% more in NSW, 53% more in South Australia and 50% more in south-east Queensland. “We simply had to act,” he told the Sydney Institute. “But I know that will be cold comfort for people who will still have to deal with the resulting energy bill increases.” On Wednesday, Bowen said households would avoid increases of $268 – $530 because of the intervention. The savings for small businesses would reach as much as $1,243. Bowen noted that the government would deliver $1.5bn of energy price relief rebates, expected after the May budget. The Coalition’s energy spokesman, Ted O’Brien, said the higher prices were evidence of a “broken promise reconfirmed”, with more than 82,000 households now on hardship programs. “Energy bills have skyrocketed despite Labor’s promise of a $275 reduction and now they are set to soar even higher,” O’Brien said. “It’s further proof that Labor’s energy plan is failing.” Bruce Mountain, head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, called on Victoria’s Essential Services Commission to “think again” about its “problematic” recommended price increase. “They average contract prices over a 12-month period and so their calculation reflects the surge in contract prices from around June to October last year,” Mountain says. “But there is little evidence to suggest that these contract prices represent the costs that retailers will incur over the coming 12 month period,” he says. The result is that the increases - if maintained in the final decision - would “needlessly deliver large windfall profits particularly for Victoria’s large retailers, at customers’ expense”. “This is contrary to the government’s stated objective in introducing the VDO.” Data from Energy Action shows Victoria’s wholesale power prices jumped from the middle of last year but not as much as states to the north. The commission said wholesale power costs were up 95% from the 2022-23 year, and made up about 36% of the annual domestic bills. The Victorian government said households would still continue to pay less on average for their electricity than residents in south-east Queensland, NSW and South Australia. “We know that Victorian households are facing real pressures because of the increasing cost of energy globally,” said a spokesperson for the energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio. “That’s why we’ve fast-tracked a new round of the $250 power saving bonus and encourage Victorians to access our rebates for solar PV and hot water systems. “We’re also reducing our reliance on costly fossil fuels – that’s why we’re bringing back the State Electricity Commission and replacing unreliable, privatised coal with clean, government-owned, renewable energy.” The Victorian opposition leader, John Pesutto, said the government should explain why the proposed increase was larger for Victorians than elsewhere. “Four years ago, [premier] Daniel Andrews promised Victorians that he would reduce power prices through a default market offer,” Pesutto said. “Well today, he’s broken his promise and he owes Victorians an explanation for why they are paying more for energy prices than people living in other states around our country. People are doing it hard. They need relief, not energy price increases when they can least afford it.” Cassandra Goldie, chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, said the latest increase would land as a blow for consumers after increases of 20% last year. “People on the lowest incomes do not have anything left in their budgets to cut back on and are at breaking point,” Goldie said. ACOSS wants the federal government to adjust the AER’s guidelines for the default offer to lower retail margins as has been done in Victoria. The chief executive of Energy Consumers Australia, Lynne Gallagher, said as many as half of households could be missing out on assistance that they are eligible for, often because of red tape. “Retailers know when customers are not on the best deal and we’d like them to be more proactive in reaching out to offer them the best possible option,” she said. After consultation, the AER will issue its final default offer for the year in May."

                    "bodyText": "We’re closing this blog shortly. Here is a summary of both the drone incident and other news from the war over the last 24 hours: A Russian fighter collided with a US Reaper drone, forcing it down into the Black Sea, in what US forces called an “unsafe and unprofessional” intercept. A US European Command statement said the collision happened just after 7am on Tuesday, when two Russian Su-27 fighter jets flew up to the MQ-9 Reaper drone over international waters west of Crimea. The statement said the Russian pilots sought to disrupt the US aircraft before the collision. The US state department has summoned the Russia’s ambassador over the drone incident. The White House said the drone’s downing was unique and would be raised directly by state department officials with their Russian counterparts. The Russian ambassador to US said the incident was a ‘provocation’. Russia’s RIA state news agency cited Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to the United States, saying, “We view this incident as a provocation”. Antonov made the comments after being summoned to the US State Department. The Pentagon said the drone was on a routine ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) mission. US Air Force Brig Gen Pat Ryders said Russia did not have the drone. But he declined to say whether Russia was seeking the wreckage so that its military intelligence could dissect it. Russia’s defence ministry maintained that its fighters “did not use airborne weapons and did not come into contact” with the US drone. The ministry said fighters from its air defence forces were raised into the air to identify the drone, which the ministry said was heading “in direction of the state border of the Russian Federation”. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his military chiefs have agreed to keep defending the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut. Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the defence of Bakhmut was of “paramount strategic importance”. He said: “It is key to the stability of the defence of the entire front.” The UN was scrambling Tuesday to ensure a Ukrainian grain exports deal aimed to ease the global food crisis can continue, but its fate remained unclear days before the 18 March expiry date. Talks between top Russian and United Nations officials in Geneva ended Monday with Moscow saying it would not oppose prolonging the so-called Black Sea Grain Initiative, as many had feared. At least one person was killed and three people were injured in shelling of Kramatorsk, in the Donetsk region on Tuesday morning, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The Ukrainian president said six high-rise buildings were damaged, adding: “The evil state continues to fight against the civilian population. Every strike that takes an innocent life must result in a lawful and just sentence that punishes murder.” The Russian-installed “acting governor” of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region has said the position of the frontline in the region is stable, but that Russian forces are strengthening their positions in the area in anticipation of an attack. Speaking to Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency, Yevgeny Balitsky said: “Now all military operations are concentrated in the area of Vuhledar and Bakhmut, therefore, it is calm in our direction for the time being.” Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said his country could supply Ukraine with MIG fighter jets in the coming four to six weeks. Warsaw’s commitment to Kyiv has been important in persuading European allies to donate heavy weapons to Ukraine, including tanks. Russian artillery ammunition shortages have probably worsened “to the extent that extremely punitive shell-rationing is in force on many parts of the front”, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. “This has almost certainly been a key reason why no Russian formation has recently been able to generate operationally significant offensive action,” it said. Moscow has said it does not recognise the jurisdiction of the international criminal court in The Hague, after reports that the court is expected to seek its first arrest warrants against Russian individuals over the war in Ukraine. The prosecutor at the court will reportedly formally open two war crimes cases and issue arrest warrants for several Russians deemed responsible for the mass abduction of Ukrainian children and the targeting of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said 32 countries have joined a coalition supporting the creation of a special tribunal against Russia for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine, the EU and the Netherlands have publicly backed the idea of a special tribunal. Russia has denied accusations of war crimes including deliberate targeting of Ukrainian civilians. AFP journalists in Eastern Ukraine have reported seeing white phosphorus fired from Russian positions on an uninhabited road leading to nearby Bakhmut. They reported hearing whistling sounds followed by explosions caused by munitions that released small, burning balls of white phosphorus that slowly fell to the ground. The balls set fire to the vegetation on both sides of the road on a surface equivalent to the size of a football pitch. AFP was not able to confirm if the targeted site was a position held by Ukrainian forces, but a green truck with a white cross, a sign of Ukraine’s army, was parked by a path in the burned area. The Guardian is unable to verify these reports from AFP. Weapons containing phosphorus are incendiary arms whose use against civilians is banned, but they can be deployed against military targets under a 1980 convention signed in Geneva. Kyiv has accused Moscow of using them on several occasions since the start of the war, including against civilians, which the Russian army has denied categorically. The Russian defence ministry denied any contact between one of their Su-27 fighters and a US MQ-9 Reaper drone which crashed into the Black Sea on Tuesday, insisting the drone went down of its own accord. But the US allegations of dangerous flying and even dumping fuel on the Reaper to disrupt it are detailed – and the Russians have a long record of aggressive behaviour. A 2021 Rand Corporation study analysing dozens of close-shave incidents concluded it was a matter of policy, which Rand dubbed “coercive signalling”. “Sometimes the coercive signal is something like this: the plane will come up to interrogate the target, shadow at a distance, with wings clean (no missiles) but increasingly with wings dirty (with missiles) as our bilateral relations have deteriorated, and it will leave,” Dara Massicot, one of the report’s authors, said on Twitter in the wake of the drone incident. “Sometimes, usually after other methods were used, Russian signalling would shift to something unsafe and unprofessional to compel a change.” The change they are trying to compel in this case is to keep US aircraft and boats away from the fringes of the Ukraine war, where Russia’s invasion remains stalled and hugely costly, and Ukrainian forces are benefiting from US intelligence support. There have been a string of instances of close encounters since Russia’s initial invasion in 2014. Tuesday’s incident is more serious because it led to a collision and a crash landing in the sea. It was quite possibly an error. The US European Command pointed to incompetence on the part of the Russian pilot. But Massicot said that in this case “a deliberate bump cannot be ruled out yet”. There are open military lines of communication and longstanding conflict-deescalation mechanisms in place to stop scenarios getting out of hand, but every time something like this happens, the world uses up a little bit more of its luck. Read Julian’s full analysis here The Associated Press has this handy explainer: The MQ-9 Reaper is a large unmanned air force aircraft that is remotely operated by a two-person team. It includes a ground control station and satellite equipment and has a 66-foot (20-meter) wingspan. The team includes a rated pilot who is responsible for flying the aircraft and an enlisted aircrew member who is charged with operating the sensors and guiding weapons. Used routinely during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars for surveillance and airstrikes, the Reaper can be either armed or unarmed. It can carry up to eight laser-guided missiles, including Hellfire missiles and other sophisticated munitions, and can loiter over targets for about 24 hours. It is about 36ft long, 12ft high, and weighs about 4,900 pounds (11 meters long, 4 meters high, and 2,200 kilograms). It can fly at an altitude of up to 50,000 feet (15 kilometres) and has a range of about 1,400 nautical miles (2,500 kilometres). The Reaper, which first began operating in 2007, replaced the air force’s smaller Predator drones. Each Reaper costs about $32m. Hi, my name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be taking you through the news for the next while. If you’re just joining us, you may be wondering why the US was flying a drone over the Black Sea. The Pentagon said the drone was on a routine ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) mission. In a statement, US air force General James Hecker, said, ““Our MQ-9 aircraft was conducting routine operations in international airspace when it was intercepted and hit by a Russian aircraft, resulting in a crash and complete loss of the MQ-9”. The statement added: “US air forces in Europe – air forces Africa routinely fly aircraft throughout Europe over sovereign territory and throughout international airspace in coordination with applicable host nation and international laws. In order to bolster collective European defense and security, these missions support Allied, partner, and US national objectives.” Reuters has more from the Russian ambassador to the US: Antonov said his meeting at the State Department was “constructive” and the issue of possible “consequences” for Moscow over the incident was not raised, RIA reported. “As for us, we do not want any confrontation between the United States and Russia. We are in favour of building pragmatic relations for the benefit of the Russian and American peoples,” Antonov was quoted as saying. Moscow views the incident involving a Russian Su-27 fighter jet and a US military drone over the Black Sea as provocation, Russia’s RIA state news agency cited Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to the United States, as saying on Tuesday. “We view this incident as a provocation,” Antonov said after being summoned by the US State Department. A Russian fighter has collided with a US Reaper drone, forcing it down into the Black Sea, in what US forces called an “unsafe and unprofessional” intercept.

Russia’s defence ministry maintained that its fighters “did not use airborne weapons and did not come into contact” with the US drone. The ministry said fighters from its air defence forces were raised into the air to identify the drone, which the ministry said was heading “in direction of the state border of the Russian Federation”. US Air Force Brig Gen Pat Ryders said Russia did not have the drone. But he declined to say whether Russia was seeking the wreckage so that its military intelligence could dissect it. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his military chiefs have agreed to keep defending the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, the Ukrainian leader’s office has said. Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the defence of Bakhmut was of “paramount strategic importance”. He said: “It is key to the stability of the defence of the entire front.” At least one person was killed and three people were injured in shelling of Kramatorsk, in the Donetsk region, on Tuesday morning, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. The Ukrainian president said six high-rise buildings were damaged, adding: “The evil state continues to fight against the civilian population. Every strike that takes an innocent life must result in a lawful and just sentence that punishes murder.” The Russian-installed “acting governor” of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region has said the position of the frontline in the region is stable, but that Russian forces are strengthening their positions in the area in anticipation of an attack. Speaking to Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency, Yevgeny Balitsky said: “Now all military operations are concentrated in the area of Vuhledar and Bakhmut, therefore, it is calm in our direction for the time being.” Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said his country could supply Ukraine with MIG fighter jets in the coming four to six weeks. Warsaw’s commitment to Kyiv has been important in persuading European allies to donate heavy weapons to Ukraine, including tanks. Russian artillery ammunition shortages have probably worsened “to the extent that extremely punitive shell-rationing is in force on many parts of the front”, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. “This has almost certainly been a key reason why no Russian formation has recently been able to generate operationally significant offensive action,” it said. Moscow has said it does not recognise the jurisdiction of the international criminal court in The Hague, after reports that the court is expected to seek its first arrest warrants against Russian individuals over the war in Ukraine. The prosecutor at the court will reportedly formally open two war crimes cases and issue arrest warrants for several Russians deemed responsible for the mass abduction of Ukrainian children and the targeting of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said 32 countries have joined a coalition supporting the creation of a special tribunal against Russia for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine, the EU and the Netherlands have publicly backed the idea of a special tribunal. Russia has denied accusations of war crimes including deliberate targeting of Ukrainian civilians. Russia and Ukraine are at odds over the length of the extension of the Black Sea grain deal. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, said the deal had been extended on the previous conditions for 60 days, but Ukraine argues that the July 2022 agreement clearly states that extensions are possible for a minimum of 120 days. Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, the top two Republicans in polling regarding the 2024 presidential nomination, have said defending Ukraine is not a vital US interest, in remarks that will demoralise Kyiv and encourage Vladimir Putin to believe that time is on his side. Trump said the Ukraine war was not a vital US interest “but it is for Europe … that is why Europe should be paying far more than we are, or equal.” Lithuania’s parliament voted unanimously on Tuesday to designate Russia’s Wagner mercenary group as a terrorist organisation, accusing it of “systematic, serious crimes of aggression” in Ukraine. Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, thanked the Lithuanian parliament for its decision and called on others to follow suit. Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, has said the likelihood that Finland will join the Nato military alliance before Sweden has increased, though he said Swedish membership was only a matter of time. Turkey has been clear it has greater objections concerning Sweden’s accession than Finland’s, and Kristersson said that position still remained, meaning the two countries might not join together as they prefer. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Germany remains “occupied” by the US based on the country’s response to the blasts that hit Russia’s Nord Stream gas pipelines last year. “The matter is that European politicians have said themselves publicly that after World War II, Germany was never a fully sovereign state,” Russian news agencies quoted Putin saying on state Rossiya-1 TV channel. Germany has said it believes the blasts were a deliberate act, but has declined to say who might be responsible. As the Guardian reported last week: German prosecutors have confirmed investigators have searched a boat that may have been used in last year’s Nord Stream gas pipeline bombings, but ministers urged caution over hasty conclusions about reports a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible. Citing intelligence reviewed by US officials, the New York Times reported on Tuesday a saboteur group had blown up the pipelines, while Die Zeit said the attack had been carried out by five men and a woman who rented a yacht using false passports. The report, while not suggesting Ukrainian state involvement, comes as Kyiv urges its western allies urgently to increase arms and ammunition supplies to drive back Russian forces as the war enters its second year. Russia has blamed the US and the UK for the sabotage. The fiancee of Dmytro Kotsiubailo, better known as “Da Vinci” has handed his personal chevron to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Kotsiubailo was one of best-known fighters, joining the army after protesting in the Maidan Revolution in 2014. By the time Russia launched an invasion, he has become the youngest battalion commander in the Ukrainian military. Kotsiubailo was killed recently in Bakhmut, the eastern Ukrainian city that has seen deadly fighting since August and remains contested. He was 27. Zelenskiy and the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, attended a memorial service for him last week. The commander was made a “Hero of Ukraine” by Zelenskiy in 2022, even before Russia’s full-scale invasion, for his role resisting pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. The Russian ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, has arrived at the State Department in Washington. Antonov was summoned after a Russian fighter jet collided with a US Reaper drone, over the Black Sea. US forces called the incident an “unsafe and unprofessional” intercept. Antonov was summoned to “convey our strong objections,” said State Department spokesman Ned Price. Kira Rudik, a prominent member of the Ukrainian parliament, has just tweeted that Ukrainian soldiers have completed their training on the Leopard 2 tanks in Germany. Germany confirmed in January that it would make 14 Leopard 2A6 tanks available for Ukraine’s war effort, and give partner countries permission to re-export further battle tanks to Kyiv, overcoming misgivings about sending heavy weaponry that Ukraine sees as crucial to defeat the Russian invasion. Chancellor Olaf Scholz had come under pressure for weeks and his seeming hesitancy on the question of delivering the battle tanks wanted by the Zelenskiy government had caused growing consternation among western allies. US Air Force Brig Gen Pat Ryder has been careful to avoid giving details of the fate of the wrecked American MQ-9 Reaper drone that had to be ditched into the Black Sea by the US military after being damaged by a Russian fighter jet that was buzzing it and collided with its propeller. “Russia does not have the drone,” Ryder told gathered journalists. He did not say whether Russia was attempting to gather up the wreckage but there is no doubt that Vladimir Putin’s military intelligence would be eager to do so and dissect it. The unmanned aerial vehicle could have been monitoring Russian warships in the area that are part of the Black Sea fleet. California-based General Atomics produces the Reaper for the US Air Force and it’s a large and expensive piece of hi-tech kit that can comfortably fly at an altitude of 50,000ft. The US government also uses MQ-9 drones to monitor the US-Mexico border to identify migrants trying to cross into the US outside of official border posts. There are reports that Russia has retrieved some drone wreckage from the Black Sea but this is unverified and unconfirmed so far. It’s just past 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A Russian fighter has collided with a US Reaper drone, forcing it down into the Black Sea, in what US forces called an “unsafe and unprofessional” intercept. A US European Command statement said the collision happened just after 7am on Tuesday, when two Russian Su-27 fighter jets flew up to the MQ-9 Reaper drone over international waters west of Crimea. The statement said the Russian pilots sought to disrupt the US aircraft before the collision. The US state department said it was summoning Russia’s ambassador over the drone incident. The White House said the drone’s downing was unique and would be raised directly by state department officials with their Russian counterparts.

Russia’s defence ministry in a statement said that its fighters “did not use airborne weapons and did not come into contact” with the US drone. The ministry said fighters from its air defence forces were raised into the air to identify the drone, which the ministry said was heading “in direction of the state border of the Russian Federation”. “As a result of sharp manoeuvring around 9.30 (Moscow time), the MQ-9 unmanned aerial vehicle went into uncontrolled flight with a loss of altitude and collided with the water surface,” the ministry said, adding that its fighter jets returned safely to their base. The collision of the Russian fighter jet with the US drone over the Black Sea will probably have caused some damage to the Russian aircraft, Brig Gen Pat Ryder has said. He told reporters: What we saw were fighter aircraft dumping fuel in front of this UAV and then getting so close to the aircraft that it actually damaged the propeller on the MQ-9. We assess that it likely caused some damage to the Russian aircraft as well. Brig Gen Pat Ryder of the US air force is speaking at a news conference after the collision of a Russian fighter jet with a US drone over the Black Sea. He cites a US European Command statement that said Russian aircraft conducted an “unsafe and unprofessional” intercept with a US unmanned aircraft that was operating within international airspace. He said: At approximately 7.03am CET, one of the Russian Su-27 aircraft struck the propeller of the MQ-9, causing US forces to have to bring the MQ-9 down in international waters. Several times before the collision, the Su-27s dumped fuel on and flew in front of the MQ-9 in a reckless and unprofessional manner. This incident demonstrates a lack of competence in addition to being unsafe and unprofessional. He said such kinds of US aircraft had been flying over the Black Sea region for some time, adding that it was an “important and busy international waterway”. You can watch his news conference live here: The US will summon the Russian ambassador over the collision of a Russian fighter jet with a US drone over the Black Sea, the US state department’s spokesperson Ned Price has said. The US ambassador to Moscow conveyed a strong message to Russia’s foreign affairs ministry, Price said, adding that US officials had briefed allies and partners over the incident. Ukrainian officials have said a Russian missile hit a residential building in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk on Tuesday. The rocket killed at least one person and injured three others, said President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The city of Kramatorsk is just over 50km away from the frontline city of Bakhmut, which has seen some of the most intense fighting anywhere in Ukraine since Russia invaded last year. Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, has arrived in Moscow for talks with Vladimir Putin, according to the Syrian presidency. The trip is Assad’s first official visit outside the Middle East since last month’s devastating earthquake, according to a statement. The statement said Assad would hold talks with Putin during his visit, alongside a large Syrian ministerial delegation. Here’s more from the White House spokesperson John Kirby on the incident over the Black Sea in which a Russian Su-27 fighter jet struck the propeller of a US military surveillance drone. Joe Biden was briefed about the incident, Kirby told reporters. He added that state department officials would be “speaking directly” with their Russian counterparts and “expressing our concerns over this unsafe and unprofessional intercept”. Kirby said that while there have been other such intercepts, this one was noteworthy because it was “unsafe and unprofessional” and caused the downing of a US aircraft. “So it’s unique in that regard,” he said. The incident would not deter the US from operating over the Black Sea, he said. The Black Sea belongs to no one nation. And we’re going to continue to do what we need to do for our national security interests in that part of the world. Nato’s top military commander, Gen Christopher Cavoli, has informed allies about an incident over the Black Sea involving a Russian fighter jet and a US military drone, according to a Nato official. The White House spokesperson John Kirby has been speaking about a Russian fighter jet that collided with a US military drone over the Black Sea earlier today. Kirby said it was not uncommon for there to be intercepts by Russian aircraft of US aircraft over the Black Sea, but “this one is noteworthy because of how unsafe and unprofessional it was”. From Voice of America’s Patsy Widakuswara: A Russian Su-27 fighter jet has collided with a US military drone over the Black Sea, causing the drone to crash, according to the US military. The American MQ-9 Reaper drone and two SU-27 Flanker jets were conducting a routine operation in international airspace when one of the Russian jets intentionally flew in front of and dumped fuel in front of the unmanned drone, according to a US official familiar with the incident. In a statement, Gen James Hecker, who overseas the US air force in the region, said: Our MQ-9 aircraft was conducting routine operations in international airspace when it was intercepted and hit by a Russian aircraft, resulting in a crash and complete loss of the MQ-9. In fact, this unsafe and unprofessional act by the Russians nearly caused both aircraft to crash. US and allied aircraft will continue to operate in international airspace and we call on the Russians to conduct themselves professionally and safely. Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, the top two Republicans in polling regarding the 2024 presidential nomination, have said defending Ukraine is not a vital US interest, in remarks that will demoralise Kyiv and encourage Vladimir Putin to believe that time is on his side. Trump, a longstanding Putin admirer, has been consistently sceptical about US support for Ukraine, and has suggested he could broker a peace deal, involving Ukraine surrendering territory. DeSantis had previously tried to dodge questions on Ukraine, and his new comments are likely to shift sentiment in the Republican party further from support of Ukraine. Both men answered a questionnaire from Tucker Carlson, the primetime Fox News host, who posted the responses to Twitter. DeSantis, the governor of Florida, said the US should not “become further entangled” in the Russia-Ukraine war. Trump, the former president who dominates polling, said the Ukraine war was not a vital US interest “but it is for Europe … that is why Europe should be paying far more than we are, or equal”. Read the full story here: President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his military chiefs have “expressed a common position” to keep defending the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, the Ukrainian leader’s office has said. General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the defence of Bakhmut was of “paramount strategic importance”. “It is key to the stability of the defence of the entire front,” he said. In a statement, Zelenskiy’s office said the Ukrainian president and top government officials and military commanders had discussed the situation in Bakhmut, where Russian and Ukraine forces are taking heavy casualties. It said: After considering the defensive operation in the Bakhmut direction, all … expressed a common position to continue holding and defending the city of Bakhmut. Zelenskiy and the military command also discussed the pace and scale of the supply of weapons and equipment from Ukraine’s western allies, and how to allocate them to the troops, it said. It’s just past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: At least one person has been killed and three people injured in the shelling of Kramatorsk in Donetsk region on Tuesday morning, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. The Ukrainian president said “six high-rise buildings were damaged”, adding: “The evil state continues to fight against the civilian population. Every strike that takes an innocent life must result in a lawful and just sentence that punishes murder.” The Russian-installed “acting governor” of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region has said the position of the frontline in the region is “stable”, but that Russian forces are strengthening their positions in the area in anticipation of an attack. Speaking to Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency, Yevgeny Balitsky said: “Now all military operations are concentrated in the area of Vuhledar and Bakhmut, therefore, it is calm in our direction for the time being.” Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed in its latest update that in the past 24 hours its forces have killed over 700 Russian troops. It also said that it has destroyed 10 tanks, 15 armoured combat vehicles, 16 pieces of artillery and 11 drones. The claims have not been independently verified. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said his country could supply Ukraine with MIG fighter jets in the coming four to six weeks.

Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here with all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has thanked the Lithuanian parliament for its decision to label the Wagner mercenary group as a terrorist organisation, and called on others to follow suit. The Russian-installed “acting governor” of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region has told Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass that the position of the frontline in the region is “stable”, but that Russian forces are strengthening their positions in the area in anticipation of an attack. Yevgeny Balitsky, one of the leaders of the occupied regions of Ukraine who attended the annexation ceremony in Moscow in September last year, is quoted as saying: We have all regiments, all divisions complete. We are waiting for the enemy, because by and large we know that there is a strike group in the Zaporizhzhia region, respectively, we are strengthening our positions, waiting for the enemy to attack. Now all military operations are concentrated in the area of Vuhledar and Bakhmut, therefore, it is calm in our direction for the time being. And we are preparing for any provocative action by the enemy. Isobel Koshiw and Lorenzo Tondo report for the Guardian today on the Ukrainian volunteers who search for Russian corpses: The aim is to collect Russian bodies to exchange for Ukrainians, since a soldier cannot be declared dead by the state until there is a body, but the process of extracting them is extremely risky. Like much of the deoccupied areas, Krasnopillia is littered with antipersonnel mines. Russia has been using remote mining systems that scatter tiny mines from the air. There have also been several instances of Russian forces booby-trapping bodies and houses before retreating. “The mines are dropped from rockets and so they can be anywhere. They can even be caught in trees and blow off in the wind,” said one volunteer, Artur, who was piloting a donated drone to document the bodies’ recovery. The Ukrainian volunteer body collectors belong to a group called Black Tulip, and say they have unearthed 311 Russian soldiers in deoccupied areas since February. Comprising about 10 volunteers, they are one of several groups, as well as Ukrainian military units, who scour the deoccupied areas and frontlines looking for corpses. Read more of Isobel Koshiw and Lorenzo Tondo’s report from Krasnopillia, which is accompanied by photographs from Alessio Mamo: The body collectors – Ukrainian volunteers search for Russian corpses Hungary’s ruling party lawmakers want to postpone next week’s parliament session, which means a further delay in its ratification of Finland and Sweden’s Nato admission, an opposition party lawmaker said on Tuesday. Reuters reports Ágnes Vadai, of the leftist Democratic Coalition, said in a Facebook post she had received a letter from deputy prime minister Zsolt Semjén informing her that the ruling party Fidesz and the Christian Democrats want to postpone the session which would have started on Monday. Sweden and Finland applied last year for membership of the transatlantic military alliance after Russian forces invaded Ukraine. All 30 Nato members must ratify the applications, and Hungary and Turkey are the only two to have held back their approvals. Vladimir Putin has been addressing workers at an aviation factory, where he said the “survival of Russian statehood” was at stake in Ukraine. Repeating his argument that the west was determined to pull Russia apart, Putin said: For us this is not a geopolitical task, but a task of the survival of Russian statehood, creating conditions for the future development of the country and our children. He added that the Russian economy had proved stronger than expected following western sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine: It turned out, for many of us, and even more so for western countries, that the fundamental foundations of Russia’s stability are much stronger than anyone thought. Russian troops launched a missile attack on Odesa region using tactical aircraft, Ukraine’s operational command south said in an update earlier this afternoon. It said the Russian missiles were downed over the sea, but the debris and blast wave damaged a kindergarten on the coastline and several private houses. No casualties have been reported, it said. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said 32 countries have joined a coalition supporting the creation of a special tribunal against Russia for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine, the EU and the Netherlands have publicly backed the idea of a special tribunal. Russia has denied accusations of war crimes including deliberate targeting of Ukrainian civilians. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said his country could supply Ukraine with MIG fighter jets in the coming four to six weeks. Western countries that have provided Ukraine with weapons have so far declined to send fighter jets. Poland has said it would be willing to send war planes in a coalition of countries. Warsaw’s commitment to Kyiv has been important in persuading European allies to donate heavy weapons to Ukraine, including tanks. Russia’s lower house of parliament, the State Duma, has backed an amendment that would punish those found guilty of discrediting “volunteer” groups fighting in Ukraine, in a move that would include fighters working for the private mercenary Wagner group. The amendment will need to be approved by the parliament’s upper house, before passing to President Vladimir Putin for final approval, Reuters reports. Under the current legislation, “discrediting” the Russian army can be punished by up to five years in prison, while spreading knowingly false information about it can attract a 15-year jail sentence. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires from the aftermath of a Russian missile strike on an apartment building in the centre of Kramatorsk, in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. At least one person has been killed and three wounded by the attack, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Moscow has said it does not recognise the jurisdiction of the international criminal court in The Hague, after reports that the court is expected to seek its first arrest warrants against Russian individuals over the war in Ukraine. “We do not recognise this court; we do not recognise its jurisdiction,” Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told journalists in Moscow on Tuesday morning. The New York Times and Reuters news agency reported on Monday that the prosecutor at the international criminal court (ICC) would formally open two war crimes cases and issue arrest warrants for several Russians deemed responsible for the mass abduction of Ukrainian children and the targeting of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. If successful, it would be the first time ICC warrants have been issued in relation to the invasion of Ukraine. Reports of imminent arrest warrants come just over a year after the prosecutor Karim Khan opened an investigation into possible war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in Ukraine. Over the past 12 months, he has made three trips to the country and visited sites of alleged war crimes. Read the full story here: Russia and Ukraine are at odds over the length of the extension of the Black Sea grain deal, with Moscow seeking to extend for 60 days, and Ukraine insisting that 120 days is the minimum permitted extension. Russian deputy foreign minister Alexander Grushko said the deal had been extended on the previous conditions for 60 days, however Ukraine argues that the July 2022 agreement clearly states that extensions are possible for a minimum of 120 days, and the original agreement should be amended if parties want a shorten terms. Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted to his Telegram channel to confirm that one person has been killed and three people injured in the shelling of Kramatorsk in Donetsk region on Tuesday morning. He wrote that “six high-rise buildings were damaged”, and that “The evil state continues to fight against the civilian population. Every strike that takes an innocent life must result in a lawful and just sentence that punishes murder.” Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, reported that another civilian had been killed Tuesday morning as a result of Russian military action – a 55-year-old woman whose car was hit in Vovchansk. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday Russia does not recognise the jurisdiction of the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague. Peskov was being asked about reports the ICC was expected to seek its first arrest warrants against Russian individuals in relation to the conflict in Ukraine shortly. Nataliya Humenyuk, head of the joint coordination press centre of the southern defence forces of Ukraine, has claimed that over the past day, Ukrainian forces destroyed eight units of equipment and killed 14 Russian soldiers on the islands of the Dnieper River delta. Suspilne reports she said on television that the Russian army had tried to deploy observation points on them in order to see what the defence forces on the north bank of the river were preparing. Ukraine’s defence ministry claims in its latest update that in the last 24 hours its forces have killed over 700 Russian troops. It also says that it has destroyed ten tanks, 15 armoured combat vehicles, 16 pieces of artillery and 11 drones. The claims have not been independently verified. In its latest daily intelligence briefing, the UK’s Ministry of Defence asserts that “In recent weeks, Russian artillery ammunition shortages have likely worsened to the extent that extremely punitive shell-rationing is in force on many parts of the front. This has almost certainly been a key reason why no Russian formation has recently been able to generate operationally significant offensive action.” The Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said on Tuesday that the likelihood that Finland would join the Nato military alliance before Sweden had increased, though Swedish membership was only a matter of time. Lithuania’s parliament voted unanimously on Tuesday to designate Russia’s Wagner mercenary group “a terrorist organisation”, accusing it of “systematic, serious crimes of aggression” in Ukraine Authorities in the Indonesian island Bali have asked the government to cancel a visa on arrival policy for Ukrainians and Russians, citing concerns that citizens of the two countries were violating local laws and regulations. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that power outages are possible today in the capital Kyiv. Citing Ukrenergo, it reports that stabilising outages are operating in some places, and that power outages are possible in Kharkiv and Zhytomyr regions. Lithuania’s parliament voted unanimously on Tuesday to designate Russia’s Wagner mercenary group “a terrorist organisation”, accusing it of “systematic, serious crimes of aggression” in Ukraine, Reuters reports. The Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said on Tuesday that the likelihood that Finland would join the Nato military alliance before Sweden had increased, though Swedish membership was only a matter of time. Sweden and Finland applied to join Nato last year but have faced objections from Turkey which says the two countries harbour members of what it considers terrorist groups. The countries resumed talks on the process in Brussels last week. Ankara has been clear it has greater objections concerning Sweden’s accession than Finland’s, and Kristersson said Turkey’s position in that regard still remained, meaning the two countries might not join together as they prefer. “What we have encountered in recent weeks is that the probability of this happening at different times has increased,” Reuters reports Kristersson told a news conference in Stockholm before leaving on a visit to Germany. “At the end of the day, it is not a matter of whether Sweden becomes a member of Nato, but when.” Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, reports that another civilian has been killed this morning as a result of Russian military action. He posted to Telegram: The enemy continues to shell civilians and civilian infrastructure of Vovchansk. Unfortunately, people die. Today, around 10am, during the shelling of the city, an enemy projectile hit a civilian car. A 55-year-old woman who was in it died on the spot. Russia have been invited to compete in the Central Asian Football Association (Cafa) Championship in June, amid speculation over a switch to the Asian confederation (AFC) as the country seeks a return to international competition. Russian teams have been suspended from European and Fifa competitions since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russia and Ukraine are at odds over the length of the extension of the Black Sea grain deal, with Moscow seeking to extend for 60 days, and Ukraine insisting that 120 days is the minimum permitted extension. Russia’s Tass news agency earlier cited Russian deputy foreign minister Alexander Grushko as saying the deal, which helps Ukraine export agricultural products following Russia’s invasion, had been extended on the previous conditions for 60 days. But Reuters reports a senior Ukrainian government official told it that Ukraine will stick to the terms of an agreement, which mandates a 120-day extension. “We will follow the agreement strictly,” the official, who declined to be named, told Reuters. A Russian source said separately earlier on Tuesday that the 60-day extension meant that after 60 days one of the parties may raise the issue of the deal’s termination. Ukraine argues that the July agreement clearly states that extensions are possible for a minimum of 120 days, and the original agreement should be amended if parties want a shorten terms. “The Russians realised that 60 days is not legally possible, so they are trying to find a way out,” the senior Ukrainian government official said. Kyiv had previously said that it wanted to extend the deal by at least one year, and that Ukraine wanted the city of Mykolaiv’s ports included. Turkey’s defence ministry said on Tuesday that talks over the extension of the deal are still continuing. Turkey and the UN helped broker the original arrangement last July. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday Russia does not recognise the jurisdiction of the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague, Reuters reports. Citing Tass, Reuters says Peskov was being asked about reports the ICC was expected to seek its first arrest warrants against Russian individuals in relation to the conflict in Ukraine shortly. Peskov also said that Kyiv’s position means Russia’s goals in Ukraine can only be achieved by “military means”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to his Telegram channel to confirm that one person has been killed and three people injured in the shelling of Kramatorsk in Donetsk region this morning. Ukraine’s president writes: Kramatorsk. A Russian missile hit the city center. Six high-rise buildings were damaged. At least three people were injured. One person died. My condolences to the family! Rescue operations are still ongoing. The evil state continues to fight against the civilian population. Destroying life and leaving nothing human. Every strike that takes an innocent life must result in a lawful and just sentence that punishes murder. It will definitely be that way. Nataliya Humenyuk, head of the joint coordination press centre of the southern defence forces of Ukraine, has claimed that over the past day, Ukrainian forces destroyed eight units of equipment and killed 14 Russian soldiers on the islands of the Dnieper River delta. Suspilne reports she said on television that the Russian army had tried to deploy observation points on them in order to see what the defence forces on the north bank of the river were preparing. The claims have not been independently verified. The air alarm has sounded in Kyiv again. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, is reporting that at least three civilians have been injured, and six high-rise buildings damaged in shelling of Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region this morning. The reports cited regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko. Suspilne is also reporting that explosions have been heard in Kherson by its correspondents. The city sits on the north bank of the Dnieper River. Russian forces occupy the area of Kherson region which is south of the river, and it is one of the regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. Authorities in the Indonesian island Bali have asked the government to cancel a visa on arrival policy for Ukrainians and Russians, citing concerns that citizens of the two countries were violating local laws and regulations. Russians make up one of the biggest groups of foreign visitors to Indonesia, and many stayed in Bali during the pandemic and following the invasion of Ukraine. But local people’s patience with tourists has worn thin, due to frequent reports of unlawful or disrespectful behaviour, and of foreigners working illegally while staying on tourist visas. Bali Governor Wayan Koster said he had written to the Law and Human Rights Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minister to request that they revoke the visas on arrival policy for Russian and Ukrainian citizens visiting Bali, saying there was a significant problem with citizens from the two countries breaching rules. “Because the two countries are at war, they don’t feel comfortable in their own country. So they come to Bali,” Koster said, according to a report by Tempo. Local people in Bali have taken to social media over recent years to complain about tourist behaviour – this includes instances where social media influencers violated Covid rules for online pranks during the pandemic, a model who posed naked at a sacred tree and a man who allegedly hit a pedestrian while driving under the influence of alcohol. More than 77,500 Russians arrived in Indonesia between September 2022 and January 2023 following the relaxation of Covid restrictions, according to Reuters. About 8,800 Ukrainian visitors arrived between September 2022 and January 2023. Koster said it is possible that other countries may also have visa on arrival entitlement revoked. The Law and Human Rights Ministry is yet to respond. Ukraine’s defence ministry claims in its latest update that in the last 24 hours its forces have killed over 700 Russian troops. It also says that it has destroyed ten tanks, 15 armoured combat vehicles, 16 pieces of artillery and 11 drones. The claims have not been independently verified. In its latest daily briefing of how it assesses the situation in Ukraine, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has asserted that “defence manufacturing capacity is a key vulnerability” in Russia’s campaign in Ukraine. It writes: In recent weeks, Russian artillery ammunition shortages have likely worsened to the extent that extremely punitive shell-rationing is in force on many parts of the front. This has almost certainly been a key reason why no Russian formation has recently been able to generate operationally significant offensive action. There is little respite in the air alarms in Ukraine so far this morning. Donetsk region declared an all clear a few minutes ago, and then just three minutes later declared a new air alert. Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv all also have active air alerts at the moment. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Britain’s refresh of its defence and foreign policy may mark the moment when the UK sobers up about its place in a world that it now describes as “defined by danger, disorder and division”, and increasingly tilting to authoritarianism. Gone is the optimistic Global Britain bombast of the Boris Johnson era, set out in the original integrated review only two years ago. That version championed the UK as “a beacon of democratic sovereignty” and one of the most influential countries in the world, and hailed its ability to draw on its post-Brexit status to “do things differently, economically and politically”. By contrast, the reworked review is a vision of a colder, darker and more hostile world where the interests of the west do not necessarily triumph. There is no shortage of patriotism, but warnings and forebodings fill every page: What has changed is that our collective security now is intrinsically linked to the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine. But the scale of these intensifying threats has only led to a modest increase in defence spending of £5bn over two years, mainly related to the Aukus nuclear submarine deal. There has been, however, a re-evaluation of the importance of alliances and partnerships to the UK. The emphasis now is less on the benefits of Britain going it alone, and more on the necessity for democracies to “out cooperate” the autocracies. For more on how the UK is reconsidering its position in the world, read Guardian diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour’s, full analysis: Partisan group Atesh claims to have killed the deputy head of the military administration of Nova Kakhovka just after midnight on Monday. In a post to the group’s telegram, it claims to have detonated a bomb killing the official as he approached his car outside a cafe on Pobedy Avenue and that no civilians were injured. The claims have not been verified. Atesh is a partisan group operating in parts of occupied Ukraine, made up of Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars and Russians since September 2022. It has previously claimed credit for a number of significant attacks on Russian personnel in occupied Ukraine, including a February 10 car bomb attack in the area of Nova Kakhovka which killed two Russian soldiers and injured two others. The prosecutor at the international criminal court will formally open two war crimes cases and issue arrest warrants for several Russians deemed responsible for the mass abduction of Ukrainian children and the targeting of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, according to reports on Monday. The New York Times and Reuters news agency reported that the prosecutor, Karim Khan, would ask pre-trial judges to approve arrest warrants on the basis of evidence collected so far. If successful, it would be the first time ICC warrants have been issued in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is not clear whether the warrants would be sealed, which would leave suspects guessing over whether they had been implicated. It is unlikely that the warrants would lead to trials as the ICC would not try the defendants in absentia, and Russia, which is not a member of the ICC, is highly unlikely to hand them over to the court, based in The Hague. For more on this story read the full report: In September 2022 The New York Times published an article that contained recordings from wiretaps of Russia troops where they spoke about looting, killing civilians and criticised their commanders. Independent Russian media outlet, Mediazone, tracked down 13 Russian soldiers whose calls were published by the NYT for a recently published longread, One soldier, referred to as Sergei, who was quoted in the NYT story as describing the invasion of Ukraine as a “criminal war” told Mediazone that even after a year he had not changed his mind. He was the only soldier that agreed to speak to the reporters or who did not insist they supported the war. During their calls quoted in the New York Times, Sergei told his girlfriend about looting by other soldiers and of the murder of three civilians. Adding further context to the Mediazone reporters, Sergei said: The conversation is incomplete. Personally, I didn’t kill anyone from a machine gun, I personally didn’t take civilians prisoner, it was our guards who did it. The situation was as follows: in front of my eyes, three prisoners were taken and taken away. We were told that they were taken away and would hardly be released. Peaceful or not, I can’t say for sure, everything was too far away. I saw them already naked. Sergei also described to the Mediazone reporters how he found a field of bodies in a forest near where he was serving. When asked why he did not refuse to obey orders if he considered the war illegal, he said he did not know: We were intimidated by prison. I just wanted to endure it all and come home alive. Of course, I could ask the lawyer everything, but there was no time for that, we didn’t sleep much, and in general it was more important for me to talk with my relatives. In general, I didn’t even think about it somehow A Russian soldier who had reportedly been hiding for about six months in abandoned buildings after the liberation of the Kharkiv region has been arrested by Ukrainian police. The soldier, a 42-year-old serviceman from the 27th Russian Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, was taken into custody on Monday as regional police officers patrolled villages in the Kupiansk-Vuzlovyi area. After he was searched, it turned out that the man, who is from the Moscow region, was a serviceman of the 27th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade of the Russian Federation. The detainee claimed he had been hiding since the liberation of the Kupiansk district by Ukraine’s armed forces. The man, dressed in civilian clothes, was apparently separated from his unit as they fled the Ukrainian counteroffensive last September. It is still unclear how he had managed to hide for the six months since the Russian retreat. For more on this story, read the full report below. Ukrainian forces have sustained significant losses since the start of the war as western officials have questioned the wisdom of holding Bakhmut since January, according to a report by The Washington Post. Speaking to serving members of the military and unnamed officials in western governments in the US and Europe, The Washing Post reports that Ukraine may have suffered as many as 120,000 killed and wounded during the conflict, compared to 200,000 on the Russian side – though it claims Ukraine keeps its casualty reports secret, even from its staunchest allies. The report suggests western training programs aren’t preparing soldiers fast enough and many of the junior offices who have received training over the last nine months have already been killed in action. It also claims Ukrainian security services closed down a telegram group that informed members about where authorities were distributing draft summonses. The Washington Post report closes with figures describing the aid promised by western governments but cites named and unnamed sources who wonder whether it will be too little, too late. Ukrainian defence forces repelled more than 100 attacks along the frontline, according to the General staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. In its latest update, it claimed Russian forces launched five rocket strikes against civil infrastructure in Sumy and Donetsk that resulted in deaths and injuries among civilians. The Russian airforce carried out 35 airstrikes and 76 rocket salvo attacks. Though it says the operational environment “has not changed significantly”, near Kupyansk and Lyman, Russian forces are mounting attacks against Ukrainian defences. Ukrainian forces carried out 10 airstrikes on Russian forces, and hit five concentration areas with artillery, along with three ammunition warehouses and four communications systems. Russian forces have made “marginal” gains in several parts of Ukraine according to the latest analysis by the Institute for The Study of War (ISW). Northeast of Kupyansk, Russian forces appeared to advance 17km and 7km east of Siversk. However the ISW says Russian forces have not been able to complete a turning movement around Bakhmut despite further advances in the area. Military bloggers associated with the Wagner Group have speculated the organisation is attempting to extend its flank west of Bakhmut to the Siversky Donetsk-Donbas water canal to create an “artificial operational encirclement”. These same commentators have also been growing concerned about a build up of Ukrainian troops and equipment that may signal a counterattack to break Wagner’s blockade of the city, and a broader offensive among the entire front line. Fierce fighting is raging for control of the centre of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, forces from both sides of the conflict have said, as casualties continue to mount in the longest and bloodiest battle of Russia’s war. Russia ratcheted up its efforts to take Bakhmut in early February after months of intense fighting around the town, and has since inched into the small city’s suburbs. Ukraine’s forces are now fighting off attacks from the north, east and south. Their only road out, to the west, is under Russian artillery fire. Ukraine insists there is a strategy behind continuing the fight for Bakhmut. The head of Ukraine’s ground forces, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Sunday that it was using the defence of Bakhmut to buy time until Ukraine is able to carry out an anticipated spring offensive. Syrskyi also said Ukraine was using the opportunity to kill as many Russian troops as possible and wear down its reserves. It is necessary to buy time to build reserves and launch a counteroffensive, which is not far off. [Ukrainian soldiers are] inflicting the heaviest possible losses, sparing neither themselves nor the enemy. For more on this story, read the full report. Russian has suggested renewing a crucial deal to allow the safe export of gain from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports for half the term of the previous agreement, Reuters reports. The proposal was first brokered between Russia and Ukraine by the United Nations and Turkey last July. Without this grain, a number of countries would experience a critical food shortage. In November the deal was extended for 120 days but is now expected to be renewed on Saturday for 60 days after Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin met with UN Officials in Geneva, citing restrictions on Russian agricultural exporters. Ukraine’s infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said that Russia’s stance went against the agreement, but did not reject Moscow’s 60-day proposal. [The grain] agreement involves at least 120 days of extension, therefore Russia’s position to extend the deal only for 60 days contradicts the document signed by Turkey and the UN. We’re waiting for the official position of the UN and Turkey as the guarantors of the initiative. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine – this is Royce Kurmelovs bringing you the latest developments. China’s president, Xi Jinping, is planning to visit Russia as soon as next week, according to sources speaking to the Reuters news agency. The visit comes after senior Chinese officials flagged that China’s values its relationship to Russia in the face of western hostility. Xi also plans to speak with Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the first time since the start of the war, according to the Wall Street Journal. China’s president is to speak virtually with his Ukrainian counterpart, probably after a visit to Moscow next week, the paper reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. The Institute for The Study of War (ISW) says Russian forces have made “marginal” gains in some parts of Ukraine. Crucially the ISW says Russian forces have not been able to complete an encircling operation in the area around Bakhmut despite small advances overnight. Meanwhile, Serbian economy minister Rade Basta called for sanctions to be imposed against Russia. Basta said Serbia, which has traditionally had a close relationship with Russia, had paid a “high price” for having delayed. In other developments: The Italian government has said Russian mercenary group Wagner is behind a surge in migrant boats trying to cross the central Mediterranean, as part of Moscow’s strategy to retaliate against countries supporting Ukraine, Reuters reported. Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin responded to the claims, saying, “We have no idea what’s happening with the migrant crisis, we don’t concern ourselves with it.” The international criminal court intends to open two war crimes cases tied to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and will seek arrest warrants for several people. The cases are the first international charges to be brought forward since the start of the conflict, the newspaper reports. Moscow says a deal allowing the safe export of grain from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports will be extended only for a period of 60 days, half the term of the previous renewal, Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin has said. Britain has declared that the UK’s security hinges on the outcome of the Ukraine war in an update to its foreign policy framework published on Monday. The UK will invest an extra £5bn in the armed forces over two years and increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. Britain’s Royal Navy said it was escorting a Russian frigate and tanker in waters close to the UK having shadowed the vessels through the Channel on Sunday morning. President Zelenskiy said his government will spend $13.5bn on defence, including military salaries and drones this year."

                    "bodyText": "The introduction of Tasmanian devils to Maria Island halved the population of brushtail possums, according to new research that suggests restoring top predators to ecosystems could help limit the number of overabundant prey. In 2012, the carnivorous marsupials were introduced to the island off the east coast of Tasmania to create a geographically isolated insurance population free from devil facial tumour disease. Australian researchers have tracked the impact of the introduction on brushtail possums, finding that “possum abundance fell by more than 50% across Maria Island as a whole”. Prior to the devils’ introduction, brushtail possums – which had been introduced to the island in the 1950s – had expanded beyond their usual habitat and had become “a pretty significant predator”, according to study co-author Prof Christopher Johnson of the University of Tasmania. “The place was sort of overwhelmed with possums. They were living in open grasslands a long way from trees,” Johnson said. “They were preying on seabirds – in fact, there were possums living in seabird burrows and coming out at night … and pulling [short-tailed shearwater] chicks out and killing them.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Brushtail possums are considered omnivores, but in most parts of their geographic range they primarily eat foliage, Johnson said. “They den in tree hollows and they feed in the tree canopy … They will come to the ground to feed but typically they don’t go very far from a tree.” A founding population of 28 Tasmanian devils was released on Maria Island in 2012 and 2013, growing to an estimated 100 animals by 2016 – the island’s predicted maximum capacity. Combining data from population surveys and GPS tracking of individual possums, the researchers found that the devils brought about the almost complete disappearance of possums from open grasslands and population decline in dry forest areas. Possum populations “remained stable in wet forests”. Within five years of the devils being introduced, surviving possums were restricted to forest habitats and using tree hollows as den sites, the team found. “In one sense, this is a story of what devils do to possums,” Johnson said. “But it’s also an instance of a bigger story about how predators can control the niche that is occupied by other species. “Predator introductions are pretty rare things still and because the ecological effects of predators in most cases unfold over long periods of time, there really aren’t very many examples like this one.” Johnson described Maria Island as a test case for other devil introductions. “If someone got serious about introducing devils on to the mainland of Australia, where they used to exist, you would need pretty good data on the impacts of devils on the ecosystem,” he said. “We’ve really proved in this case … that if management of possums was the goal, we could say that it worked and we could do it again.” In 2021, a BirdLife Tasmania survey found introduced devils had wiped out little penguins from Maria Island, which had been home to 3,000 breeding pairs of the flightless bird a decade earlier. Previous research conducted by the University of Tasmania scientists also found the devils decimated colonies of the island’s short-tailed shearwaters. The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B."

                    "bodyText": "Later this week, another late-season heatwave will sear New South Wales, potentially setting record electricity demand in March for the second time in less than a fortnight. For many people, the warmth will be welcome after years of relatively wet seasons and Sydney’s coolest summer for maximum temperatures in 11 years. However, a few within Dominic Perrottet’s government and the electricity sector may find it less relaxing. With the state election just over a week away, the incumbent Coalition can ill afford any hint of electricity disruptions to remind voters – much like the rolling risks for Sydney trains – that key infrastructure remains fragile. Energy issues haven’t been prominent in the election so far, with announcements focused primarily on how to get more renewable energy and storage on to the grid. It’s also a reflection of the tripartisan approach to decarbonisation efforts, with Labor and the Greens signing up to energy minister Matt Kean’s 20-year electricity roadmap launched in late 2020. It’s very unlikely that lights are about to go on the blink or air-conditioners fail. Still, unlike the early March heatwave, western Sydney is forecast to bake with four days from Thursday forecast to reach the mid to high-30s. Brisbane, too, is predicted to warm to 35C on Friday, adding load to the national grid that wasn’t there last week. The issue is the state has a finer margin for error than most voters realise, and that margin is about to narrow further. Just weeks after the election, the remaining three units of AGL Energy’s Liddell power station start to close. By 28 April, the 52-year-old clunker in the Hunter will shut, taking its remaining 1,260 megawatts – or about 10% of NSW’s capacity – offline. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Many of the problems NSW faces are not the government’s fault. Snowy Hydro’s $600m Kurri Kurri gas plant in the Hunter was supposed to be online before next summer to cover Liddell’s exit. That’s been delayed at least a year. Snowy’s gargantuan 2.0 pumped hydro project has its main borer stuck and few people expect the delayed 2027 deadline will be met. And Origin Energy’s decision to accelerate by seven years to 2025 the closure date of Eraring, Australia’s biggest power station with 2,880MW capacity, was also not envisaged by the roadmap. And those are the known issues. Will Centennial Coal keep supplying coal to EnergyAustralia’s Mt Piper power plant near Lithgow as speculation swirls over the future of both? (A spokesperson for Centennial said the firm “continues to work proactively with the NSW government and our customers to underpin the domestic energy market”, adding “there are no current issues impacting Centennial’s ability to supply Mt Piper”.) Whether key transmission lines linking the renewable zones and Snowy 2.0 will be delivered in a timely and economic manner, is another issue. Jihad Dib, Labor’s energy spokesman and the person set to be NSW’s next energy minister should his party form government, is not alone in being wary about what’s ahead. “It’s the most exhilarating, the most challenging job,” Dib tells Guardian Australia. “If you stuff up, you have a massive impact on people’s lives.” Dib supports Kean’s plan to replace coal plants with renewables and storage but says too little has been achieved in the two years since its launch. “It’s not about a glossy brochure or a press release,” Dib says. “I want to see not just a commitment [for investment], I want to see a connection.” A spokesman for Kean says the roadmap and its five designated renewable energy zones have attracted registrations of interest for 152 gigawatts of new projects. Those offerings amount to $283bn in private investments. “The first tender under the roadmap has received overwhelming interest with 16 projects with a combined capacity of 4.3GW, capable of powering the equivalent of almost 1.6m homes,” he said. “Results of these tenders are expected in the coming weeks.” Proponents of the plan say it has built-in flexibility reflected in the accelerated 850MW Waratah Super Battery – the largest committed battery in the southern hemisphere. It could be online by 2025, ahead of Eraring’s closure. The government also issued tenders at the end of last year for a 380MW so-called firming battery that would run for two hours to fill gaps. While adequate generation can be supplied, lowering costs for households and businesses will be a more difficult task, insiders say. NSW’s wholesale power prices are higher than Victoria’s and Queensland’s and the gap has lately been growing. One executive at a large renewable energy developer, though, reckons Dib is right to be concerned about the pace of execution. “The [roadmap] was great, and it remains very good,” the executive says. “It just isn’t being implemented ... It takes too long for projects to be approved. “If Eraring closes on time, they are definitely stuffed.” The executive predicts Origin Energy will demand a lot to keep running a plant the company claims to be spending $240m a year to maintain. Dylan McConnell, a University of NSW energy expert, says it’s surprising the grid remains so strained even after AGL flagged Liddell’s closure at least seven years ago. “How are we still in this position … given we’ve had such a long time?” he says. With the Bureau of Meteorology declaring on Tuesday the chance of an El Niño for later in the year is now 50/50, operators will likely have to prepare for much larger and intense heatwaves than this week’s. “It’s not hard to imagine that it will be very challenging next summer,” McConnell said."

The Russian defence ministry denied any contact between one of their Su-27 fighters and a US MQ-9 Reaper drone which crashed into the Black Sea on Tuesday, insisting the drone went down of its own accord. But the US allegations of dangerous flying and even dumping fuel on the Reaper to disrupt it are detailed – and the Russians have a long record of aggressive behaviour. A 2021 Rand Corporation study analysing dozens of close-shave incidents concluded it was a matter of policy, which Rand dubbed “coercive signalling”. “Moscow appears to be using coercive signals to send targeted messages regarding activities that it finds problematic,” the report said. “Sometimes the coercive signal is something like this: the plane will come up to interrogate the target, shadow at a distance, with wings clean (no missiles) but increasingly with wings dirty (with missiles) as our bilateral relations have deteriorated, and it will leave,” Dara Massicot, one of the report’s authors, said on Twitter in the wake of the drone incident. “Sometimes, usually after other methods were used, Russian signalling would shift to something unsafe and unprofessional to compel a change.” The change they are trying to compel in this case is to keep US aircraft and boats away from the fringes of the Ukraine war, where Russia’s invasion remains stalled and hugely costly, and Ukrainian forces are benefiting from US intelligence support. There have been a string of instances of close encounters since Russia’s initial invasion in 2014. In 2017, a Su-27 flew dangerously close to a RC-135 Rivet Joint surveillance plane. The next year, a Russian warplane flew across the nose of a US EP-3 spy plane, and in 2020, a Su-27 flew directly in front of a US B-52 bomber. Tuesday’s incident is more serious because it led to a collision and a crash landing in the sea. It was quite possibly an error. The US European Command pointed to incompetence on the part of the Russian pilot. But Massicot said that in this case “a deliberate bump cannot be ruled out yet”. The collision cost the US a machine that cost up to $32m and triggered a race to get to the wreckage in the Black Sea. If the Russians get there first, it will be an intelligence boon, allowing their experts to pore over its innards at leisure. As the commandant of the US Marine Corps, Gen David Berger, said such scenarios such as the downing of this drone are some of the US military’s greatest worries because of the unpredictability of the chain of events they could trigger in their wake. Berger said it was also a concern in the Pacific. In fact, the last time a US warplane was involved in such a collision, it was off the Chinese coast in April 2001, when a US EP-3 plane was struck by a Chinese interceptor jet on its third close pass. The Chinese plane crashed into the sea and the US spy plane had to make a forced landing on China’s Hainan Island, triggering a diplomatic crisis. Downing an expensive drone over the Black Sea is one thing, but destroying a crewed aircraft and killing pilots or forcing a landing on hostile territory in the middle of the war would lead to a far more volatile situation, with pressure on other sides to act tough. There are open military lines of communication and longstanding conflict-deescalation mechanisms in place to stop scenarios getting out of hand, but every time something like this happens, the world uses up a little bit more of its luck."

                    "bodyText": "Nike is the latest global brand to stop using kangaroo leather in shoe production. The sports apparel company said in a statement it “will stop making any product with kangaroo leather in 2023”. It will debut a new version of its popular football boot, the Tiempo Legend Elite, with a new synthetic material “that is a better performance solution and replaces the use of kangaroo leather”. A bill that would ban the sale of kangaroo parts was introduced in January in the US state of Oregon, where Nike has its headquarters, aimed at sportswear manufacturers. The bill would make buying, receiving, selling or commercially exchanging any product containing a part of a dead kangaroo a crime. A similar bill has been introduced in Connecticut, and California enacted a ban on kangaroo-based products in the 1970s. The German sportswear brand Puma also stopped production of football boots made from kangaroo leather this year. The companies have joined a lineup of luxury brands such as Versace and Prada who have banned using kangaroo skin. Animal rights activists have long campaigned against commercial killing of kangaroos. “Nike’s announcement that it will end use of kangaroo skins for its athletic shoes is a seismic event in wildlife protection, and tremors will be felt all over the world, especially in Australia where the mass commercial slaughter of kangaroos occurs,” the president of the Centre for a Humane Economy, Wayne Pacelle, said in a statement. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The co-founder and director of Kangaroos Alive, Mick McIntyre, said Nike and Puma were doing the right thing. “They are saying, we don’t want to be part of this inhumane slaughter of this international icon.” He said Australia’s commercial kangaroo industry was “cruel and barbaric”. “Kangaroos aren’t farmed. Commercial killing is done in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere. The regulation of the industry is almost impossible.” But the commercial harvest of kangaroos is legal in Australia. Conservation culling of the animal still occurs, and conservation experts have previously warned that bans could result in worse outcomes for kangaroos due to overpopulation. The president of the Kangaroo Industry Association of Australia, Ray Borda, said Nike’s ban was a move towards synthetic alternatives, rather than a move away from kangaroo. “It is a cyclical trend,” he said. “We have other shoe manufacturers that have increasing demand due to the environmental benefits of kangaroo leather.” The commercial industry sourced responsibly from the wild, Borda said. With one-third the carbon footprint of cattle and sheep, kangaroo products are considered by some as a sustainable option. “They emit less methane, require less water, place less pressure on grazing lands, and don’t require energy to capture and contain,” he said, also pointing to the longevity and biodegradability of kangaroo products. Borda said the commercial industry was needed to sustainably and humanely manage kangaroo numbers to ensure the species’ survival. “As kangaroo populations fluctuate in different conditions, they compete with each other and other animals for food, and put stress on agricultural land,” he said. “Without a commercial harvest, kangaroos would still need to be kept at sustainable levels through government and non-commercial culling, resulting in poorer animal welfare outcomes.”"

                    "bodyText": "The Catholic church and other institutions are attempting to use the death or incapacitation of paedophile clergy to stymy more than a dozen cases brought by historical abuse survivors, an analysis of court records suggests. The church has drawn widespread criticism since the Guardian revealed its recent, aggressive strategy to use the deaths of paedophile clergy to claim it can no longer receive a fair trial and block survivors’ civil claims permanently. The strategy, largely adopted in New South Wales, relies on a key decision last year in the state’s highest court, which found the death of Father Clarence Anderson, an abuser long known to the Lismore diocese, rendered the church unable to fairly defend itself against a woman known only as GLJ. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup That’s despite clear evidence that high-ranking church officials knew Anderson was abusing boys at least four years before GLJ’s alleged assault, but did not remove him from the clergy, instead shuffling him through parishes where he continued to abuse children. An analysis of court records suggests permanent stays are being sought or threatened in at least 13 historical abuse cases, the vast majority in NSW. Eight of the 13 cases where stays are being pursued or threatened involve two Catholic orders, the Marist and Christian Brothers, which run schools across the country. They argue the death or incapacitation of alleged perpetrators leave them unable to receive a fair trial against survivors who are now looking to the civil courts for justice. Those arguments are being mounted even where the perpetrators had a history of abusing children and where the institution held prior knowledge of other alleged offending. Ellis Legal solicitor John Ellis – a survivor whose treatment in the courts forced a belated apology from the late cardinal George Pell – said there were likely many more matters where stays have been threatened in order to discourage survivors from pursuing their rights through the courts. “It has been raised by the Marist Brothers without exception whenever a perpetrator has died and regardless of the complaints history of the perpetrator,” Ellis told the Guardian. “It has even been raised in a matter where the Marist Brothers have given evidence that before the death of the perpetrator, the perpetrator had refused to respond regarding any allegations put to him.” On Friday, the NSW supreme court heard allegations that Marist had sat on its hands for almost two years waiting for Brother Francis “Romuald” Cable, a notorious paedophile clergy member, to die before using his death to claim it could no longer receive a fair trial. It was put on notice of a survivor’s claim involving Cable in 2020, but did nothing to attempt to put the allegations to Cable in the 22 months prior to his death. Marist’s lawyer told the court that Cable refused to talk to them when it approached him in 2015, the year he was sentenced to prison. Marist is now claiming it can’t receive a fair trial because Cable is unable to give any evidence about the alleged abuse. The Christian Brothers is taking a similar approach in at least two cases, using the death or incapacitation of alleged perpetrators to argue it cannot receive a fair trial. The child abuse royal commission found on average that survivors take 22 years to come forward due to a complex set of reasons. It made findings that sought to remove barriers to justice, which prompted states and territories across the country to remove the statute of limitation period that applied to such cases. Maurice Blackburn’s NSW abuse law leader, Danielle De Paoli, said the strategy of seeking permanent stays was undoing the royal commission’s important work. “My view is that the position they’ve been taking in relation to stays is really undoing the good work that came out of the royal commission,” she said. “The royal commission gave survivors a platform to speak and a platform for them to be heard, by threatening stays or making applications for stays, they’re actually doing the reverse. They’re making survivors question whether they will be believed.” Porters Lawyers is representing at least two survivors who are facing the threat of a permanent stay due to the alleged perpetrator’s death or incapacitation. The firm’s principal, Jason Parkinson said: “The indecent haste of the Catholic church to file permanent stay applications in matters relating to known, dead or demented paedophiles is, sadly, not unprecedented. When the statute of limitations was available, they threatened to take away the victims’ houses if child-abuse survivors had the temerity to sue the Holy Roman church – the houses of hard-working, Australian taxpayers. “Given an opportunity, the church will attempt to crush the children they abused every time.” The Guardian approached the Marist and Christian Brothers for a response. GLJ is appealing to the high court, represented by Ken Cush and Associates. Her case will be closely watched by firms representing abuse survivors."

Beijing has accused the Aukus alliance of embarking on a “path of error and danger” by boosting Australia’s military capability with nuclear-powered submarines. We look at the fallout from the subs deal, along with more problems with Queensland’s youth justice system. And in breaking news, a Russian fighter jet has collided with a US Reaper surveillance drone over the Black Sea. Australia Exclusive | A 13-year-old First Nations boy was kept in total solitary confinement in a Queensland youth detention centre for at least 45 days, Guardian Australia has learned. And a whistleblower at the Brisbane watch house has alleged staff conducted “illegal” strip-searches, adults exposed themselves to children and a girl was placed in a cell with adult men. Aukus ruckus | Penny Wong has denied that the potentially game-changing transformation of Australia’s military amounted to fuelling an “arms race” in the region, after China denouncing the Aukus subs deal as a product of a “cold war mentality”. With a pricetag of hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars, the plan comes with technical risks and political ones too, such as what if an isolationist US president tears up the agreement? At home, Rowan Ramsey, the Liberal MP who faces the prospect of a nuclear waste dump in his South Australian electorate, has said he is “amazed” the government will begin the search in just 12 months for a facility that won’t be required for decades. Pollution deaths | Air pollution in NSW is estimated to cause 603 premature deaths and increase health costs by $4.8bn each year, according to a government study. And the state is in for some late summer heat this week with temperatures nudging 40C in Sydney. ‘Disregard’ for law | Rape charges against a Melbourne man are set to be dropped after the Victorian court of appeal found police showed an “astonishing disregard” for the law during a search of his home. Shot down | NSW Labor is being criticised for directing preferences to the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party in a marginal seat despite helping to pass a motion that condemned its leader, Robert Borsak, over an alleged verbal “threat of violence” against a female MP. World ‘Unsafe and unprofessional’ | A Russian fighter has collided with a US Reaper drone, forcing it down into the Black Sea west of Crimea. The military called it an “unsafe and unprofessional” intercept and said the Russian pilots had tried to disrupt the US aircraft before the collision. Facebook freeze | Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is laying off a further 10,000 people – less than six months after sacking 11,000 workers – and instituting a further hiring freeze. Bank reckoning | SVB Financial Group and two top executives have been sued by shareholders as global stocks continued to suffer yesterday despite assurances from the US president, Joe Biden. In Australia traders are slashing forecasts for another hike in interest rates next month. Asylum appeal | A group of 10 asylum seekers from conflict zones have been granted leave to appeal against the UK government for what they claim has been a failure to consider the dangers and risks of deporting them to Rwanda. Bali ban | The island’s government is going to ban tourists from renting motorbikes after a series of episodes in which foreigners violated traffic rules. Full Story Why is Australia spending up to $368bn on new submarines? Laura Murphy-Oates speaks to our foreign affairs and defence correspondent, Daniel Hurst, about the risks and rewards of the Aukus agreement. In-depth As the war in Ukraine grinds on, our reporters Isobel Koshiw and Lorenzo Tondo have joined volunteers from Black Tulip group as they search through the battlefields of northern Donetsk for Russian corpses. The aim is to exchange the bodies for those of fallen Ukrainians but it unearths a grim pattern which shows the invading forces often torch or dump their dead to avoid logging them as casualties. There’s also a powerful set of pictures from Alessio Mamo. Not the news From war to unabashed escapism. Our stream team pick this week is the LA-based reality show Vanderpump Rules. Our critic Katie Cunningham says it was sold to her as “a group of hot people working at a restaurant hook up with each other lot” and it doesn’t disappoint. In fact, she reckons it’s nothing less than the best reality show yet. The world of sport AFL | With the first bounce only a day away, our expert writer reckons Collingwood could go all the way this year but that any one of the top 10 could win the flag. Football | The 2026 World Cup finals in the US, Canada and Mexico will feature 48 teams and 104 games, including a new last-32 stage, with plans for three-team groups abandoned, Fifa has confirmed. Golf | Governing bodies have proposed a new local rule to give tournament organisers the option to use a distance-reducing ball to negate technological advances in player fitness and equipment. Media roundup The papers are mostly positive about the Aukus subs deal, with the Australian praising the prime minister for “reshaping regional power and the Labor party”. The Sydney Morning Herald, however, points to a “mammoth” budget battle to pay for the new boats. In Melbourne protesters have gathered outside Richmond town hall to call for the scrapping of a waste levy, the Age reports. What’s happening today Canberra | Paul Keating will speak at the Press Club. Pacific | Anthony Albanese has arrived in Fiji for talks with the new PM, Sitiveni Rabuka. NSW | Dominic Perrottet will debate Chris Minns in the lead-up to the 25 March election. Sydney | Violet Coco, the climate activist who blocked the Sydney Harbour Bridge, will appear in court.

                    "bodyText": "“Perhaps the first major diplomatic example of a post-America Middle East,” wrote one analyst. He was describing Iran and Saudi Arabia’s agreement last week to resume diplomatic relations – a surprise to most observers, and something of a coup for China, which brokered it. The volatile rivalry between the two nations has been one of the great geopolitical faultlines since the Iranian revolution of 1979. Security concerns, claims to regional leadership, ethno-sectarian rivalries and other factors have all played their part. The repercussions have been profound. The tensions contributed to Iran’s all-out support for the Syrian regime, fuelled the war in Yemen, where more than 150,000 have died, and accelerated the disintegration of the state in Lebanon. Ties were cut in 2016 when Iranian protesters stormed Saudi diplomatic missions over Riyadh’s execution of a revered Shia cleric. But while last week’s announcement was welcome, it is only a beginning. Assuming the deal goes ahead – there are two months for details to be ironed out – the containment of Saudi-Iranian tensions will not necessarily lead to a deeper rapprochement, let alone end Lebanon’s woes or the complex and multifaceted conflict in Yemen. Talks between Riyadh and Tehran had been taking place since at least 2021. In 2019, an attack on a major oil facility that briefly knocked out half the kingdom’s output intensified security fears. The huge cost and reputational damage of the Saudi intervention in Yemen (in support of the internationally recognised government) gave an initially gung-ho Riyadh pause too. Driving through Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s economic “Vision 2030” will require vast foreign investment. And amid concern that the kingdom can no longer count on unstinting support from the US, preoccupied with Ukraine and tilting to the Indo-Pacific, this was a reminder to the Biden administration that Riyadh has other friends. For Iran, the benefits are obvious: a first step out of political and economic isolation. It also blames Saudi-funded media for encouraging anti-government protests and wants broadcasts reined in. Meanwhile, China has positioned itself as an alternative to a withering US-led order and as a responsible peacemaker, offering a riposte to criticism for its support for Russia. In truth, Iran and Oman laid the groundwork, and China has brought willing parties together, rather than having to bang heads. Nonetheless, it was Beijing that got the agreement over the line. It enjoys a long partnership with Tehran, but is also Riyadh’s biggest trading partner. In contrast, US dealings with Iran have been worse than ever since the Trump administration withdrew from the JCPoA nuclear deal. Until now, China has focused primarily on trade and economic interests in the Middle East. Now those interests are making it think more broadly about regional stability. It reportedly plans to host a major summit for Iran and Gulf monarchies this year. But as it becomes more enmeshed, it may find it harder to maintain its neutral status. Its involvement could also pave the way for a new era of diplomacy in which democracy and human rights don’t even get lip service. Joe Biden drew flak for fist-bumping the Saudi crown prince, having denounced Jamal Khashoggi’s murder; Beijing insisted that the case should not be “politicised or internationalised” at all. Who really wins from this deal remains to be seen, but authoritarian leaders could benefit more than the ordinary people whose lives have been damaged by the rivalry."

                    "headline": "Special relationship becomes personal as Sunak and Biden bond in San Diego",
                    "bodyText": "It is common for British and American leaders to try to show the “special relationship” between their two countries extends to them personally. When Rishi Sunak landed in San Diego for a flash visit to see Joe Biden, the world’s media were spared any such attempts verging on the grandiose. There was some light banter from Biden about Sunak’s home in California and carefully coordinated invites between the two leaders for future visits. It was a far cry from the scenes of David Cameron playing table tennis with Barack Obama, or Theresa May holding hands with Donald Trump. But when journalists were ushered out of the gym on the naval base in Point Loma, where the leaders of the three Aukus powers had gathered for a summit, the real strength of the relationship between Sunak and Biden became clear. Instead of reams of officials sitting round listening closely, the two leaders spent nearly an hour alone, preferring to have a more personal conversation. There was plenty for them to bond over, before they got into the nitty gritty. Sunak is a big college football fan, from his days as a business student at Stanford. He still has a house in Santa Monica, around three hours’ drive up the west coast. The prime minister also remains so fond of chocolate chip muffins and Mexican cola that he brought a stash of both home. Of course, Sunak is not always keen to talk publicly about his close ties to the US – particularly the green card he held until 2021 and whether he will publish his US taxes. Biden’s angling for an invite to Sunak’s California home may have left the prime minister wanting to wince. But such encounters are highly valuable. Karen Pierce, Britain’s ambassador to Washington, has made persistent requests for a bilateral meeting between the two leaders. They appear to have paid off, with the prospect of a visit by Biden to Northern Ireland in April, before Sunak returns for a longer trip to the US in June, this time to Washington DC. In between, they will meet again at the G7 summit in Japan in May. Three such meetings in as many months means hopes are not high Biden will come to the UK for the king’s coronation. There are plenty of issues requiring joint engagement by both leaders that will continue in the background. As well as fulfilling plans to give Australia a new fleet of nuclear-powered submarines and working through Britain’s concerns about the US Inflation Reduction Act, the question of how to deal with China’s growing “aggression” is a live one. It is likely to have been one of the main topics the two leaders discussed when they held talks away from prying eyes this week. Biden joined the US Senate in 1973, meaning he has been in frontline politics for longer than Sunak, 42, has been alive. There is a wealth of wisdom and experience for the prime minister to admire, especially when it comes to China. During a career keenly focused on foreign affairs, Biden is said to have spent about 100 hours speaking to President Xi Jinping. Much of that was face to face, instead of on long-distance phone calls, making Biden the western world leader with perhaps the greatest personal insight into Xi’s character. At Monday’s summit of the three Aukus powers, they agreed that the “challenge” posed by China stretched decades ahead. So for Sunak to be able to draw on reflections from Biden looking back long term may prove a helpful counterbalance to hot-headed Tory backbenchers."

                    "bodyText": "Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, the top two Republicans in polling regarding the 2024 presidential nomination, have said defending Ukraine was not a vital US interest, in remarks that will demoralise Kyiv and encourage Vladimir Putin to believe that time is on his side. Trump, a longstanding Putin admirer, has been consistently sceptical about US support for Ukraine, and has suggested he could broker a peace deal, involving Ukraine surrendering territory. DeSantis had previously tried to dodge questions on Ukraine, and his new comments are likely to shift sentiment in the Republican party further from support of Ukraine. Both men answered a questionnaire from Tucker Carlson, the primetime Fox News host, who posted the responses to Twitter. DeSantis, the governor of Florida, said the US should not “become further entangled” in the Russia-Ukraine war. Trump, the former president who dominates polling, said the Ukraine war was not a vital US interest “but it is for Europe … that is why Europe should be paying far more than we are, or equal”. The remarks come at a time of military stalemate, with neither side proving able to make significant breakthroughs on the battlefield. Ukraine is hoping to break the impasse this spring, but it is unclear whether it has enough weapons and experienced soldiers to achieve its aims. Analysts have said that the longer the war continues, the better Putin’s chances, as Kyiv’s western backers get weary of the cost, and Russia’s greater population becomes an increasingly important factor. To Carlson, DeSantis said: “While the US has many vital national interests – securing our borders, addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy security and independence, and checking the economic, cultural and military power of the Chinese communist party – becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them.” DeSantis also accused Joe Biden of providing “a virtual blank cheque” to Ukraine and said: “Without question, peace should be the objective. The US should not provide assistance that could require the deployment of American troops or enable Ukraine to engage in offensive operations beyond its borders.” Biden has said US troops will not be deployed and has not encouraged Kyiv to go beyond attempting to expel its invaders. “F-16s and long-range missiles should … be off the table,” DeSantis said. “These moves would risk explicitly drawing the United States … closer to a hot war between the world’s two largest nuclear powers. That risk is unacceptable.” The governor also said “a policy of ‘regime change’ in Russia (no doubt popular among the DC foreign policy interventionists) would greatly increase the stakes of the conflict, making the use of nuclear weapons more likely”. Apart from an off-the-cuff Biden remark a year ago, saying that Putin “cannot remain in power”, the administration has been adamant it is not pursuing regime change. In his response to Carlson, Trump claimed: “Russia would definitely not have raided and attacked Ukraine if I was your president.” Characteristically, he couched policy prescriptions in financial terms, claiming the US was being conned by its European allies. In his four years in power, Trump was regularly accused of subservience towards Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. While Senate Republicans are broadly supportive of US military backing for Ukraine, a growing group of hard-right representatives in the House are calling for it to end. With his remarks, DeSantis took sides in a fierce debate within his party. Douglas London, a former senior CIA official, suggested the remarks could be tactical. “DeSantis dismissal of Russia’s war in Ukraine as a vital US interest will invite the Kremlin’s cyber [and] disinformation tools to amplify his message, charge his base and further sow American division,” London said on Twitter. Mark Hertling, a retired general and CNN national security analyst, said: “I was taught and I believe US domestic and international policies are driven foremost by our nation’s values. Independence, sovereignty, respect for individual freedoms and rights, rule of law, dignity of fellow humans … That’s why we help Ukraine.⁩” DeSantis’s characterisation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a “territorial dispute” drew particularly fierce fire. Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic operative and pollster, said Republicans’ “rancid appeasement of Putin has been among the darkest chapters in all of American history. DeSantis parrots Kremlin taking points on Ukraine, again”. Other candidates and prospective candidates also answered Carlson’s questions. The former vice-president Mike Pence cited Ronald Reagan in describing the need to stand up to Russia, thereby aligning himself with Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader. “I would say anyone that thinks … Putin will stop at Ukraine is wrong,” Pence said. Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, issued a statement in favour of continued military support for Ukraine. “Russia’s objective is to take over all of Ukraine by military force. Our objective should be to help the Ukrainians prevent that from happening,” Haley said on Tuesday. Bill Kristol, a conservative Trump critic, asked: “Will ‘Republican internationalists and hawkish elements in the party’s donor class’ rally to candidates like Pence, Haley or Christie now that DeSantis has joined Team Tucker on Ukraine? Or will they once again submit, and embrace dangerous demagoguery?”"

                    "bodyText": "Time to wrap up…. Ratings agency Moody’s has cut its view on the US banking system to negative from stable, as the ramifications of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. In a note published overnight, it says Although the Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve and FDIC announced that all depositors of SVB and Signature Bank will be made whole, the rapid and substantial decline in bank depositor and investor confidence precipitating this action starkly highlight risks in US banks’ asset-liability management (ALM) exacerbated by rapidly rising interest rates. Financial stocks have rallied in New York, and also in London, with US regional bank shares surging today, after heavy losses on Monday. There were losses in Asia, though, where Japanese banks fell in overnight trading. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, sums up the situation: ‘’US banking stocks are on a rollercoaster ride, rising sharply following the steep sell offs yesterday as worries seem to be lifting a little about contagion from the SVB collapse. Hope is rebounding that the backstop of deposits of failed banks will stem further withdrawals and that more generous loan terms to struggling banks could help restore confidence. First Republic Bank shares have surged 44% but still haven’t made up the punishing losses of recent days, indicating that uncertainty remains about its robustness. The FTSE 100 has been swept upwards in afternoon trade, helped by the tailwinds from Wall Street. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the Wall Street Journal is reporting. SVB Financial Group and two top executives have been sued by shareholders over the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. In the UK, MPs on the Treasury Committee are to hold a hearing into the rescue of Silicon Valley Bank UK. German chancellor Olaf Scholz tried to reassure his citizens about the crisis, saying that Germans should not have major concerns about the fallout of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. The markets rallied after US inflation fell to 6%, raising hopes that the US Federal Reserve will not feel compelled to implement a large interest rate hike this month. Here are the rest of today’s main stories: With the mood in the City rather brighter today than yesterday, the FTSE 100 index has closed 88.5 points higher tonight. The index of blue-chip shares gained 1.17% to close at 7637, recovering almost half of Monday’s losses. Rolls-Royce (+7%), Ocado (+4.1%) and Hargreaves Lansdown (+4%) led the risers. UK listed banks also rallied, with Barclays up 3.1% and Lloyds Banking Group gaining 2.1%. Charles Archer of IG, warns though, that the Silicon Valley Bank crisis is “far from over”. Archer writes: Across the pond, the Financial Times has reported that larger institutions such as Citi and JPMorgan are being inundated with new depositors fleeing from the thousands of smaller US banks. For context, it’s worth remembering that while US regulators have guaranteed the deposits of funds held at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, this protection has not been extended universally. This leaves depositors elsewhere relying on the FDIC insurance, limited to just $250,000, akin to the £85,000 FSCS limit in the UK. Over 30% of US deposits are held in small banks in the states, and more than 50% of funds are above the FDIC limit. With new CPI figures showing that annual inflation has slowed to 6%, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has an unappetising tightrope to walk this month: pausing or pivoting could see inflation become more entrenched or start to rise just as it looked like it might finally get under control, while continuing to increase rates could well see another unexpected economic ‘break.’ With an hour’s trading to go here in London, the FTSE 100 index is up over 1%. The blue-chip index has gained 89 points, back to 7638, gaining back almost half of Monday’s selloff. Engineering company Rolls-Royce are the top riser, up 7%, followed by bank Barclays (+3.7%). The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the Wall Street Journal is reporting. The WSJ says: The separate probes are in their preliminary phases and may not lead to charges or allegations of wrongdoing. Prosecutors and regulators often open investigations after financial institutions or public companies suffer big, unexpected losses. The SEC and a spokesperson for the Justice Department in Washington have declined to comment. This comes day after SVB Financial Group and two top executives were sued by shareholders, who accused them of concealing how rising interest rates would leave its Silicon Valley Bank unit susceptible to a bank run. The proposed class action lawsuit against SVB, Chief Executive Greg Becker and Chief Financial Officer Daniel Beck was filed in the federal court in San Jose, California. Price rises slowed again in February as the annual rate of inflation eased but the report has been overshadowed by a banking crisis ahead of next week’s meeting of the Federal Reserve. Prices in February were 6% higher than a year ago, down from an annual rate of 6.4% in January and significantly lower than the 9.1% peak of inflation seen in June, my colleague Lauren Aratani reports. Between January and February, prices rose 0.4% as prices increased in sectors including housing and food. While February saw the continuation of a downward trend in the 12-month inflation rate, the core prices – which excludes volatile food and energy prices – increased by 0.5% in February compared with a 0.4% monthly gain in January. More here. Ratings agency Moody’s has changed its outlook on the US banking system to “negative” from “stable” after the collapse of three major banks fueled fears of a contagion. Moody’s Investors Service said it was making the move in light of three key bank failures in recent days that prompted regulators to step in on Sunday with a dramatic rescue plan for depositors and other institutions impacted by the crisis. In a report, Moody’s says that the operating environment for US banks is “rapidly deteriorating”. “We have changed to negative from stable our outlook on the US banking system to reflect the rapid deterioration in the operating environment following deposit runs at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Silvergate Bank, and Signature Bank (SNY) and the failures of SVB and SNY.” As covered this morning, Moody’s also put six US regional banks on watch for a potential downgrade. US president Joe Biden has welcomed the fall in inflation last month, saying: Today’s report shows annual inflation is down by a third from this summer at a time when the unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low. That is the slowest annual increase since September 2021. I will continue working to lower costs for hard-working Americans so they have a little more breathing room at the end of the month. Investors are circling Silicon Valley Bank’s assets, after the bank was seized by federal regulators last week. Bloomberg reports that Apollo Global Management Inc., Blackstone Inc. and KKR &amp; Co. have expressed interest in snapping up a book of loans held by SVB. It says: Apollo, Blackstone and KKR, three of the world’s largest alternative asset managers, are among investors looking to buy pieces of Silicon Valley Bank, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. The bank had $73.6 billion of loans as of 31 December 2022. The size of the loan book Apollo and Blackstone are interested in couldn’t immediately be determined. Blackstone is also looking at other assets it may purchase from the bank, one of the people said. An index of US regional banks is rallying sharply today. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF is up over 7%, lifted by banks such as First Republic (+53%). Back in the UK, MPs are to hold a hearing on the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank later this month. The Treasury committee will quiz the Bank of England on Tuesday 28 March, and examine ask why SVB UK had to be rescued by HSBC on Monday morning. The committee has also written to the BoE, asking for details about how SVB UK was supervised before its collapse – including the resource allocated to it, the decision to choose HSBC as a purchases, and what lessons can be learned. Harriett Baldwin MP, Chair of the Treasury Committee, says: “This deal is the best possible outcome achieved in incredibly challenging circumstances. We thank everyone who worked tirelessly to achieve this deal. “Yet, while it’s reassuring that taxpayer funds were not required in this instance, a number of questions remain around the effectiveness of bank regulation and resolution procedures, especially for smaller banks with a significant presence in strategically-important industries. It is important that we reflect on the lessons from this episode to ensure that the post-financial crisis regime to avoid bailouts remains strong.” Shares in Facebooks owner, Meta, have jumped almost 6% after it announced plans to lay off another 10,000 workers. This is the second round of significant job cuts announced by the tech giant in four months. It is also instituting a further hiring freeze as part of the company’s “Year of Efficiency”. In a Facebook post today, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the job cuts will take place “over the next couple of months.” Zuckerberg wrote: “We expect to announce restructurings and layoffs in our tech groups in late April, and then our business groups in late May,” In a “small number of cases”, it may take through the end of the year to complete these changes, Zuckerberg says, adding: “Overall, we expect to reduce our team size by around 10,000 people and to close around 5,000 additional open roles that we haven’t yet hired.” Here’s the story: Meta’s shares have jumped 5.5%, or $10, to $191, the highest in over a month. German chancellor Olaf Scholz has said today that Germans should not have major concerns about the fallout of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. Scholz said regulators had learned lessons from the global financial crisis in 2008, speaking in Berlin aongside Ilham Aliyev, the President of Azerbaijan. The tech-focused Nasdaq index has jumped 2% in early trading, as the Wall Street rally gathers pace. The US stock market has jumped at the start of trading, as bank stocks mounted a comeback from Monday’s heavy losses. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 1%, up 314 points at 32,133 in a flurry of buying. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has gained 1.5%, as investors cheer the slowdown in US inflation last month. And after a brutal day yesterday, US regional banks are bouncing back in early trading, as concerns over their financial health ease. San Francisco-based First Republic’s shares have surged 57%, back to $49.28. On Monday it fell 62%, from $81 to $31. Western Alliance Bancorp, of Phoenix, Arizona has gained 52%, while Los Angeles-based PacWest has jumped 55%. Zions, of Salt Lake City, Utah, has gained 22%. However, Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard, argues that US interest rates will actually rise higher than forecast: “This is exactly the inflation print the Fed did not want. The elevated core inflation in February adds to the evidence of economic strength from last week’s job numbers, signalling the need for tighter monetary policy. But asset liability management challenges for some banks might limit the latitude to tighten in the near term. Despite banking challenges, persistent inflation means markets are likely wrong to expect rate cuts this year. The economy remains strong, and the Fed will likely need to hike rates further and keep them higher for longer than markets are currently pricing.” Bank shares in London have turned higher too. Barclays are up 4.6% and Lloyds Banking Group have jumped 3%, among the top risers on the FTSE 100 today. European stock markets are now rallying, as investors are cheered by the fall in US inflation last month. The UK’s FTSE 100 index has gained 42 points, or over 0.5%, to 7590 points, having been broadly flat before the inflation report hit the wires. That recovers about a fifth of Monday’s selloff. Germany’s DAX has gained 1.6%, while France’s CAC is 1.4% higher. This suggests that the slowdown in price rises across America last month bolsters expectations of a smaller interest rate rise this month, of 25 basis points. Neal Keane, head of sales trading at the international brokerage ADSS, reckons the US Federal Reserve is still likely to raise interest rates again, despite slowing inflation and the collapse of two banks in recent days. Keane writes: “Headline figures show a notable decrease in annual CPI to reach 6% - but with the core rate falling to only 5.5% and MoM inflation rising 0.4%, this piece of the rate hike puzzle will offer little to convince the Fed to pause rate increases in the near term.” The collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature will “undoubtedly weigh on the Fed’s mind”, with opinion divided on whether it should pause rate hikes immediately, Keane adds: On balance, a hike of 25bps [a quarter of one percent] still looks the more likely scenario, with further hikes still possible while inflation continues running too high at current levels.” Gerrit Smit, manager of the $1.7bn Stonehage Fleming Global Best Ideas Equity fund, says investors will be cheered that US inflation continues to fall: Smit predicts it will allow the Fed to raise its headline interest rates by another quarter-point next week: “Headline inflation dropped to 6.0% as expected, lower than many fears of very sticky inflation. This is a welcome reprieve, and we can expect the Fed to continue on its +25bps pathway despite the SVB scare.” The US inflation report puts the Federal Reserve in a ‘somewhat tricky position’, says John Leiper, chief investment officer, Titan Asset Management. Although the rate of price increases slowed, the Fed will want to get inflation down towards its 2% target by raising interest rates again. However, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank shows the impact of its previous rate rises, and the risks from tightening policy quickly. Leiper says: “It’s been an eventful week for markets and today’s inflation print doesn’t change that. Headline inflation came in-line with expectations although core inflation picked-up slightly month-on-month. This keeps the Fed in a somewhat tricky position. The Fed cannot fall behind the inflation curve, its credibility is at risk if it does, but equally the lagged impact of prior tightening is now starting to show its face, as evidenced by the recent Silicon Valley Bank failure. This remains a delicate balancing act for Jerome Powell and markets won’t like the ongoing uncertainty.” At 6.0% last month, annual US inflation is the lowest since September 2021. The core inflation rate (which excludes food and energy) was the lowest since December 2021 at 5.5% per year. Energy prices increased 5.2% in the 12 months to February, while the food index increased 9.5% over the last year. Newsflash: US inflation has eased, but still remains sharply above the Federal Reserve’s target. The consumer prices index in America slowed to an annual rate of 6.0% in February, down from 6.4% in January. That matches economists expectations, and means inflation is running three times above the Fed’s target of 2%. Core inflation eased a little, to 5.5% from 5.6%. During February alone, inflation was 0.4%, a slowdown on the 0.5% increase in the CPI in January. The index for shelter was the largest contributor to inflation in February, accounting for over 70% of the monthly increase, with the indexes for food, recreation, and household furnishings and operations also contributing. The food index increased 0.4% over the month with the food at home index rising 0.3%. But energy prices eased by 0.6% during the month, helped by falling prices of natural gas and fuel oil. Economics professor Ricardo Reis has written a very interesting thread about the implications of the SVB collapse for the US Federal Reserve’s interest-rate-hiking cycle. European bank shares have shaken off their earlier losses. The European Stoxx banks index is now up 0.3% today, a small recovery after its biggest falls in a year. Credit Suisse has recovered some ground – its share are now 1.7% today, having dropped over 4% at one stage this morning. Credit Suisse Group chief executive Ulrich Körner told Bloomberg TV this morning that the bank has seen inflows of client funds on Monday, as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank rocked the financial markkets. Körner said: We got inflows yesterday, which is a positive sign I would say. We even saw materially good inflows yesterday.” In the UK supermarket sector, Sainsbury’s is buying back the freehold on 21 of its supermarkets in a £431m deal. Analysts said the deal, which unwinds a sale and leaseback joint venture, gives Sainsbury’s fewer liabilities and more control over its assets as it faces higher costs and tightening consumer spending. Sainsbury’s said it wanted to sell and lease back a further four stores which were part of the joint venture while one vacant store would be sold outright. British banks are not yet seeing a “flight to quality” in deposits among customers nervous about the safety of their money following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last week, Lloyds chief executive Charlie Nunn has said today. Nunn told a Morgan Stanley event today (via Reuters) that: “What’s happened with SVB is relatively idiosyncratic compared to the UK” As covered at 9.03am, major US banks including JPMorgan and Citigroup have seen a wave of customers applying to shift their accounts to larger lenders. Nunn doesn’t see signs that this is happening in the UK, though, saying: “We haven’t seen what we’ve seen in the US, which is the flight to quality. “But let’s see how that plays out and we’ll see how people feel over the next period of time.” The number of company insolvencies in England and Wales has jumped by 17%, in a sign that economic tensions in the UK are increasing. There were 1,783 registered company insolvencies across England and Wales in February, new figures from the Insolvency Service show. That’s up from 1,518 in February 2022, and a third more than before the pandemic – showing the stresses in the UK economy ahead of tomorrow’s budget. Most of the company failures were Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidations (CVLs), where directors decide to liquidate their firms because they are insolvent. Compulsory liquidations more than doubled, to 158. Nigel Fox, a Director in the Restructuring &amp; Recovery team at Evelyn Partners, explains The effect of Covid restrictions will mean that many businesses will have much less cash to weather the storm caused by such factors as the huge hike in energy costs and the 40 year high in inflation, together with rising interest rates. “It is therefore more important than ever for businesses to be vigilant to watch out for the warning signs of potential insolvency and to take appropriate advice as early as possible. Such advice could help directors avoid the personal liability that might arise if they carried on trading when there was no potentially viable plan to successfully ride out the difficult times.” There are indications that overall corporate insolvency numbers might be starting to plateau, perhaps mirroring the fact that inflation might also have peaked, says Inga West, Restructuring and Insolvency Counsel at law firm Ashurst: West adds: Eyes will be on the budget this week to see what recovery measures are being announced to support British Business battle its way through the harsh economic conditions. The stark rise in corporate insolvency figures has been driven almost entirely by near record levels of creditor voluntary liquidations. This is an insolvency process favoured by SMEs. Interestingly, administration numbers remain lower than pre-pandemic - suggesting that larger companies are finding a way to hang on - perhaps hoping for a boon from the Chancellor.” Shares in Credit Suisse have dropped by over 4% this morning, after it reported that ‘material weaknesses’ have been found in its financial reporting controls. Credit Suisse’s shares have dropped as low as 2.12 Swiss francs this morning, close to the record low hit during yesterday’s trading. As reported at 8.41am, Credit Suisse’s bonds have also weakened to record lows this morning, as it released its delayed annual report. In the annual report released today, Credit Suisse said “management did not design and maintain an effective risk assessment process to identify and analyse the risk of material misstatements in its financial statements”. Credit Suisse was forced to delay the release of its annual report from last week after the Securities and Exchange Commission raised last-minute queries related to cash-flow statements from 2019 and 2020. The banks says those discussions have now been concluded. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says investors are not in a forgiving mood with Credit Suisse: “While the immediate fallout from the SVB collapse may have been contained for now, the edginess around the banking sector isn’t helped by the latest revelations from Credit Suisse as it identified material weaknesses in reporting controls. “It may have been a ‘technical’ issue according to the Swiss bank but in the current environment and given the company’s recent sketchy track record, investors were hardly in a forgiving mood. Last month, Credit Suisse reported its biggest annual loss since the 2008 global financial crisis after clients pulled billions from the bank following a series of scandals. Credit Suisse was hard hit by the collapse of U.S. investment firm Archegos in 2021, and the freezing of billions of supply chain finance funds linked to insolvent British financier Greensill. A year ago, a massive leak exposed the hidden wealth of Credit Suisse clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes. Oil prices have dropped again today, as the fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank rattles markets. With fears of a fresh financial crisis high, Brent crude has dropped by 2% to $79 per barrel, close to its lowest level this year. Oil also weakened yesterday, as the failure of SVB over the weekend stirred fears of a potential recession. The turmoil that has erupted in the financial system has triggered widespread risk aversion, says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. If we see markets settle down, that could prevent a break of the lows but oil traders, like those elsewhere, will remain nervous about the prospect of further turbulence. Suddenly, a break below the lows looks a much greater risk which may keep pressure on in the short term. Rating agency Moody’s has placed six US lenders, including First Republic Bank, at risk of a downgrade, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. First Republic, Western Alliance Bancorp, Intrust Financial Corp., UMB Financial Corp., Zions Bancorp. and Comerica are all on review for a downgrade. It’s the latest sign of concern over the health of regional financial firms – whose shares all fell sharply on Monday. Moody’s pointed to concerns over the lenders’ reliance on uninsured deposit funding and unrealized losses in their asset portfolios. In a statement, Moody’s cited the “material” amount of deposits above the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation threshold of $250,000, saying: “The review for downgrade reflects the extremely volatile funding conditions for some US banks exposed to the risk of uninsured deposit outflows.” Moody’s also downgraded Signature Bank and withdrew its credit rating. That’s not a surprise, though given the lender was shut down over the weekend… In the energy sector, British Gas owner Centrica plans to extend the lives of two nuclear power stations by two years, as part of efforts to strengthen the UK’s energy security. Heysham 1 on the north-west coast of England near Lancaster and the Hartlepool power station in County Durham are now expected to close in March 2026. These extensions are expected to add 6TWh (terawatt hour) to Centrica’s electricity generation volumes between 2024 and 2026. This is equivalent to around 70% of Centrica’s total electricity generated from nuclear power last year. Chris O’Shea, Centrica’s chief executive, said: “I’m delighted we’ve been able to work with EDF to strengthen the UK’s energy security by extending the life of these critical power stations. “This continues our action to bolster security of supply in our core markets which includes reopening the Rough gas storage facility in the UK, sanctioning new gas-fired electricity generation capacity in Ireland, and securing increased volumes of gas and renewable power for our customers. We will continue to focus on supporting energy security in our core markets during these uncertain times.” The news comes after a similar announcement from EDF last week. Certain aspects of the Silicon Valley Bank situation were unique, UBS Wealth Management point out this morning: It had the highest ratio of securities to total assets of any US bank; a far higher-than-average proportion of its depositors were corporate clients in the technology sector; and its uninsured deposit mix was one of the highest in the industry. That made it especially vulnerable both to deposit outflows and to mark-to-market losses when it attempted to meet those outflows. However, to some extent, the fundamental challenge faced by Silicon Valley Bank is also faced by other US banks, UBS say. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, explains: “From here, in order to minimize the risk of deposit outflows, many smaller banks may be forced to further increase deposit rates. As demonstrated by equity market performance on Monday, this is not good for any bank’s profitability, though those banks with higher capital ratios, smaller pools of securities relative to total assets, strong brands, and diversified funding sources should be better able to weather the current market dynamics.” Investors are also on edge today because we get the latest US inflation report at 12.30pm UK time. The annual Consumer Prices Index is expected to drop to 6% in February, down from 6.4% in January. But core inflation is only expected to dip slightly, to 5.5% from 5.6%. In normal times, high inflation would spur the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates to squeeze out price pressures. But having seen Silivon Valley Bank blow up, having been caught out by the rapid rise in borrowing costs which hit the value of its bonds, the Fed may be more reluctant to tighten policy further. But if inflationary pressures remain hot, the Fed will still feel pressure to act…. The Bank of Japan says Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital buffers to absorb losses caused by various external factors, including risks caused by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. A BOJ official told reporters in Tokyo: “Japanese financial institutions’ direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank is small, and thus the impact is likely limited,” The BoJ released an annual report that looks at the strength of Japan’s financial institutions. It found that they have continued to channel funds to borrowers smoothly, despite stress factors such as supply constraints and rising overseas interest rates. But, the report also pointed to challenges facing regional banks, such as analysing the impact of heightened market volatility on their portfolios…. “Some regional financial institutions have suffered a substantial increase in valuation losses” and failed to adequately assess their risk tolerance against profits, it said. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is not expected to affect the euro zone’s banks, Greek central bank chief Yannis Stournaras has said. Stournaras, a member of the ECB’s Governing Council, told Kathimerini newspaper: “We don’t see SVB (Silicon Valley Bank) having an impact on the euro zone’s banks or the Greek ones.” What a difference a decade makes. 10 years ago, Stournaras was Greece’s finance minister, when the eurozone debt crisis threatened to push Greece into bankrupcy. Today, Greece is hoping to secure an investment-grade credit rating. Large US banks are being inundated with requests from customers trying to transfer funds from smaller lenders, the Financial Times is reporting. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America are among the large financial institutions are trying to accommodate customers wanting to move deposits quickly from Silicon Valley Bank and other regional lenders. They are taking extra steps to speed up the normal sign-up or “onboarding” process, according to several people familiar with the matter. The failure of SVB has caused what executives say is the biggest movement of deposits in more than a decade. Wealthier customers, who have more than the $250,000 maximum guaranteed by federal insurance, are among those looking to move balances into larger banks (although all deposits at SVB and Signature Bank are guaranteed by the package announced on Sunday night). One senior banker, referring to Chicago’s busy aviation hub, said: “The calls have been coming in today like airplanes stacked on a snowy day at O’Hare airport.” The European banks index has dipped in early trading, down 0.3%. That indicates some calm in Europe this morning, after banking stocks posted their biggest losses in a year on Monday. London’s stock market is open, and bank shares are continuing to drop – although not as sharply as yesterday. HSBC are down 1.8%, and Standard Chartered has lost 1.6%. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has dipped by 0.3%, or 20 points, to 7528 points, the lowest since 3 January, on top of Monday’s 200-point tumble. Energy stocks are also weaker, as the oil price comes under pressure. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor says: “European markets have opened mixed with the FTSE 100 underperforming. Land Securities, British Land and Rightmove are among the outperformers on the UK index amid hopes of a dovish tilt from the Bank of England. Most European banks continue to face selling pressure with HSBC and Standard Chartered near the bottom of the FTSE 100. Credit Suisse is leading the declines across European financials after the Swiss lender said it found ‘material weakness’ in its internal financial reporting controls, adding to its woes. Markets in Asia fell sharply overnight with the Nikkei, the Kospi and the Hang Seng down more than 2% each. In Japan its biggest banks suffered steep losses with the TOPIX Banks index down by more than 7% as President Biden’s address failed to soothe investors. Elsewhere in banking this morning, Credit Suisse’s bonds are falling after it released its delayed annual report. The annual report, delayed from last week, showed that Credit Suisse has identified “material weaknesses” in its internal controls over financial reporting and said it had not yet stemmed customer outflows. It says: “As of December 31, 2022, the Group’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective, and for the same reasons, management has reassessed and has reached the same conclusion regarding December 31, 2021.” Credit Suisse said customer “outflows stabilized to much lower levels but had not yet reversed as of the date of this report” Some Credit Suisse bond prices have hit record lows; yesterday, the cost of insuring its debt hit record highs. More investors are expecting America’s central bank to start cutting interest cuts by the end of the year, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. The CME FedWatch Tool, which tracks investor expectations for the trajectory of rates, suggests that the Federal Reserve could raise its benchmark rate by a quarter-point, or 25 basis points, to 4.75%-5.00%, at its meeting next week. But by December, the markest suggest rates will have fallen back to around 4%-4.25%, or half a point lower than current levels. There has been a “Titanic repricing” in expectations for US interest rate moves this year, say ING. In the US, markets now see only a 50% chance of a 25bp hike in March, and fully price in 67bp of cuts by year-end. Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, says yesterday’s dramatic session was “up there with some of the wilder days I can remember”. I always thought that with inflation where it was, that central banks would keep hiking until they broke something, which was especially likely with the yield curve so inverted. Now they have broken something, is that enough for a pause? Much will depend on whether markets and contagion risk can calm quickly enough. If the FOMC meeting was today I strongly suspect they wouldn’t hike but a week is a long time in these markets. Global financial stocks have lost $465bn in market value in two days as investors cut exposure to lenders from New York to Japan in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse, Bloomberg has calculated. They explain: Losses widened today, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Financials Index dropping as much as 2.7% to the lowest since Nov. 29. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. slid as much as 8.3% in Japan, while South Korea’s Hana Financial Group Inc. fell 4.7% and Australia’s ANZ Group Holdings Ltd. lost 2.8%. There are concerns that financial firms could see an impact from their investments in bonds and other instruments on the SVB-induced worry. Treasury yields plunged Monday amid expectations the Federal Reserve will hold off raising rates due to turmoil in the banking system. Volatility is likely to remain the name of the game in the markets today, say ING. US stock futures point at a marginally positive open this morning, but markets are constantly monitoring incoming news on the health of other financial institutions, in particular US regional banks. SVB Financial Group and two top executives have been sued by shareholders over the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, as global stocks continued to suffer on Tuesday despite assurances from US president Joe Biden. The bank’s shareholders accuse SVB Financial Group chief executive Greg Becker and chief financial officer Daniel Beck of concealing how rising interest rates would leave its Silicon Valley Bank unit “particularly susceptible” to a bank run. The proposed class action was filed on Monday in the federal court in San Jose, California. It appeared to be the first of many likely lawsuits over the demise of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which US regulators seized on 10 March after a surge of deposit withdrawals. Good morning. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is gripping the financial markets, as global bank shares slide despite reassurances from President Joe Biden on Monday. There have been fresh losses in Asia-Pacific stock markets today, as bank stocks continues to fall. Japan’s Topix Banks index is on track for its worst day since March 2020, early in the pandemic, currently down 7.4%. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group is down 8.66%, with Mizuho Financial Group losing 7.1% This has pulled Japan’s Topix index down by 2.7%. Elsewhere, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index has dropped by 2.35%. South Korea’s KOSPI index has lost 2.4%, with its Hana Financial Group down almost 4%. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX is down 1.4%. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, says: The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday has brought on the highest volatile market conditions of 2023 so far. Shares in a number of America’s regional banks closed sharply lower on Monday night, hours after president Joe Biden tried to reassure depositors and investors, saying: Americans can rest assured that our banking system is safe. Your deposits are safe. On Sunday night, the Federal Reserve and Treasury boosted lenders’ access to quick cash, and guaranteed deposits at Signature Bank (which was closed down on Sunday night) and Silicon Valley Bank. But other regional banks still came under pressure, with San Francisco-based First Republic losing 62% and Arizona-headquartered Western Alliance Bank off 47%. On Monday, there were heavy falls on European stock markets, with the UK’s FTSE 100 index sheddding 200 points, or 2.58%, to end at 7548 points, the lowest since the start of January. Markets are expected to open calmer today, though…. Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse last week was the largest bank failure in over a decade. It came after SVB made a $1.8bn loss on a sale of securities, due to the drop in prices of government bond and mortgage-backed securities as interest rates have risen. That left it struggling to meet withdrawal requests from customers. Expectations of further sharp rises in borrowing costs are being reassessed too, with central banks likely to be warier of breaking another part of the financial system. Yesterday was “a wild session on Wall Street as the failure of Silicon Valley Bank revealed the unintended consequence of the Fed’s tightening cycle”, says IG analyst Tony Sycamore: As noted in recent months and in wider financial circles, the Fed has historically continued tightening until something breaks. While the Fed’s move to backstop uninsured deposits will likely prevent further banking runs, a potential banking crisis threat trumps high inflation any day of the week. Reflecting this, the rates market experienced the most significant 2-day fall in U.S. treasury yields since the 1987 crash (yields are now at 4% from 5.08% last week). After being 70% priced for a 50bp rate hike last week, there is now just 12bps priced for next week’s FOMC meeting.

                    "bodyText": "New South Wales will swelter through an unusual burst of summer weather in March, with a heatwave expected to grip the state this week as temperatures in parts of Sydney reach close to 40C. From Wednesday parts of NSW will experience multiple days in the low to mid 30s while other areas will reach the high 30s. “[Sydney] could see a pretty hot one on Thursday, we’ll see 35C in the city and almost near 40C out in the western suburbs,” said Dean Narramore, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology. Narramore said the heat was being dragged across the state from central Australia and would linger across much of NSW until next week. It would probably break along the coast early next week and in inland areas in the middle of next week. While it is normal to get bursts of heat during March, Narramore said it is unusual for the heat to last long. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Many locations just away from the coast and even the western suburbs of Sydney will see anywhere from four to six days … with temperatures anywhere from five to 12 degrees above average,” he said. “It’s not record-breaking by any means, but it’s definitely on the unusual side.” The heat comes just over a week after NSW saw a record-breaking demand for electricity in March at 13,136MW, as Sydney recorded its third-hottest day on record for the month. The Australian Energy Market Operator expected electricity consumption to peak at 11,700MW at 6pm on Thursday and said there was enough supply to meet demand. The wind was likely to pick up across the state alongside the heat, Narramore said, and cautioned people to be mindful of the increased bushfire risk. The bureau also confirmed that the La Niña that has brought much of the rain to the east coast is over. In a statement, the bureau said oceanic and atmospheric indicators have returned to neutral levels and are likely to remain until autumn. But they have also switched to an El Niño watch, saying that there are some signs the weather event could form this year. The bureau’s expert on long-range forecasts, Dr Andrew Watkins, said “drier-than-average conditions” were forecast for the coming months. “Long-range forecasts show there’s an increased chance of below average rainfall for most of Australia during autumn 2023,” he said. “Even if El Niño impacts Australia, this does not necessarily lead to drought. There have been 27 El Niño years since 1900, and about 18 of those years were affected by widespread winter-spring drought.” The bureau emphasised that an El Niño watch was not a “guarantee” that the weather event will occur, but rather an indication that some of the precursors have been observed. The drier-than-usual conditions could be detrimental to the coming bushfire season, with firefighters already battling blazes in NSW. Since last Monday firefighters have responded to more than 290 bush and grassfires in NSW, according to the Rural Fire Service. This included an out-of-control bushfire north of Hill End in the state’s central west which destroyed six homes and tore through 18,000 hectares. A spokesperson for the RFS said grassfires could start easily and spread rapidly under the forecasted dry and windy conditions. “Everyone needs to ensure they have an up-to-date bushfire survival plan and know what they and their family will do if a fire threatens their property,” the spokesperson said."

                    "bodyText": "Queensland police are reviewing complaints made by a whistleblower at the Brisbane watch house, including allegations that staff conducted “illegal” strip-searches, adults exposed themselves to children and a girl being placed in a cell with adult men. The claims were made in a submission to a committee examining the state’s youth crime bill by watch house officer Steven Marshall, which was uploaded to the parliamentary committee’s website before being quickly removed. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In the submission, Marshall described “human rights breaches” he claims he witnessed during 2018 and 2019, such as prisoners not being given underwear and staff wrapping towels around prisoners’ heads to avoid spit hood protocols, causing them to “feel waterboarded”. The Queensland police (QPS) said its ethical standards command has now launched a “review”. “The ethical standards command is currently conducting a manual review of all complaints received in relation to the Brisbane City Watchhouse in 2018 and 2019, in order to identify ongoing or resolved internal investigations relating to the matters requested,” a spokesperson said. In a joint response to the submissions last week, the QPS and the departments of justice and youth justice said Marshall’s submission was “unavailable”, but did not explain why. Guardian Australia has unsuccessfully sought a statement from the committee about why the submission was removed from the parliamentary website. On Wednesday the QPS said “an enquiry” was made to the committee about the submission’s existence after it was removed from the website. It said the submission is “currently with ethical standards command”. The submission was made ahead of parliamentary debate over the government’s youth crime bill this week, which includes making breach of bail an offence for children and expanding an electronic monitoring trial for children as young as 15. Despite concerns that the measures would be ineffective and would increase the risk of more children being placed in adult watch houses, the government is determined to get the bill passed. Marshall last year leaked a series of tapes to Guardian Australia that recorded several QPS staff using racist slurs and offensive language at the watch house. The audio included jokes about one officer’s desire to “skull drag” protesters, discussions of fears of “outbreeding” by Muslim immigrants, and, when speaking about African population growth, the comment “let’s just hope Ebola works”. In other conversations about people of colour held at the watch house, officers can be heard referring to one black detainee as “a gorilla in the mist” and joking about a fellow officer, saying a female Indigenous detainee “won’t give you a fucking blowjob here”. The QPS apologised last November for the “sickening and disturbing” recordings and said the incidents are being investigated. The police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, said the actions of the whistleblower, Steven Marshall, were “excellent” and encouraged officers to come forward with complaints. A QPS spokesperson said that as of 13 March, “the matter is currently under investigation by the ethical standards command and no further information can be provided at this time”."

                    "headline": "How the wind blows in Walcha: a community divided over renewable energy",
                    "bodyText": "In Walcha, the locals say, the wind blows straight up from Cooma and clears the 800km distance in about two minutes flat. It’s that wind that has made it a prized site for renewable energy projects. The northern inland New South Wales town is in the southernmost lobe of the New England Renewable Energy Zone (Rez), the northernmost of the five zones set up by the NSW government to cluster new wind and solar projects together for ease of storage and transmission. One project in development to make use of all that Walcha wind is the Winterbourne windfarm, the majority stakeholder of which is Danish renewable energy company Vestas. The project has been in development since 2004 and the company says it hopes to start building in 2024. The proposal involves building “up to 119” turbines with a maximum blade tip height of 230 metres across the north and east of the town. The proponents of the project say the turbines will be a boon to the region and its people, while opponents say it’s a risk to tourism, biodiversity and the town’s aesthetics. It’s a familiar argument, repeated up and down the east coast under a wave of new windfarm developments. Among the most vocal detractors is the former National party leader and New England MP, Barnaby Joyce, who has argued that the region should instead work to extend the life of its existing coal power stations until new nuclear technology is available. Joyce has found himself on the same side of at least some of the arguments with treechangers and local conservationists, concerned about the environmental impact of the proposed windfarm, and on the opposite side to a number of local farmers who see themselves on the frontline of climate change. ‘We need to diversify’ The Fletchers are one of the families willing to speak out in favour of Winterbourne. The land that’s been in their family since 1863 is slated to host some of the turbines. Warwick Fletcher, who runs sheep and cattle, sees it as a chance for Walcha to be at the forefront of renewable energy development. It is a win-win for farmers, he says: the royalties from hosting turbines will be a stable income stream; and the switch to renewables will lessen the impact of the climate crisis. “Our production is governed by rain,” Fletcher says. “We’ve had years where we had negative returns on assets, year in, year out. Everybody keeps telling us we can’t afford to rely on handouts – we need to diversify.” Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter For Warwick’s daughter, Holly, it is about future-proofing the farm. “We know the effects of climate change are real,” she says. “The people in the bush experience it more than anyone else in the country.” Walcha’s population of just over 3,000 is ageing. With younger workers forced to move away for employment, there’s less money in the town and fewer reasons to stay. The project comes with the promise of a $1m community development fund, with an additional $750,000 a year once the generators are turned on and a further $1,000 for every megawatt generated over 600MW. With a projected output of 700MW, that’s up to $850,000 a year for a town that sorely needs investment. Vestas also says the project will create up to 400 jobs during construction and 16 maintenance jobs once operational. The town needs the money. “The inequality [in Walcha] is incredible,” Fletcher says. It’s not the only project in the area: the first stage of the 720MW New England solar farm at Uralla, 40km from Walcha, opened on Wednesday. Other communities are cashing in. Fletcher is frustrated that Joyce, his local MP, and the National party, aren’t backing a project that is offering that level of financial support. “How many Nationals in federal parliament?” Fletcher says. “There’s going to be less and less people in the bush to vote for them.” An unlikely alliance of opponents Most of the opponents to the windfarm are concerned about the impact it may have on threatened species, as well as concerns about construction, turbine height, end-of-life of disposal of blades, noise, and the appropriateness of the community consultation. Others, like Barnaby Joyce, just oppose windfarms in general. Rachel and Cameron Greig are members of Voice For Walcha and are concerned about its proximity to Oxley Wild Rivers national park. “Winterbourne’s [environmental impact statement] describes the concentration as 0.66 wedgetail eagles per hectare per hour,” Rachel says. “At any other windfarm that they’ve got this measured for it goes from 0.11 to 0.44,” she says. “So it’s really one-and-a-half times higher than any other windfarms that they’ve mentioned. Wedgies get killed at these windfarms.” Most of their concerns come directly from the Winterbourne proposal documents. The EIS states the project will also “result in the loss of up to 206.73 hectares of potential habitat” for koalas and “a significant residual impact is considered likely”. The total cost of required environmental offsets will be $64.3m, the EIS states. The total cost of the project, Vestas says, will be $1.9bn. “It’s going to lead to loss of habitat to threatened species, including koalas, quolls and gliders,” Rachel Greig says. Cameron Greig argues that placing the turbines at the edge of the national park could potentially create an issue for aerial firefighting, by obstructing the bombers. “With turbines against that area, they’ve lost a pretty crucial tool to get control of those areas – in a smoky environment or in low cloud, those areas just become no-fly zones,” he says. The Rural Fire Service told Guardian Australia that wind turbines could be negotiated like any other obstacle. “Wind turbines are treated in the same way as other hazards across the landscape, such as power lines, radio or television transmission towers and mountains, all of which need to be taken into account in mission planning and by individual pilots,” a spokesperson said. Both Joyce, who has a property at nearby Woolbrook, and the National party state member for Northern Tablelands, Adam Marshall, attended a Voice for Walcha meeting in January in opposition to the project. Walcha was previously in the state electorate for Tamworth, but will fall under Northern Tablelands in the redrawn electoral boundaries for the 25 March poll. Marshall told the gathering the proposal contained “the very worst EIS I have ever, ever seen”. Joyce repeated calls for nuclear reactors to replace ageing coal-fired generators, instead of wind, and asked locals to march on Canberra. “I’m gonna tell you one thing: the [wind turbine] technology will be so out of date, it will be ridiculous. It will be antiquated,” Joyce told the crowd at the Walcha Bowling Club. “Personally, I believe that nuclear power will be in, and it’ll be something that would fit in this room that will do the job of thousands of wind turbines.” In a statement to Guardian Australia, Vestas says the company recognises “that change can be difficult and the transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy involves regional areas like Walcha”. It says it remains committed to engaging with the community openly and transparently. The Walcha mayor, Eric Noakes, says the council has taken a “neutral stance” on the project, with “councillors for it, councillors against it”. Noakes says the project has been “divisive” and he hopes the fault lines don’t run too deep. “We’ve always been a tight community – we’ve got to be a tight community to survive the tough times,” he says. “We’ll need our resilience as a community again one day.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community"

                    "bodyText": "Rowan Ramsey, the Liberal MP who faces the prospect of a nuclear waste dump in his South Australian electorate, has said he is “amazed” the government will begin the search in just 12 months for a facility that won’t be required for decades. The comments come as green groups rally against a key component of the Aukus nuclear submarine acquisition: that Australia is required to dispose of the waste generated by its Virginia-class submarines and the new SSN-Aukus submarine. On Tuesday the deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, announced that Australia would need a new facility, remote from the population, to dispose of nuclear waste on defence land, whether current or future. “Now to be clear, the first of the naval reactors that we will be disposing of will not happen until the 2050s,” Marles told reporters in Canberra. “But within the year, we will announce a process by which this facility will be identified.” According to defence department documents, the department will work with the Australian Radioactive Waste Agency to undertake a review in 2023 to identify locations “that could be suitable to store and dispose of intermediate-level waste and high-level waste, including spent fuel”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Ramsey, whose electorate of Grey covers 908,595 sq km – the majority of South Australia – said he was “amazed” given the 33-year life of the Virginia-class submarine that a waste facility is required as soon as the 2050s. Australia has struggled with the question of where to store its slowly accumulating intermediate nuclear waste for decades. The Morrison government chose a site near the town of Kimba, in Grey, but the local Barngarla people united against the plan. The Albanese government has continued to pursue using the Kimba site. Ramsey said there is “no way” the Kimba site “could, should or would be a repository for high level waste”. “You need 400 metres of solid, dry granite. There are no assessments like that around Kimba, it’s a completely different facility to the one proposed.” Ramsey said defence land near the remote village of Woomera, also in his electorate, “may well be suitable, but so may a lot of other sites” around Australia. “Geographically and geologically Woomera would be fine.” The Australian Conservation Foundation has raised the alarm about Australia housing nuclear waste, with its analyst Dave Sweeney pointing to its “scant real world experience”. “Successive federal governments have searched, without success, for a site for low and intermediate-level waste for more than three decades,” Sweeney said. “This waste remains poisonous and carcinogenic for tens of thousands of years. “Aukus presents by far the biggest threat yet that Australia will become a dumping ground for the world’s worst nuclear waste. “If defence applies its standard, highly secretive approach to the management of this high-level nuclear waste, hundreds of generations of Australians will live with the consequences.” On Tuesday the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, called for a “sensible, mature debate” about nuclear energy, waste and its disposal, urging critics to “grow up”. “We dispose of nuclear waste now in our country … we dispose of it safely,” Dutton told reporters in Canberra. “We’ve got … an incredibly stable environment to store nuclear waste.” Dutton said the Coalition “won’t be playing politics … we will support the government in its decision to deal with the waste”. Asked about housing others’ waste, Marles told ABC TV that managing the nuclear material and reactors powering Australian submarines “is an important part of Australia’s nuclear stewardship and that is all we’re focused on”."

                    "bodyText": "Air pollution in New South Wales is estimated to cause 603 premature deaths and increase health costs by $4.8bn each year, according to a long-term government study. Published online the day before the Perrottet government went into caretaker mode ahead of this month’s state election, the Sydney air quality study suggests most people in the city’s greater metropolitan region are exposed to air pollution at levels considered unsafe by the World Health Organization. The largest source of air pollution was found to be wood heaters, which are used in about 10% of homes across the region. The study found they were likely to contribute to 269 premature deaths annually. Users of wood heaters were estimated to have lost 3,279 years of life between them– an average of about 12 years a person. The increase in state health costs due to wood heater pollution was calculated to be more than $2bn. Other major causes of air pollution affecting health were industrial sites including mines (133 deaths and $1bn in health costs), cars and trucks (110 deaths and $832m) and coal power stations (46 deaths and $346m). Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Brad Smith, policy director with the Nature Conservation Council, said the results showed air pollution was a “silent epidemic”. He said it underlined the need for governments to “leave coal, gas and oil in the ground and wood in forests”. “It’s clear that burning wood, petrol and coal is killing us, and imposing a huge health cost on Sydneysiders,” he said. The study examined the concentration of PM2.5 – particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These invisible fine particles can be inhaled and enter the bloodstream. They cause heart and lung disease. The aged, children and people with previous heart and lung problems are considered most at risk. WHO guidelines, updated in 2021, recommend exposure to average PM2.5 levels of less than 5 micrograms a cubic metre over a year. The study estimated the average for Sydney was 6.43. They reached 12 in parts of the Upper Hunter. Across the region, about half (48%) the modelled air pollution was from human-made sources and half (52%) natural sources. While wood heaters and road vehicles were the biggest sources of air pollution in Sydney itself, pollution in the Hunter was largely caused by coalmines, coal power generation and diesel vehicles used at mines. Coal mining was found to be responsible for about 50% of industrial emissions across the region, though this may be a slightly outdated figure. The study used 2013 data and coal power generation has declined by nearly 20% in the decade since. The Department of Planning and Environment said NSW enjoyed its best air quality last year since the monitoring network began nearly three decades ago, but international health studies had shown that long-term exposure to air pollution could “shorten lives and hasten the burden of disease”. A department spokesperson stressed the number of premature deaths attributable to poor air quality was an estimate, based on the methods used in global studies. They said the state was taking steps to reduce the adverse effects of air pollution as set out in the state’s clean air strategy. “The [study] provides valuable information to government, business and communities on air quality and its impacts on public health and the environment,” the spokesperson said. Donna Green, an environmental scientist at the University of New South Wales, has previously told Guardian Australia that high levels of PM2.5 could “affect every system in your body, which means you’re not only talking about respiratory-related and heart-related problems, people are linking it to diabetes [and] dementia”. She said rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions could increase the levels of some air pollutants. Smith said the reliance on wood heaters could be solved by banning their sale and offering incentives for households to switch to reverse-cycle electric heaters. By 2030, every bus and garbage truck in the state should be electric and coal power should be replaced by renewable energy and storage, he said. “These astronomical health costs really put radical policy solutions on the table,” he said. “For example, the cost of reducing all public transport fares to $1 is estimated at $750m. That’s less than the annual health cost caused by petrol and diesel vehicles of $900m.”"

                    "bodyText": "New South Wales Labor is being criticised for directing preferences to the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party in a key marginal seat despite helping to pass a motion that condemned its leader, Robert Borsak, over an alleged verbal “threat of violence” against a female MP. Material filed with the NSW Electoral Commission shows Labor is directing voters to preference the Shooters party in the seat of Upper Hunter ahead of the state election on 25 March. Held by the Nationals on a wafer-thin margin of 0.5%, it is one of two lower house seats – along with the electorate of Dubbo, where the Shooters hope to unseat the Nationals MP Dugald Saunders – where Labor has directed its preferences to the minor party. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But Labor is also directing upper house preferences to the Shooters in 15 seats across regional NSW, either as its third or fourth preference, a move it has defended as being necessary to stop One Nation’s leader, Mark Latham, from becoming “the kingmaker of NSW politics”. Among the 15 seats is Murray, held by the former Shooters MP Helen Dalton, who is now an independent. Although the party has ranked Dalton second in its lower house preferences, in the upper house it recommended voters in Murray put the Shooters third. It comes less than six months after Labor supported a motion moved by Dalton in the lower house that condemned Borsak for comments he allegedly made in parliament about her. A recording of a debate in parliament last September appeared to capture someone, alleged to be Borsak, saying “he should’ve gotten up and clocked her”. Dalton alleged the comment was made in relation to her and moved a motion in the parliament condemning him for making “a threat of violence”. The motion stated Borsak’s “threat” constituted “dangerous workplace behaviour” and called on him to apologise. It was supported by Labor MPs, including the shadow minister for families, Port Stephens MP Kate Washington, who said it was “important that this place is a safe place for women – and everyone – to work”. “Violence and threats of violence against members in this place are entirely unacceptable,” she said during the debate. The fallout was devastating for the Shooters, with its two lower house MPs – Phil Donato in Orange and Roy Butler in Barwon – quitting to run as independents instead. Labor’s move has been blasted by the Coalition’s minister for women, Natalie Ward, who said the opposition leader, Chris Minns, “needs to explain why he is supporting Robert Borsak, when his own MPs left the party following his appalling treatment of a female MP”. While the opposition hopes to see the Nationals unseated in Upper Hunter – one of the few regional seats where the conservative Shooters may still be in play – Labor sources also insist the move was intended to help limit One Nation’s chances of securing a second or third upper house spot. The prospect of a larger One Nation contingent has grown in the wake of the declining fortunes of other minor rightwing parties such as the Liberal Democrats and Fred Nile’s Christian Democrats. “That would make Mark Latham the kingmaker of NSW politics – on everything to do from climate change, renewables, public education, anti-discrimination and anti-racism policies,” a Labor campaign spokesperson said. “NSW Labor has given some preferences – with none in return – to try and stop that super crossbench majority forming in the upper house.” Both Labor and Borsak said there had been no deal between the two parties. Borsak declined to comment on last year’s controversy. The election analyst Ben Raue said depending on the way votes in the upper house go, the decision to put the Shooters third and fourth in a handful of seats could help the party on election day. While the majority of voters do not follow how-to-vote guides, preferences “do make a difference”, he said. “At the last three elections the final seat changed because of preference flows favouring a particular candidate,” he said."

                    "bodyText": "Public school cleaners in New South Wales are given less than a minute to mop floors, clean toilets and empty bins each day, with a major union claiming the “impossible workload” has led to one of the state’s highest worker’s compensation premiums. Documents obtained by the United Workers Union detail how cleaners in state public schools are being asked to complete several hundred individual tasks each day as part of their daily work routine. A copy of contract specifications for one of a handful of private companies contracted to clean the state’s schools show how cleaners are expected to complete 179 “regular” tasks as well as dozens more classed as “periodic”. According to the union, those “regular” jobs are repeated multiple times to add up to more than 600 every day, based on the workload of an average cleaner. This equates to about 47 seconds a task. Linda Revill, property services coordinator at UWU, said the “stopwatch approach” had led to “unsafe workloads” for one of the lowest-paid professions in the state. “Cleaners are stressed about not finishing their jobs, they are injuring themselves in the rush and students, teachers and schools are left without the required cleaning,” she said. The UWU points to iCare premiums as evidence cleaners in public schools have one of the highest injury rates in NSW; the most recent data from the state insurer shows the industry ranks alongside saw millers in terms of its classification. Premiums for cleaners in the public system are also double what they are for the same job in the non-government school system. “The demoralising truth is NSW public school cleaners have the highest injury rates in NSW from more than 500 different professions, with injury rates equalled only by saw millers,” Revill said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The union has used the document to call for NSW Labor and the Coalition to scrap the private contracting system ahead of the state election in less than two weeks. “The privatised approach where cleaners are treated as robots rather than human beings has to stop,” Revill said. After the union raised its concerns about cleaner workloads, Labor promised to review the contracts, which it says will be completed by 2024 should the party win government. “School cleaners work incredibly hard and only thanks to their efforts have students been able to return to the classroom across the state,” she said. “An elected Minns Labor government will review the cleaning services in NSW public schools to ensure these services are high quality into the future.” The union says the contract specification document – seen by Guardian Australia – equates to cleaners “being exposed to unsafe workloads daily”. It provided breakdowns of the number of rooms and buildings cleaned by individual workers each day to justify that claim. Justine Hughes, a cleaner who works in a public school in regional NSW, said that the workload outlined by the union matched her experience over 11 years in the system. Hughes, 57, said the reality was that “some things don’t get done because you do not have the time humanly to do it”. She found it “demoralising”, she said, “to never have enough time for what they want you to do”. “So many people come in and last a week or less than a week and say I can’t do this,” she said. “There’s never any ‘great job’, or anything like that, It’s always not good enough.” Hughes said she had injured herself twice while working, including one incident after which she claimed worker’s compensation, and said she believed her workload played a part. “Because you’re not thinking about yourself, instead of thinking ‘I should be bending my knees when I pick up this bucket of water’ you’re just rushing around trying to get everything done,” she said. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Education said the contracts had been implemented in 2019 as part of a “whole-of-government cleaning contract was implemented worth $1.7bn. “We undertook extensive stakeholder consultation in relation to the cleaning contracts after a tender process. The new contract incorporated the cleaning standards that have been applied to all NSW schools in previous contracts,” the spokesperson said. While it said the “health, safety and wellbeing of students and staff in our schools is of paramount importance”, the department also said it was the contractors responsibility “to manage their staff including identifying risks and controlling those risks to ensure their health, wellbeing, and safety”. “If injuries occur the cleaning contractors are required under NSW legislation to provide the necessary coverage and support for their staff,” the spokesperson said. “If schools have concerns regarding the standard of cleaning at their schools, they can raise these with us and we will work with the cleaning contractors to ensure that the standards are met.”"

                    "bodyText": "A 13-year-old First Nations boy remanded for minor criminal offences was kept in total solitary confinement in a Queensland youth detention centre for at least 45 days, Guardian Australia has learned. It is understood the boy also claimed that on one occasion he was denied drinking water at the Cleveland youth detention centre (CYDT) in Townsville, after he became distressed during a prolonged period in isolation and flooded the cell. From 1 February, he spent 22 days straight entirely in solitary confinement. During almost two months in detention, the boy was allowed to leave his cell on five days. The child’s treatment inside the Cleveland youth prison is the most extreme of several recent cases, where courts have raised human rights concerns about the extent of isolation and described conditions as “cruel” and “inappropriate”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Queensland’s parliament is this week debating new youth justice laws, including plans to override the Human Rights Act and criminalise bail breaches by children. Experts warn the plan will cause the population of young detainees to “explode” and heighten human rights concerns in a youth justice system already showing signs of buckling. Youth detention centres are already at capacity and large numbers of children – at one point, more than 80 – are being warehoused in adult police watch houses. The Cleveland youth detention centre has also been subject to chronic staff shortages, resulting in prolonged “blackout” periods where children are not allowed to leave their cells. Most children imprisoned in the Queensland youth justice system are on remand. Those numbers have increased significantly since the introduction of 2019 bail laws, which reversed the presumption in favour of bail in cases where there is an “unacceptable risk” to community safety. In practice, that has meant dozens of children have been sent to prison – unsentenced – in cases where their alleged offending was not serious enough to warrant a period of imprisonment at sentence. In the case of the 13-year-old boy, he was initially arrested in October 2022 in relation to a fight with another boy. In January 2023, the boy was arrested for further offences, including property offences and attempted unauthorised use of a motor vehicle. He was formally reprimanded in the children’s court last week, with his probation order extended by a month. But despite not ultimately receiving a custodial sentence, the boy spent a total of 60 days imprisoned on remand, including six days in adult watch houses at Cairns and Mareeba, and 54 days at Cleveland. During an initial 14-day period at Cleveland, from 27 October to 10 November, the boy was confined entirely to his cell. From 30 January to 6 March, the boy was imprisoned at Cleveland and only allowed out of his cell on five days. He was in solitary confinement in his cell from 1 February to 23 February. Information about his imprisonment at the detention centre does not include details about his final four days, from 7 to 10 March. The court has not published a judgment in relation to the boy’s case. But in several recent cases, the courts have raised concerns about the treatment of children and warned that prison conditions would heighten the risk of reoffending. Judge Tracy Fantin published a judgment last month relating to another 13-year-old boy – who has developmental disorders – who spent extended periods in solitary confinement. Fantin said the circumstances of the child’s imprisonment breached several principles of the state’s Youth Justice Act. The judge also drew clear links between the treatment of children in prison and the likelihood they would reoffend. She said the boy’s period in detention “will have achieved little or nothing to protect the community from … future offending”. “Indeed, it may well have increased the risk of further offending … and the state of Queensland must bear responsibility for that. “If you treat a child like an animal, it is unsurprising that they may behave like an animal.” The state’s youth justice minister, Leanne Linard, said “separations” – jargon for keeping children in solitary confinement – were used “as a last resort and are subject to strict controls”. “At all times during a separation, young people have access to visits and professional support services, phone calls, education material, meal routines and recreational activities,” Linard said. “The Department of Children, Youth Justice and Multicultural Affairs has been working to address staffing issues at CYDC. “I met with the executive director of CYDC last week and was briefed on initiatives that have been implemented, including state and national recruitment campaigns and temporarily using staff from other centres to complement local staff and ensure young people’s engagement in programs. These initiatives are making a difference at the centre.”"

Given that Australia’s multi-decade plan to gain nuclear-powered submarines will require the support of successive US administrations, a reporter asked the Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, a very direct question on Tuesday: “Are you concerned that a future US president will tear it up?” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The answer was not immediate. He took a deep breath and paused for eight seconds before settling on the response: “Well – I’m not – is the answer to your question.” Perhaps it was just the fact that Marles was up before the crack of dawn to sell a project that carries the eye-watering price tag of as much as $368bn between now and the 2050s. But the pause seemed to betray an understanding of just one of many risks surrounding the Aukus gambit, which also requires ongoing British support under the three-country deal. Marles is a strong supporter of the US alliance – and is no “Manchurian candidate” as he was cartoonishly portrayed before the 2022 election – but he is on the record as having aired some concerns in the past about the superpower’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific. It was not just an increasingly assertive China that was fuelling the most challenging strategic outlook for Australia since the second world war, Marles wrote in his 2021 book, Tides That Bind. It was also an “unpredictable” US, he wrote then, that posed difficulties for its allies in the region. “There is a question mark over the future role of the US both in East Asia and globally,” Marles wrote. That followed a tumultuous period marked by Donald Trump’s “America First” rhetoric, in which the then US president was openly sceptical of alliances and demanded Japan and South Korea shoulder more of the burden. Trump also abandoned a key regional trade agreement, which would have been a signal of enduring American economic engagement with the region. That deal, known then as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, was meant to set the “rules of the road” rather than leaving it to China to do so; now China wants to join the rebadged CPTPP. Fast forward to today, and Marles is now the deputy prime minister and defence minister in an Australian Labor government that is making a big bet in the face of that uncertainty. He is reassured by the approach taken by Joe Biden’s administration – but maybe the only sure thing in Aukus is that it will reach its peak in the post-Biden era. Marles told reporters on Tuesday the US alliance had “thrived under successive administrations and governments” and he believed Aukus would similarly be “an enduring arrangement”. Citing strong support in the US congress, he added: “Across the political spectrum, there is complete support for the relationship with Australia and the Aukus arrangements, so we enter this with a high degree of confidence.” In an attempt to put that enduring commitment beyond doubt, Australia has agreed to sling a few billion dollars towards the US over the next four years to prop up its already strained production capacity. This could well be politically unpalatable at a time of budget pressures, but Canberra considers this a necessary downpayment towards the US being prepared to sell at least three (and as many as five) of its Virginia class submarines to Australia in the 2030s. Still, it is not hard to imagine a future president – Trump or otherwise – rethinking that sale on the basis of prioritising US needs above those of Australia. “The Aukus agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment in Australia’s defence capability in our history,” the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said in San Diego alongside Biden, and the UK’s Rishi Sunak, all three surrounded by their flags. In the meantime, work will begin to prepare the Osborne shipyard in South Australia for the massive undertaking of building a British-designed submarine featuring US tech, as the longer term solution. Construction is meant to start by the end of this decade, but the first of these Australian-built boats is not likely to be ready for the Royal Australian Navy until the 2040s onwards. The Australian government was out and about on Tuesday promoting the opportunities created by Aukus: potentially thousands of jobs in the long term, a boost to science and tech knowhow, and the revival of domestic manufacturing. These could well be significant. But the security partnership is also full of risks. The first relates to the cost. The forecast range of $268bn to $368bn between now and the mid 2050s is a cumulative bill for the entire program – including building up the facilities in Australia, buying the Virginia class subs, building the next-generation British designed submarine, and sustaining them all. Most of this spending is beyond the first four-year budget period, and the government plays down the cost by saying it equates to 0.15% of gross domestic product a year on average. This submarine program cost is a subset of a Labor pledge to spend, overall, at least 2% of GDP on defence each year. But history tells us the cost of defence acquisitions only ever goes up. Another risk surrounds the technical complexity of the project, and whether Australia will face difficulties recruiting and training up the naval personnel, other supporting workers and nuclear specialists who will be required to make it a success (and operate the boats safely). Going for a new design is also inherently risky – although the defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, said on Tuesday the government had sought to reduce that risk by having a delay of a few years between the first submarine entering into the UK’s service and the first one being handed over to the Australian navy. That is a long way off, so the US and the UK will start rotational deployments of their nuclear-powered submarines to Western Australia from 2027. This will not technically be classified as a “foreign base”, because these submarines are not there permanently, but will be a very visible sign to the region of Aukus ramping up. Perhaps the most significant aspect of Aukus is the long-term call Australia has made about the strategic circumstances and the intentions of the Chinese government. The Australian government has been unequivocal that the Australian submarines will be under Australia’s command and control – and only deployed based on sovereign decisions in Canberra. But there is no getting away from the fact Australia will be dependent on the US and the UK for key technology required to make the deal work, and the three countries will be increasingly integrated in their operations. Aukus reflects the bipartisan consensus between the major Australian political parties that the much bigger risk involves China’s military buildup and intentions, most sharply related to the future of democratically governed Taiwan. Australia is betting (or hoping) that the Aukus deal will contribute to a maintaining “strategic equilibrium” that will deter Beijing from launching military action to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. The calculation is that such military action would be highly destructive to the region as a whole."

                    "headline": "First Thing: global markets gripped by Silicon Valley Bank collapse",
                    "bodyText": "Good morning. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) is gripping the financial markets, as global bank shares slide despite reassurances from Joe Biden yesterday. There have been fresh losses in Asia Pacific stock markets today, as bank stocks continue to fall, while shares in a number of America’s regional banks closed sharply lower on Monday. The bank’s parent company, SVB Financial Group, and two top executives have been sued by shareholders over the collapse of SVB. The bank’s shareholders accuse the group chief executive, Greg Becker, and the chief financial officer, Daniel Beck, of concealing how rising interest rates would leave its SVB unit “particularly susceptible” to a bank run. Shockwaves from the collapse of SVB pounded global bank stocks further today, with calls for calm from Biden and other policymakers doing little to reassure markets and prompting some analysts to rethink their outlook on interest rates. What has Biden said about the situation? “Americans can rest assured that our banking system is safe. Your deposits are safe. Let me also assure you, we will not stop at this. We’ll do whatever is needed,” he said yesterday. Is the US response to SVB’s collapse a bailout? Given the antipathy towards Wall Street bailouts in the 2008 crisis, Biden and elected and appointed officials have been at pains to insist the emergency interventions to protect deposits in SVB and Signature Bank, a second bank that failed at the weekend – or, indeed, any further bank failures – won’t come at taxpayers’ expense. What else is happening? Follow our live blog here. Joe Biden to unveil executive order to crack down on law-breaking gun sellers Joe Biden will announce today that he is ordering the attorney general, Merrick Garland, to crack down on gun sellers who break the law, “moving the US as close to universal background checks as possible”, the White House said. The president will speak in Monterey Park, California, meeting victims’ families and community members devastated by a mass shooting that killed 11 people and injured nine others in January. Opinion polls show a majority of Democrats and Republicans support universal background checks that would reveal whether a person is a convicted criminal or domestic abuser before allowing them to buy a gun. But with Republicans in control of the House of Representatives, there is little hope of Congress heeding Biden’s pleas to pass legislation. On a swing through California, the president will acknowledge this political reality and unveil an executive order to enforce existing laws against gun sellers who, knowingly or otherwise, fail to run the background checks they should. What will Garland be asked to do? Biden will ask Garland to clarify the statutory definition of who is “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms, the White House said. “Number one, to make it clear that those who are wilfully violating the law need to come into compliance with the law and, number two, to make it clear to people who may not realise that, under that statutory definition they are indeed in the business of selling firearms, they must become federally licensed firearm dealers and they must run background checks before gun sales.” China says Aukus submarines deal embarks on ‘path of error and danger’ China has accused the US, UK and Australia of embarking on a “path of error and danger” in response to the Aukus partners’ announcement of a deal on nuclear-powered submarines. “The latest joint statement from the US, UK and Australia demonstrates that the three countries, for the sake of their own geopolitical interests, completely disregard the concerns of the international communities and are walking further and further down the path of error and danger,” China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said during a regular press briefing on Tuesday. The multibillion-dollar deal, announced during a meeting of Aukus leaders in San Diego on Monday, will provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines in an effort to counter the rise of China in the Indo-Pacific. The spokesperson’s comments came after the Chinese mission to the UN tweeted a statement accusing the three countries of fuelling an arms race. It said the deal was a “textbook case of double standard”. How did Biden respond to what China has said about the deal? The US president, Joe Biden, rejected the accusation, saying the submarines would be “nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed”. Penny Wong, Australia’s foreign minister, said the Chinese criticism was “not grounded in fact”.

In the US, where most banks do not offer instant free money transfers, it was revolutionary for simple things such as splitting the bill on dinner, or sending roommates half of the rent. But because the Venmo app has a “home feed”, an endless scroll that shows payments between users, it’s also a sneaky form of social media, writes Alaina Demopoulos. You can see how your friends spend their money – and who they spend it with. Though users have the option to make their payments private, many forget to. Two in five Venmo users reveal “sensitive information” on the app. When Daily Beast journalists snooped Matt Gaetz’s transactions, they discovered the Florida representative had paid an accused sex trafficker through the app. We hear from those who discovered something big. Climate check: why Biden’s approval of Willow drilling project is ‘a colossal stain’ on his legacy Joe Biden continues to confound on the climate crisis. Hailed as the US’s first “climate president”, Biden signed sweeping legislation to tackle global heating last year and has warned rising temperatures are an “existential threat to humanity”. And yet on Monday his administration decided to approve one of the largest oil drilling projects staged in the US in decades. The green light given to the Willow development on the remote tundra of Alaska’s northern Arctic coast, swatting aside the protests of millions of online petitioners, progressives in Congress and even Al Gore, will have global reverberations. Biden’s approval of this is “a colossal and reprehensible stain on his environmental legacy”, according to Raena Garcia, a fossil fuels campaigner at Friends of the Earth. Last Thing: Colombia floats new strategy for Escobar’s hippos – ship them abroad In the 1980s, the drug lord Pablo Escobar imported four hippos from Africa to join his giraffes, camels, ostriches and other exotic animals in the menagerie at his lavish Hacienda Nápoles estate, but after his death in 1993 they escaped and now it is thought the feral herd numbers 80. The government has repeatedly failed to tame the booming population that have made the Magdalena River basin their new home. It tried culling the animals in 2009 but had to stop after a graphic photo caused national outrage. It continues to sterilise the hippos but they are breeding faster than local experts can find, catch and castrate them. Now the regional government wants to try a new strategy. Like Escobar’s cocaine, they hope Pablo’s pets can be shipped abroad. Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday. If you’re not already signed up, subscribe now.

                    "headline": "Aukus nuclear submarine deal loophole prompts proliferation fears",
                    "bodyText": "The Aukus scheme announced on Monday in San Diego represents the first time a loophole in the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has been used to transfer fissile material and nuclear technology from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. The loophole is paragraph 14, and it allows fissile material utilised for non-explosive military use, like naval propulsion, to be exempt from inspections and monitoring by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It makes arms controls experts nervous because it sets a precedent that could be used by others to hide highly enriched uranium, or plutonium, the core of a nuclear weapon, from international oversight. On Tuesday, the Chinese mission to the UN accused the US and UK of “clearly violating the object and purpose of the NPT”, adding that “such a textbook case of double standard will damage the authority and effectiveness of the international non-proliferation system”. “The nuclear submarine cooperation plan released today by Aukus is a blatant act that constitutes serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines international non-proliferation system, fuels arms races, and hurts peace and stability in the region,” the mission said. The IAEA said in a statement on Tuesday that Australia, the US and UK had informed it of the deal, but reiterated that the “legal obligations” of the three countries to non-proliferation were “paramount”. “Ultimately, the [IAEA] must ensure that no proliferation risks will emanate from this project,” it said. The Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, supports the steps taken by Aukus, Kyodo News reported. The government said the nuclear-powered submarine procurement plan was explained to Kishida in a phone call with the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, on Tuesday. The Aukus partners have held intensive discussions with the IAEA about the plans and taken steps to limit the risk. Early on in the talks, the idea was floated that paragraph 14 might not be invoked at all, and the nuclear fuel would be kept under IAEA safeguards. However, the IAEA was not prepared to have its inspection standards watered down to the extent that the agency would not be able to determine the timing of a visit, and the Aukus partners were squeamish about letting an international team of inspectors onboard their state-of-the-art submarines. To mitigate the proliferation risk, the Australians have agreed not to have a training reactor on their territory, but to train their submariners in the US and UK instead. Australia will not enrich or reprocess the spent nuclear fuel, and the fissile material provided by the US and UK will come in welded units that do not have to be refuelled in their lifetime. Australia has undertaken not to acquire the equipment necessary to chemically reprocess spent fuel that would make it usable in a weapon. “Since day one of this effort, or consultation period, we have prioritised non-proliferation,” a senior US official said. The IAEA director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has said he believes the Aukus partners “are committed to ensuring the highest non-proliferation and safeguards standards are met”, and noted his “satisfaction with the engagement and transparency shown by the three countries thus far”. “I do think the three countries are quite serious about trying to mitigate the harm to the non-proliferation regime. I think they’ve done a very good job engaging with the IAEA,” James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said. “But I still think there is real and concrete harm done. “The primary problem with Aukus was always the precedent set, that Australia would be the first country that would remove nuclear fuel from safeguards for use in naval reactors,” Acton added. “My fear was never that Australia would misuse that fuel, but that other countries would invoke Aukus as a precedent for removing nuclear fuel from safeguards.”"

On Tuesday Wang said China did not want to “communicate for the sake of communicating” but that “the US side should come forward sincerely, with practical actions to promote China-US relations”. Relations between China and the US are at their lowest in decades. Various channels of communication, including military dialogues, have been paused since Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the US House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in August, angering China. In February the US shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that floated into US airspace. China said it was a meteorological monitoring device that had blown off course, but the US rejected that claim and cancelled a long-awaited trip by Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, to Beijing. The US and its allies are increasingly worried about the prospect of China launching a conflict with Taiwan, which would be catastrophic for the self-governing island’s 23 million people and would spill over into the rest of the region. Observers are watching closely for signs that China’s military is preparing for such an attack. On Monday Xi closed China’s annual parliamentary session with a speech in which he promised to build China’s armed forces into a “great wall of steel”. On Tuesday, Taiwan’s foreign ministry said it “welcomes the continued advancement of the Aukus partnership”, noting that Taiwan is “at the forefront of the fight against authoritarian expansion”. Biden has promised to respond militarily if China invades Taiwan, but of the allies Australia would be the first to feel the impact of a conflict in the Indo-Pacific. Anthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, said the Aukus deal, which is forecast to cost $268bn (£220bn) to $368bn, was the “biggest single investment in Australia’s defence capability in all of its history”. Analysts quoted in Chinese state media said it was an “expensive mistake”."

                    "bodyText": "What we learned today, Tuesday 14 March Thanks for following along on the blog today, on what was a huge day of news. Here’s a wrap of the main highlights: The Aukus deal between Australia, the UK and the US dominated the news cycle today, with prime minister Anthony Albanese making the announcement in San Diego alongside the other world leaders. The agreement will see Australia acquire, operate and eventually build nuclear-powered submarines as part of a program costing an estimated $268bn to $368bn between now and the mid 2050s. Amid the myriad of responses and reactions, Labor accused opposition leader Peter Dutton of using the plan as ‘excuse’ to back NDIS cuts, while foreign affairs minister Penny Wong hit back at claims from China that the submarines will fuel an arms race. You can read a comprehensive explainer on the Aukus deal below: Outside of the Aukus announcement, the Bureau of Meteorology confirmed that La Niña is over and that there is a 50% chance of an El Niño this year. Sydneysiders were hit with even more train delays today, following a network-wide shutdown last Wednesday. Reports emerged that an internal Transport for NSW document from more than a year ago warned of “obsolete” system components. Thanks to archival footage, Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh’s links to Australia have been revealed. The Everything, Everywhere All at Once star won a beauty pageant at Melbourne’s Moomba festival and was crowned Miss Moomba in 1984, shortly before starting her acting career. Record major flooding at Burketown in Queensland is starting to ease and is expected to continue this over the coming days, but is likely to remain above the major flood level tomorrow. Floodwaters are delaying people returning to their homes to begin cleaning up, while three-quarters of the homes in Burketown have water over their floorboards. Ferry operator fined $75k over polo pony deaths Spirit of Tasmania ferry operator TT-Line and the former Australian polo captain Andrew Williams have been fined a combined $90,000 over the deaths of 16 horses, AAP has reported. The polo ponies were discovered dead in their converted refrigeration transport trailer following an overnight Bass Strait crossing from Tasmania to Victoria in January 2018. TT-Line was found guilty in October of 29 animal welfare law breaches, while Williams pleaded guilty in July to 17 counts of breaching the animal welfare act. During sentencing in Burnie magistrates court on Tuesday, TT-Line was fined $75,000 and Williams $15,000. The magistrate Leanne Topfer said although there was no intent on the part of TT-Line in relation to the outcome, the company did nothing to check whether the horses were correctly individually stalled. She said Williams, who has been working with horses for three decades, failed in his duty to the animals. TT-Line has appealed the guilty ruling in the supreme court of Tasmania. Police charge man over 1992 cold case murder Homicide Squad detectives have today charged a man in relation to the 1992 death of Annette Steward in Geelong West. A 55-year-old man was transported from Western Australia last week and is now in custody in Victoria. He has been charged with murder and will appear at Melbourne magistrates’ court on 20 March. Annette Steward was found dead in her Geelong West property on 18 March 1992 – nearly 30 years ago. In 2015 police offered a $1m reward for information in relation to the 29-year-old’s death. It’s been a huge day, so you don’t want to miss Antoun Issa’s Afternoon Update with a snapshot of today’s biggest stories: Nationals say Labor has dropped ball on kangaroo products industry In some non-Aukus news, the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has accused the government of dropping the ball on footy boots – saying Labor has missed the mark on supporting the nation’s kangaroo products industry. Some context: sports brands Nike and Puma have reportedly announced they won’t use kangaroo leather in their football boots, while several American states are also planning to crackdown on kangaroo products. Littleproud claimed the government had “been missing in action and had failed to fight for the industry”. He alleged that “animal activist” groups had spread “lies” and misinformation about the kangaroo industry. Littleproud said in a statement: Harvesting actually prevents kangaroos from overgrazing, dehydration and starvation. The consequence of Labor’s inaction will be poor animal welfare outcomes and more uncontrolled killing. We know kangaroos can breed easily and are not a threatened species. The practical reality of import bans in the US would be detrimental to kangaroo populations in Australia. Labor accuses Peter Dutton of using Aukus as ‘excuse’ to back NDIS cuts Labor has accused Peter Dutton of backflipping on bipartisan support for the national disability insurance scheme (NDIS) and finding “an excuse” to slash supports, after Dutton linked cuts to funding Aukus nuclear submarines. The government services and NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, made the comments in a statement to Guardian Australia after the opposition leader doubled down on his offer of Coalition support if Labor wanted to make cuts to the program. Shorten responded that “defence spending comes out of the defence budget”: It’s disappointing the Liberals are backflipping on their bipartisan support for the NDIS that the opposition leader committed to in October. What Mr Dutton is making clear to the 575,000 NDIS participants is that the Liberals will always be looking for an excuse to slash their supports. We are committed to reforming the NDIS and making sure every dollar gets to the people who need it most. Shorten said the government would need to “get on top of things like provider fraud and waste” to make the NDIS sustainable, matters to be dealt with by the independent review “which includes an examination of sustainability and costs and will be reporting back by the end of the year”. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has hit back at China’s response to Aukus, insisting that its criticisms of the nuclear-powered submarine deal are “not grounded in fact”. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Wong also signalled that she planned to make further visits to south-east Asia and the Pacific to reassure the region that Australia does not seek to escalate military tensions: The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, is also weighing in on the costings of the Aukus deal, writing on Twitter that “$368 billion could end the social &amp; affordable housing crisis in this country”: Instead, Labor is buying nuclear submarines that won’t make our country safer. There’s always enough money for war &amp; billionaires and never enough for the people who need it. The shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, just appeared on Afternoon Briefing to speak on the costings of the Aukus deal – an estimated $268bn to $368bn, or 0.15% of Australia’s GDP: I was surprised by that figure, because this is such an expensive project we’re undertaking. Rishi Sunak, the UK Prime Minister, in San Diego … committed the UK to 2.5% of GDP. We’ll ask the hard questions. And we’re concerned about the offsets that are being put against other defence programs … We want to know which services will [be] cut, what platforms and programs will be cut and what Australian industry businesses will be affected by the cuts? Dennis Richardson is also asked about China’s accusation the deal is in breach of the non-proliferation treaty. Jennett: Australia, has it got the diplomatic weight to convince the world, as they now must, that it can be a safe partner in this? … Can Australia carry the day without damage to its international standing? Richardson: Yes, we can. Because the non-proliferation treaty from its very beginning envisaged the possibility, separating out nuclear power from nuclear explosions. The president has made it very clear that this is about a nuclear-powered submarine, not a nuclear-armed submarine. I think we have the non-proliferation credentials to carry this globally. I think China is engaging in a bit of empty rhetoric on this front. Indonesia weighs in on Aukus Indonesia’s foreign ministry has just issued the following statement on Aukus. Close watchers of the issue will notice that, while Indonesia again urges Australia to put in place an effective verification mechanism, the statement is warmer than the country’s original response to the original Aukus announcement in 2021. Today’s statement says: Indonesia has been closely following the security partnership of Aukus, particularly the announcement on the pathway to achieve Aukus critical capability. Maintaining peace and stability in the region is the responsibility of all countries. It is critical for all countries to be a part of this effort. Indonesia expects Australia to remain consistent in fulfilling its obligations under the [Non-Proliferation Treaty] and IAEA Safeguards, as well as to develop with the IAEA a verification mechanism that is effective, transparent and non – discriminatory. Now appearing on Afternoon Briefing is former defence department secretary and US ambassador Dennis Richardson. Jennett: Is this a credible plan? Do you see any holes in it? Richardson: Look, it’s certainly a credible plan, Greg. There’s still a lot of detail to fill in, but that is what you’d expect. I think the time frames particularly in terms of acquiring our own nuclear powered submarine in the 40s and credible. A time frame for acquiring the Virginia class in the early mid 30s, that is also credible. But a lot of work to do in the meantime. Greg Jennett (Afternoon Briefing host): How many kilos and how much highly enriched uranium is in a reactor as we move many years from now to having to safely dispose of it? Richard Marles: It’s not going to surprise you for me to [say] that I can’t tell you that, because that ends up being very classified information. But it’s a significant undertaking to deal with the reactors at the end of their life. And this will require a purpose-built facility in order to do that. And we’re talking about the first reactor needing to be dealt with in the 2050s. So this is a long way into the future. But we need to be planning for that. What we’ve made clear today is within the year we will announce a process by which that place will be identified so that we won’t identify the process here but we’ll announce the process for that and what that facility would look like. Staying with the Aukus deal, the defence minister, Richard Marles, is appearing on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing. He is being asked about a tweet in which China’s ambassador to the UN argued the deal is violating the objects and purpose of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty: Asked if he will be attempting to try and dissuade China of that view, Marles said: What we are doing is working with the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] to make sure that we are compliant with our non-proliferation obligations. We said from the outset that was a fundamental precondition from an Albanese government walking down this path and it remains that. The IAEA in turn has made it clear a country running naval nuclear propulsion is not of itself violating non-proliferation obligations. What matters is that you have a complete assuredness and transparent assuredness that the nuclear material is counted for in every moment in time and we can do that because we’re talking about a sealed nuclear reactor … The Greens senator Jordon Steele-John has called the Aukus deal “a fundamental threat to Australian independence” in a series of Tweets published this afternoon. The senator argued that the deal “will undermine the global effort to fight the climate crisis and unleash a regional arms race that only serves to enrich global arms manufacturers”. Ben Doherty and Daniel Hurst have put together a fantastic explainer on the Aukus deal that is well worth a read: Submarines an ‘outrageous assault on peace’, campaigners say Anti-war campaigners have described Australia’s submarine announcement this morning as an “outrageous assault on peace”. Dr Sue Wareham OAM, national president of the Medical Association for Prevention of War, says the decision to spend an “unimaginable” amount of $368bn on naval nuclear reactors represented “one of the lowest points in Australian democracy in living memory”. The naval nuclear reactors for Australia, announced today, represent one of the lowest points in Australian democracy in living memory. Unimaginable expenditure – up to $368bn – has been announced for a single weapons capability, submarines, in a decision that was made behind closed doors and is overflowing with risks, many of which have barely been acknowledged yet. They include very significant risks to health and healthcare for Australians. Prime minister Albanese has betrayed his own people. Vulnerable Australians will suffer even more in order for such largesse to flow to the military-industrial complex. Opposition leader Dutton has already indicated that the NDIS, a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of Australians with particular needs, might need to be attacked. Our healthcare system is in crisis in many areas. Countless thousands of Australians have nowhere to live, and yet our biggest financial investments will be in preparing to join yet another war of choice, this time between the US and China. Circling back to the Aukus deal, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has shared a photo from a meeting with the US president, Joe Biden, following the announcement earlier this morning: Commentary on the deal has continued to filter through on social media this afternoon. First up we have the minister for resources, Madeleine King, speaking on jobs: Labor’s Senator Penny Wong highlighted the investment in South Australia, with the next-generation nuclear-powered submarines to be built at Osborne: Meanwhile, the Greens Senator Janet Rice has spoken out against the deal: As flagged here earlier today, the Bureau of Meteorology has confirmed that the La Nina is over. That was expected because the La Nina had been fading for some time, and other agencies had called its end already. What is a bit of a surprise today, though, is that BoM is shifting straight to a so-called El Nino watch: As the bureau says, oceanic and atmospheric indicators have returned to neutral levels and are likely to remain so through this southern autumn: “However, there are some signs that El Niño could form later in the year,” it says, in explaining the switch. This means there is a 50% chance of an El Niño in 2023. During El Nino years, the equatorial winds that in neutral years blow from east to west tend to stall and ever reverse. Rainfall tends to shift away from eastern Australia (and eastern Indonesia, etc). Droughts, heatwaves and bushfires become a greater risk for large parts of Australia. As BoM is keen to underscore, “an El Niño watch is not a guarantee that El Niño will occur, rather it is an indication that some of the typical precursors of an event are currently observed”. We still have what meteorologists call the autumn “predictability gap” to clear, reflecting the limited accuracy climate models have at this time of year. Still, the switch to a watch mode shows where those models are tilting now. ASX plunges into red for 2023 The local share market has plunged into negative territory for the year as the turmoil from Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse in the United States continues, AAP reported earlier today. At noon, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index had fallen 133.7 points, or 1.88%, to 6,975.1, while the All Ordinaries was down 141 points, or 1.93%, to 7,169.6. The ASX200 tumbled to its lowest level since a 3 January selloff. It is now down one per cent since the start of the year, despite a 6.2% rally in January. The index was also trading below its 200-day moving average, a key technical level. Surge of autumn heat forecast for week ahead A strong surge of autumn heat will make its way across the country in the second half of this week and into the early part of next week, as reported by Weatherzone. The BoM has already forecast above-average temperatures for much of western, southern and south-east Australia from Thursday. Weatherzone has reported that a large pool of hot autumn air will extend from WA’s Pilbara region down to the coastline of western South Australia: In those areas, maximum temperatures in excess of 44°C can be expected … That heat will then drift eastwards, with NSW in the bullseye. Meanwhile, temperatures nearing 40C may be seen in western Sydney on both Thursday and Saturday, with temperatures expected to reach 30C or higher in the days between. UN urges Australia to support global food security Australia is being urged to strengthen its support for global food security and stability in the Pacific, AAP has reported. Delegates from the United Nations’ agriculture finance agency have met foreign affairs and trade officials in Canberra. One of the delegation’s messages was Australians should be worried about food security, both in the region and globally. The agency’s Ron Hartman said: The cost of living is a key concern in developed and developing countries, and the cost of food, particularly healthy, nutritious food, is as much a concern here in Australia as it is for the developing world. We’re here to try and respond to the demand from Pacific islands and other developing member states for more support, not through the handouts type approach, but support in terms of hand-ups. We’re motivated by the concern that we’ve got over-escalating global food insecurity and want to make sure that we’re co-ordinating and partnering with Australian stakeholders as much as possible. The group is in the region for a conference in Fiji. Hartman said world peace and food security were interlinked, and Australians should be aware of what’s happening in the global food space, as well as in the Pacific. We need to be doing more. There’s almost a perfect storm at the moment that is facing the global community. Making sure that Australian expertise, knowledge and innovation is able to benefit those countries that are either less fortunate or more impoverished is really important. Last week, the assistant trade minister, Tim Ayres, warned against Australia taking a narrow focus when negotiating trade agreements. He told a major agricultural conference there was a risk that less-developed nations would be ignored if their interests weren’t considered. Greens propose $200 vouchers to boost live music scene Meanwhile, the NSW Greens are proposing vouchers for the state’s young people in a bid to revive the live music scene. The Greens music spokeswoman Cate Faehrmann says young people could boost the state’s ailing live music sector if given $200 worth of vouchers, in a scheme similar to the government’s popular Dine and Discover program: Music, arts and culture are a major driver of economic activity across NSW and for years these sectors have been treated with contempt by this government. Under the proposal all young people aged between 18 and 25 would be given four $50 vouchers to spend on live music events. The money could be spent on any type of gig, including festivals, DJ sets or small acoustic gigs, as well as international artists. It comes after Labor revealed data showing just 133 live music venues were still operating in NSW, after the COVID-19 pandemic and impact of lockout laws. Creative industries took a battering during the pandemic, losing $130m in revenue, and a number of key live music venues closed for good. There is certainly an appetite for live music in NSW and just last night, international artists Lorde, Florence and the Machine, and Bikini Kill all performed in Sydney. - with AAP Announcements continuing in lead up to NSW election NSW premier Dominic Perrottet and opposition leader Chris Minns are continuing their rounds today, pitching to voters ahead of the NSW election on March 25. Minns was in Sydney’s southwest, announcing Labor’s plan to put 500 early childhood workers on university or diploma scholarships. The $22 million package would provide 500 scholarships over three years of up to $25,000 for bachelor degrees or diplomas, to fund paid professional development leave and to launch a new study into childhood delivery models. Minns said: We know that in NSW early childhood education centres, those with diplomas or a degree is about 45 per cent - in Victoria, it’s above 60 per cent. We’ve been speaking to the peak bodies and they regard this as an essential investment in early childhood education. The announcement was made in the electorate of Liberal-held East Hills - the state’s most marginal electorate after Minns’ own seat of Kogarah. Meanwhile, Perrottet announced $2m in funding for services to help those dealing with miscarriage or the heartbreak of stillbirth. The funds would go towards over-the-phone, in-person and online services for bereaved families. The announcement comes after Perrottet’s wife Helen revealed she had suffered three miscarriages. The mother of seven said she had been working before the first loss and there was little consideration for the “horrific” grief she felt. She told Nine News: They said ‘you can take a week off or whatever but you have to take sick leave. It should be bereavement leave. - with AAP Third encephalitis virus death recorded in Victoria Victoria has recorded its third death from the mosquito-borne Murray Valley encephalitis virus. The health department on Tuesday confirmed the man, aged in his 70s, died earlier this month. Authorities believe he was potentially exposed to infected mosquitoes in the Shire of Campaspe, in Victoria’s north. A spokesperson for the department sent condolences to the man’s family and urged people in affected areas to take caution: People in areas experiencing increased mosquito activity should continue to take steps to protect themselves against mosquito bites – wearing long, loose-fitting, light-coloured clothing, using insect repellents, removing stagnant water around their home, and avoiding the outdoors when mosquitoes are observed, especially at dusk and dawn. Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Japanese encephalitis virus in several LGAs in northern Victoria in recent months. According to the state’s health department, most people infected with Murray Valley encephalitis virus do not have symptoms. When they occur, symptoms may include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and muscle aches, and in serious cases, people can develop meningitis or encephalitis. Flooding expected to ease at Burketown Record major flooding at Burketown in Queensland is expected to be easing, with minor flooding along the Nicholson, Gregory and Leichhardt rivers also easing. The Queensland BoM said that showers and isolated thunderstorms are forecast for the next few days along these catchment areas, but widespread significant rainfall is not expected. Anecdotal information from Burketown suggests the river level was expected to have peaked above the 2011 record flood level of 6.78 metres on Sunday. The river level along the Albert River at Burketown is expected to continue easing slowly over the next few days, but is likely to remain above the major flood level (6.00 m) during Tuesday and Wednesday, possibly longer. The river level is expected to remain elevated through to at least the end of the week. Disability royal commission publishes final progress report The disability royal commission has published its seventh and final progress report, covering the six months from July-December, 2022. The commission’s final report is due to the governor general by 29 September this year. You can read the full report online. Economic news out today is mostly fairly bleak, although it will likely be eclipsed by submarine coverage. Consumers are in a funk and that dim outlook doesn’t look like brightening much as the full impact of the 350 basis-point increase in the Reserve Bank‘s interest rate won’t be felt for a while yet. According to Westpac and the Melbourne Institute, their consumer sentiment index was unchanged at 78.5 in March, holding near its 30-year lows. It’s the second month in a row of a sub-80 reading, a back-to-back result that did not appear during either the Covid shock and the global financial crisis. Westpac’s chief economist Bill Evans said: Runs of sub-80 reads have only been seen during the late 1980s/early 1990s recession and in the ‘banana republic’ period of concern in 1986, when the Australian dollar was in free-fall after the federal government lost its triple-A rating. ANZ and Roy Morgan’s weekly gauge of consumer confidence, meanwhile, slumped to its lowest level since April 2020, after the RBA announced a 25bp increase in the cash rate in March. Slightly curious numbers, though, had people with a mortgage improving their outlook although they are still the least confident of the housing cohorts. On the other hand, those who own their home outright and renters reported sharp decreases of 4.1pts and 7.9pts, respectively. Inflation expectations also picked up in the survey. Modestly more upbeat, though, was NAB‘s latest monthly survey of business confidence and conditions. True, business confidence fell back below zero in February, continuing a recent period of volatility. But business conditions remained strong with little change in the elevated levels of key subcomponents including trading conditions and employment, NAB said. The bank said: Conditions remain elevated across industries and states, with consumer-facing sectors clustered at a high level of around +20 index points and business-facing sectors clustered around +10 index points. Could consumers merely be grumpy but still spending regardless? Labour-cost growth, meanwhile, picked up further from a brief low of 2.1% in December to be running at 2.8% in quarterly terms, NAB said. NAB’s chief economist Alan Oster said: Business conditions remained at a very high level in the history of the survey in February. Overall, the survey confirms the ongoing resilience of the economy through the first months of 2023, though we continue to expect a more material slowdown in demand later in the year when the full effect of rate rises has passed through. That almost sounds cheery ... unless, of course, there’s fallout from failing US banks or some unhappy response from China – our biggest trade partner by far - over that much-talked about subs deal. Motorcyclist collides with emu in WA national park A motorcyclist is in hospital with serious injuries after colliding with an emu in the Kalbarri national park, WA police have confirmed. The collision reportedly occurred just before 8am this morning. The man was rushed to Kalbarri hospital by St John WA, and it is understood that the national park, north of Geraldton, is currently closed. Exclusion zone in Queensland town lifted An emergency exclusion zone at Warwick, Queensland overnight has been revoked by police after a man was found dead inside a property. Last night, police were called to a Warwick property following reports a man was observed with a firearm. No shots were fired and no threats were made, according to Queensland police, however an exclusion zone was declared to ensure community safety. Around 8am this morning, police entered a residence where a 38-year-old man was found deceased. The exclusion zone was lifted shortly afterwards. A report will be prepared for the coroner, and the man’s death is not being treated as suspicious. This was the second emergency declaration in Queensland in recent days, with a separate man found dead in a residence near Townsville yesterday following a ten-hour standoff with police. Residents were warned to stay inside and lock their doors. Lifeline 13 11 14 / Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636 MPs chosen for Victoria’s duck hunting inquiry Both an Animal Justice party MP and a member of the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party will sit on an inquiry into the future of duck shooting in Victoria. Guardian Australia has been provided with a list of MPs chosen to sit on the select committee, which was announced at the same time the government approved a shortened duck hunting season last month, in response to the “increasingly contested” nature of the sport. They include Animal Justice party MP, Georgie Purcell, a vocal critic of duck hunting, as well as Shooters, Fishers and Farmers MP, Jeff Bourman, who supports the sport. Greens MP Katherine Copsey, Labor’s Sheena Watt, Ryan Batchelor and Michael Galea, Liberals Bev McArthur and Evan Mullholland and Nationals MP Melina Bath round out the committee. Bath last week branded the inquiry a “charade”, as she believed it was a “foregone conclusion” that the Andrews government will ban duck hunting. The committee is expected to hold hearings to listen to the views of hunting, animal welfare and regional community groups, before publishing its final report by 31 August. Oscar winner crowned Miss Moomba in 1984 Yesterday there was a ton of buzz around the 95th Academy Awards in Los Angeles, particularly the film Everything, Everywhere All At Once – which absolutely swept the awards. Among them was the best actress Oscar, awarded to Michelle Yeoh for her role in the film. Now, archival footage has been published showing the award-winning actress’ connection to Australia. In 1984, she won a beauty pageant at Melbourne’s Moomba festival and was crowned Miss Moomba. Sydney train disruptions continue Sydneysiders have been hit with even more train delays today. A warning urging commuters to “allow plenty of extra travel time” was given after urgent signalling work at Broadmeadow and train repairs on the north shore line at Waitara caused delays across the network, Elias Visontay is reporting. The new disruptions follow the network-wide shutdown last Wednesday which left every train parked for 90 minutes. Meanwhile, reports have emerged that an internal Transport for NSW document from more than a year ago warned that Sydney trains’ digital radio system components were “obsolete” and fixing the problem was a priority. Labor’s transport spokesperson Jo Haylen said: The Liberal government was warned a year ago that components in the digital train radio system were already obsolete. They knew that this could put the whole train network at risk but not enough has been done because there is no accountability. Passengers are yet again paying the price because no one knows who is in charge. Following the recent disruptions, train drivers are reportedly going to get analogue hand-held radios as a backup in case communications are temporarily severed again. Thank you to Amy for taking us through the morning- and what a massive morning it was! After the Aukus announcement and all the subsequent commentary, let’s take a step back at some of the headlines you might have missed this morning: Overnight, King Charles delivered his first Commonwealth Day message as monarch from the pulpit at Westminster Abbey - a departure from previous messages from Queen Elizabeth II, which were traditionally pre-recorded. You can read his speech in full here. Independent MPs Allegra Spender and Zali Steggall are pushing the government to include an absolute cap or an explicit objective that emissions must come down under the safeguard mechanism. Vast tracts of Queensland’s northwest remain flooded as communities face a long wait to return to their homes and assess the damage, AAP reports. Residents desperate to begin the massive clean-up have been urged to be cautious, with a number of saltwater crocodiles spotted near inundated towns. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warned there would be heavy stock losses, and three-quarters of the houses in Burketown have water over the floorboards. Meanwhile, the New South Wales Liberal party’s candidate for Swansea, Megan Anderson, has downplayed a comment she made denying climate change last week, calling it a “clumsy joke”. We’ll continue to bring you the latest as the day continues. Thank you to everyone for joining me this morning as we made our way through that tsunami of information. I am going to hand you over to Emily Wind now for the next little bit. I’ll be back when parliament resumes next week. Take care of you. While we’re on the topic of China, Guardian Australia understands Australian officials contacted their counterparts in Beijing yesterday to offer a briefing on the Aukus plans, and that offer stands. More broadly, Australian officials have been carrying out an extensive process of briefing countries in south-east Asia and the Pacific, some of which have shared the concerns about Aukus fuelling an arms race. Australia has sought to reassure countries of the strategic rationale for the submarine plans, and the commitment not to have nuclear weapons. Scott Morrison has responded to the Aukus agreement announcement on Instagram: I commend the government and welcome the announcements made today that take the first steps to realising the historic Aukus agreement we conceived and established in government eighteen months ago in September 2021. The initiatives announced today are appropriately ambitious and consistent with the original aspiration, direction and intentions of the Aukus founders. These bold initiatives will pose significant challenges for all parties, but especially Australia. Such challenges and demands were understood and envisaged when we put Aukus together. It was always going to require a transformative national effort. These challenges will be addressed by governments from both sides of politics for decades to come as they each do their part to steward this great initiative. I have no doubt this will continue in a strong spirit of bipartisanship and national unity. Aukus is bigger than any one individual, party, government or partner nation. Aukus has already altered the strategic calculus of the Indo-Pacific and will only continue to do so in the years ahead, supporting an enduring strategic balance in our region. I particularly commend and thank all those within our defence and security services from all three nations who have worked so diligently as part of this eighteen month process that was initiated when we commenced Aukus . They have kept to the mission and produced a great result. Congratulations. China’s mission to the United Nations has criticised the Aukus announcement, arguing it is a “blatant act” that “hurts peace and stability in the region”. On Twitter, the Chinese diplomatic mission repeated Beijing’s longstanding claims - denied by Australia - that the agreement violates the objects of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). And it argued this “textbook case of double-standard will damage the authority and effectiveness of the international non-proliferation system”: The irony of #AUKUS is that two nuclear weapons states who claim to uphold the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard are transferring tons of weapons-grade enriched uranium to a non-nuclear-weapon state, clearly violating the object and purpose of the NPT. [END QUOTE] The Australian government has repeatedly pointed out its plans don’t breach the NPT. The three Aukus governments, pre-empting the criticism that China was likely to mount, said in their joint statement that they would “continue to work transparently” with the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure the “strongest non-proliferation precedent”. The Aukus statement said: As a non-nuclear-weapon state, Australia does not – and will not – seek to acquire nuclear weapons; Australia will not enrich uranium or reprocess spent fuel as part of this program; Australia will not produce its own nuclear fuel for its [nuclear-powered submarines]; The United Kingdom and United States intend to provide Australia with nuclear material in complete, welded power units that will not require refuelling during their lifetime; The nuclear fuel that Australia receives cannot be used in nuclear weapons without further chemical processing, which would require facilities that Australia does not have and will not seek; and This initiative will occur within the framework of Australia’s Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (CSA) and Additional Protocol (AP) with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Why doesn’t Jim Chalmers extend the deal beyond 2027? Chalmers: There’s a fair bit to do between now and then. Four years away, when the deal was done, with our support, to give Western Australia its fair share of GST revenue, we proudly supported that deal. We have implemented in government. It’s meant that we have funded to multiple billions of dollars the other states to ensure that they aren’t worse off. They know and you know that when the deal was first struck, there was a review built into it which is still some years away. We’ll turn our minds to it at the appropriate time. You can tell the treasurer is in WA because most of the questions in this press conference is about the GST arrangement. Chalmers is asked about comments from the Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, that the WA GST arrangement isn’t equitable: Chalmers: I say to Treasurer Pallas, he’s a friend of mine, someone who I have a heap of respect for, the GST deal ensures no state is worse off including Victoria. And that’s the deal that we committed to. This is the undertaking we have given here in WA on multiple occasions. I don’t think I have been in WA in the last couple of years without being asked about it. And it’s an important opportunity for me to respond to some of the absolute rubbish that Michaelia Cash and others have been saying in recent days. Today, the Commonwealth Grants Commission releases the new relatives for the GST allocation and I’m proud to say and pleased to say that instead of getting the ten cents in the dollar that WA would have been entitled to under the old regime – its lowest ever – WA will be getting 70 cents in the dollar and the difference between that is $5.6 billion next year. This is a deal that we are committed to, this is a deal that we are proud of, this is a deal that ensures that we recognise that the Western Australian economy often keeps the world - wheels of the national economy turning. This is a $5.6 billion thank you to the people of Western Australia for keeping the wheels of the national economy turning, not just in recent times, but before that as well. I have said the premier McGowan and treasurer McGowan, I said publicly and privately here in WA, we don’t intend to change that deal. The Liberals are lying when they say that is the case. There are regular reviews which happen all of the time and to treasurer Pallas and other friends and treasurers around the Australia, the current arrangements ensure that even as WA gets this funding that they deserve the other states aren’t worse off OK cool, but we are rethinking the stage-three tax cuts right? Right? Jim Chalmers: Our position on the tax cuts hasn’t changed. We’ve made it clear in other ways that we do need to find ways to make the budget more sustainable over time. You know, the very modest but meaningful change that we announced a couple of weeks ago for example to superannuation, will make the budget a bit more sustainable over time. But we’ve got those five big pressures on the budget - defence is one of those. This is necessary spending. And we need to make sure that we can find ways to make the budget more sustainable more broadly. So the stage-three tax cuts are part of that? Our position on the tax cuts hasn’t changed. How is Australia going to pay for it? Jim Chalmers: Well, Australia can’t afford not to do this. And this is a key investment. It’s a big investment. But it’s an important investment which will deliver huge returns for our country, for our nation’s security and for its economy. In offsetting $9 billion over the forward estimates, we are not adding to the substantial pressure which is already on the budget. Beyond that, we’ve already got the $24 billion attack class provision as the beginnings of offsetting what we can from the $50 billion to $58 billion cost over the coming decade. We know that we’ve got substantial pressures on the budget. The big five fastest growing areas of spending on the budget are the interest costs on the Liberals’ $1 trillion debt that we inherited, the NDIS, aged-care, healthcare and defence. What we’ve shown here is an ability to offset the cost of this over the forward estimates, partially offset the cost beyond that, but this is a game-changing investment. It will be worth every cent. When it comes to our national security, our national economy and the local economy of WA. The treasurer Jim Chalmers is now speaking on the Aukus agreement from WA: This is a big investment we’re announcing today but it has big returns as well. I talked about the $8 billion over 10 years in WA, $1 billion of that in the forward estimates, thousands of jobs for Western Australia and for the nation beyond. The forward estimate cost of the whole program is $9 billion over the forward estimates. That will be completely offset by defence, so that the combination of the $6 billion provision for the attack class plus $3 billion of additional offsets will mean that over the forward estimates this plan won’t add to the deficits over the four years of the forward estimates. The ten-year cost is between $50 billion and $58 billion. Included or part of the offset for that will be the existing $24 billion provision for the attack class. Over the life of the project, it will cost an average of 0.15% of GDP. That will average over the life of the project until the middle 2050s. Today is not a day for partisan politics but it’s important to recognise what we provisioned in our budget is more substantial than our predecessors provisioned in theirs. The costs we’re announcing today included some of the costs our predecessors did not provision for when it comes to sustainment and training and some of the other important elements of the cost that we are talking about today. We’re being up-front about the cost of this. It is a big cost but it will deliver big returns for our national security and national economy and here in Western Australia as well. To some other news now It’s been a long time coming but the Bureau of Meteorology is later today likely to formally declare an end to the La Niña event in the Pacific. Conditions have been slowly drifting back to neutral conditions in the central equatorial Pacific for some time and the La Niña itself was never a very extreme one to start with. Still, the fact that we had three La Niña years in a row meant that a lot of catchments were sodden to start with and it didn’t need record-breaking rain to trigger big floods. (Of course, we did have some record falls too.) The US National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration - which uses slightly different measures from our BoM - called an end to the La Niña last week. Attention has been switching for some time to the prospect of La Niña’s opposite - an El Niño - forming in the Pacific later in the year. The models used by BoM continue to point in that direction at least for now. La Niñas favour wetter than average conditions for much of Australia, and El Niños tilt conditions the other way. We won’t know for a couple of months whether an El Nino is certain but we can expect drier and hotter weather with the related risks of bushfires and heatwaves rather than floods. Still, as we’ve seen in the Gulf region this week it’s still possible to get huge floods even with a waning La Niña. It’s early days yet, but meteorologists will also be watching out for a late-season tropical cyclone (or two), with the possibility of one forming in the Coral Sea next week. Meanwhile, many parts of eastern Australia might have felt as if summer had passed them by. That could change in coming days with an extended spell of heat for parts of NSW in particular, with conditions even reaching ‘severe heatwave’ levels for parts of the state’s south coast. Let’s hope the burst of warmth is not a precursor for what’s ahead next summer, whether or not an El Niño forms. Winner of the 2017 Nobel peace prize, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican), has said that Australia’s decision to buy and build nuclear-powered submarines using highly-enriched uranium is both a major proliferation risk and could be seen internationally as a precursor to Australia acquiring nuclear weapons. Ican argues that he “clearest signal that Australia could send to our region and the world” it does not intend to acquire nuclear weapons would be to sign the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons: the ban treaty that Ican has championed and to which 68 states around the world are now a party. Australia’s acquisition of submarines fuelled by HEU undermines our commitment to non-proliferation. It goes against Australia’s past support and actions to reduce use and stocks of HEU, and negates Australia’s support for a proposed Fissile Material Cutoff treaty. The particular capability of the planned submarines is to support the US in a war in northeast Asia. Whether with China, North Korea or Russia, there is an alarming risk of any such war escalating to use of nuclear weapons. Nuclear-powered submarines, and their bases, would become high priority targets for conventional or nuclear attack from adversaries. We don’t need to escalate regional tensions with highly-enriched uranium powered submarines. If Australia acquires nuclear-powered submarines it must unequivocally commit never to develop nuclear weapons, nor host another nation’s nuclear weapons. These are red lines we must not cross. The most effective assurance we can give would be to sign and ratify the UN TPNW.” The Coalition’s official response has been released: The Coalition welcomes the government’s announcement of the next step in the Aukus partnership established by the Coalition government in 2021. The concept of Aukus was first conceived by prime minister Morrison in 2019 with the development process commenced in 2020. Today’s announcement is an endorsement of the Coalition’s decision to pursue the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines. It affirms the Coalition’s defence and national security strategy by enshrining the Aukus partnership as the centrepiece of our nation’s defence. The Aukus partnership will play a vital role in sustaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region for generations to come. The Coalition will continue to seek further details regarding the prime minister’s announcement today, but will provide bipartisan support for the acquisition of nuclear powered submarines, which will radically transform Australia’s ability to defend ourselves and uphold our shared interests in preserving stability and peace for all nations in our region. We firmly believe that the Aukus endeavour is too important to fail. Aukus is a multi-generational nation-building task, commenced by the Coalition 18 months ago. Today represents the continuation of that task, as our country commences development of the SSN Aukus. Aukus would not be possible, if the Coalition had not demonstrated Australia’s commitment to boosting our sovereign shipbuilding capabilities to our allies by commissioning the domestic build and upgrade of more than 70 vessels, and increased defence spending to over 2% of GDP, from its low ebb under Labor in 2013 of 1.56%. While the purchase of the Virginia class vessels from the United States is a solution which we have advocated for some time, we call on the government to guarantee that this decision will result in no net job losses in South Australia or Western Australia in the short or medium term. But we must be under no illusion that the pathway presented to us by the Albanese government is high risk and the government must provide surety that the risks in operating three classes of submarines is a feat which can be managed. The Coalition is calling on the government to have a frank and honest conversation with Australians about the significant investment this decision represents to the national budget, and defence spending. This includes being upfront about what defence capabilities are being cut by $3 billion over the next four years to offset our contribution to US and UK submarine production. The Coalition also acknowledges that this agreement remains true to Australia’s commitments to not acquire nuclear weapons and our obligations as a signatory to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone treaty, and remains consistent with our position to nuclear non-proliferation. We welcome all three nations’ deep commitment to upholding leadership on global non-proliferation. So that seems to be all the immediate reactions to the official Aukus submarine announcement. Obviously there will be more reaction and responses to come. China is not going to be thrilled with it. Stay tuned over the coming days (weeks/months/years) as that reaction rolls out. We’ll bring you what else happens today on that announcement, as well as the other news of the day. For a run-down of the submarine deal: Did Peter Dutton know that Australia was going to take the nuclear waste? Dutton: I’ll let the deputy prime minister talk more about that. I think there’s more that we’ve been briefed on that I don’t think is publicly available at the moment … In our country we have to have a sensible, mature debate about nuclear energy and the disposal of it. We dispose of nuclear waste now in our country. … we dispose of it safely. We’ve got we’ve got terms of where we sit on the map, we have an incredibly stable environment to store nuclear waste. The Labor party signed up to Aukus knowing that they would have to deal with the waste. And now that they’re in government, they know they’re part of the deal. Was that undertaking part of the deal when Dutton was in government? Well, I’m not going into the detail other than to say the Americans demanded nuclear stewardship to be first and foremost and part of that is to develop a domestic industry, which the government, to their credit, is doing. That’s what we’d always envisaged under Aukus. And you need to dispose of the waste sensibly and the government will outline that policy. And the Coalition won’t be playing politics on that. Q: The deputy prime minister declined to say this morning where the $3b of cuts in the defence program will be coming from. Have they failed at the first test of transparency? And secondly, was it a mistake for you last night to single out the NDIS as somewhere where the Coalition could help find savings? Don’t those programs deserve to be judged on their merits? Peter Dutton: Well, of course they do. I’ll refer you to what I said in my budget reply speech in October. The opposition is prepared to work with the government if they’ve got changes to make. The NDIS is an incredibly important program. We supported it in opposition, in government, and it must continue but it must be sustainable. The government itself has pointed out difficulties around the sustainability and the cost trajectory. The last thing you want to do is have an important program like that, which is crucial to provide dignity and support to people with disabilities, that is financially unviable. And if they need to pass legislation, I’ve said nothing different than what I said in October of last year. In aged care, I think there are significant investment decisions that the government needs to make to make that policy sustainable and if there’s legislation required to give more dignity to people as they age as well, then we’re will to support that through the Senate. If the government can’t get the support of the Greens. So there are sensible debates that we need to have, but there are only three options available to the Government here. They can find savings in the budget, go into debt or, you know, what else is available? Peter Dutton then says the Coalition is committed to the Aukus agreement: I want to give this commitment to the Australian people today that come hell or high water, the Coalition will support Aukus. We were the authors of it. We give full credit to the government for continuing it and arriving at today. Regardless of the next election, if the Coalition is successful or not, Aukus will continue and it must because the times demand it and we will provide support to the government when we’re in Opposition and when we’re in government, we expect the support from the Labor party as well and I believe it will be forthcoming. I’ve worked with the Obama administration, with the Trump administration, and with the Biden administration and I can tell you in relation to national security matters, it’s completely seamless. The commitment of the Republicans and the Democrats, the Labor party and the Coalition has underpinned the Five Eyes relationship and the alliance between Australia and the United States for decades and it must into the future. We’re a population of 25.8 million people and we have to ... if we’re trying to project every scenario over the course of the next century, it’s impossible to see in any of those difficult scenarios where you can be a sole trader. You need to have that relationship with a trusted partner in the US and the UK. Canada, New Zealand, India, Japan, many others in the region now as well. It’s very important that those relationships continue so I do share the government’s optimism. Would Dutton support a deferral of the stage-three tax cuts? Well, the government went to the last election with a commitment for the tax cuts and they knew about Aukus. Aukus was something that they received in their lap from the Coalition, and they knew about the expenses in relation to Aukus and they knew about Treasury and Finance from day one and still made a commitment to the tax cuts. If they’re going to walk away from the tax cuts, then they should be very clear about that and we’ll no doubt find that out in the budget. Where does Peter Dutton think the money should come from, if not defence? The government has a budget coming up in May, so no doubt they’ll detail some of this, if they can identify savings within the budget. They’ll do that, no doubt. If proposing new taxes or reduction of debt they’ll do that. They’re the government and they’ll no doubt provide all of that detail to you. I think the most important thing here is we need to achieve the capability given the circumstances we’re in at the moment and everybody agrees that with that. That’s why we started Aukus negotiations in the first place. It needs to be done at the least possible cost in the quickest time possible. That’s what the government will lay out. At the moment, listening to some of the rhetoric this morning, I think there’s a magic pudding episode going on here that somehow, the money is going to appear or it will be cost-neutral. This is not a cost-neutral decision and the government should be clear to the Australian public about that. And appropriately, the money is being spent because the times demand it. This is the most significant undertaking in our country’s history. We need to be transparent with the Australian public that there is a cost attached to it because we want to preserve peace in our region and we want to provide stability and country for our near neighbours and for our region. To the questions for Peter Dutton (and shadow defence minister Andrew Hastie) Q: You talk about about not cutting elsewhere in defence, but is it not the case there’s always a fair bit of fat around in defence that some savings could be found without halving operational capabilities and capacities. Dutton: I’m sure there is some savings and the government can detail that. But for example when we from were in government we put just under $10b into the Australian Signals Directorate. Long before there is any kinetic action, and any, you know, possible scenario into the future or naval blockades or whatever it is that people are talking about, you’re likely to see cyber attacks. And – cyberattacks and denial of service is here, attacks on our infrastructure, all of that is the reality. And so you need to make sure for example that they’re not going to strip money out of space, which is an incredibly important element of the government’s defences, not just in sea and land, but in the virtual world and space that we need to be careful of our capacities and capabilities and again, I think it’s important that the government is planning to strip money out of defence, it’s important they outline that and what needs to be prioritised and what it means for local companies and defence manufacturers here in Australia that are part of that important supply chain. Opposition leader queries Labor’s lack of commitment to east-coast base Peter Dutton also has questions over why the government won’t commit to an east coast submarine base: There is obviously a significant question-mark hanging over the government’s commitment to the east coast base and the deputy prime minister has been clear about that this morning. I suspect what is happening here is that they’re delaying an announcement on that until after the New South Wales state election. I think the Labor party, frankly, at the moment, is talking out of both sides of their mouth in relation to the east coast base and they might see that as a saving so why wouldn’t they commit to it when they’ve committed to WA and to South Australia? Because that was an important part of the original considerations. It was also an important part of trying to attract a workforce on the east coast. And this was clear advice from Navy at the time. Most people want to live in WA but not everybody wants to live on the west coast and the idea of increasing the workforce without a base on the east coast from a Navy advice perspective was difficult. So it was to augment the workforce in the west and to attract people into being a submariner which is obviously an incredibly important part of delivering the Aukus program. Here is what Paul Karp gave you a taste of a little earlier – Dutton talking about the cost transparency: We have to make sure that there is transparency and honesty with the Australian people about the cost involved in Aukus. It’s not credible for the government to say that there’s no net impact, even over the forward estimates. We can’t allow Labor to cannibalise the defence force to pay for Aukus. It’s not an either/or option. Let’s be very clear - when Labor was last in government, they reduced spending by 10.5% in real terms which brought spending down to 1.5% of GDP in defence. We built that up from the day we were elected to come in at 2% or just over 2% and that put us in a credible position to do this deal with the United States and the United Kingdom. There’s no way in the world if you were spending $10 billion a year less in defence that United States or UK would have seen us as credible partners in the construction or delivery of the nuclear-powered submarines. That’s very clear and we can’t allow Labor to go back to a circumstance where they’re going to cannibalise Army or Navy or Air Force to pay for this. So there is an honest conversation that the government has to have. There’s no magic pudding. There’s no way in which you can sugar-coat it. There is extra money that needs to be spent in defence and the United Kingdom has been honest about this, as you saw with prime minister Sunak’s announcement to increase their spending to 2.5% of GDP. So that is incredibly important and you will require a lot of detail from the government in the run-up to the May budget not just in the forward estimates but into the out years as well. I think this is an important part of the conversation. OK, after a press conference about how excited South Australia is, featuring the SA premier and Penny Wong, we move to Peter Dutton in the conga-line of press conferences being held across two time zones today. Thanks for sticking with us as we work through all this information for you. Dutton: This is a necessary decision that’s been taken by the government and Aukus is a huge achievement. It’s been five years, or four years in the making. It’s been quite a remarkable endeavour, across three countries over that period of time. Dutton goes through his list of people to thank, which of course includes former prime minister, Scott Morrison. Peter Dutton is speaking on the announcement – but he has questions on the cost neutrality of the agreement over the first four years: Military spending shows poverty is a political choice: Antipoverty Centre The cost is a conversation Australians will need to be prepared to have, for decades. And the cost of that cost on other services and opportunities. One of the reasons we have heard (repeatedly and across both major political parties) that we can’t afford to raise welfare rates is because Australia can’t afford it. And yet it seems Australia can afford things, when it chooses to. The Antipoverty Centre has responded on that point: The government has proven that poverty is a political choice with its latest military spending announcement. $368 billion for five submarines over 30 years we can afford. Keeping people housed, fed and the supports they need to survive? Apparently we can’t afford. People are struggling to keep a roof over their heads as major parties prioritise investors over single parents keeping their kids housed and in school. Neither party will even dare to consider investing in increasing our public housing waitlist for the ever growing list. People are starving themselves to feed their children as the cost of living soars and both major parties are on a unity ticket to keep tax cuts for the wealthy. Yet Labor won’t take extremely modest action to rein in the most extreme tax breaks for large super accounts until after the next election – if they win. ‘We have no choice’ but to pay cost of Aukus subs: Joe Hockey The ABC just played a little from former US ambassador (and treasurer) Joe Hockey’s interview on ABC radio RN Breakfast this morning about the cost of the submarine agreement. He said Australia has no option but to pay: Well, we have no choice. We have no choice. When it comes to defending national security. You have to allocate a certain amount of money. We increased it when we came into government in 2013. Q: But this is a dramatic increase. I don’t know if it is, actually. Peter Dutton will be responding on behalf of the opposition very soon. ‘We’re talking about nuclear power, not nuclear weapons’, Biden emphasises again Joe Biden’s remarks are a lot shorter: I think everything you said about it is accurate. I want to point out one other thing – I want the world to understand – you and I fully understand, as well as the prime minister of Great Britain – that we’re talking about nuclear power, not nuclear weapons. It’s critical that the world understands that and we work with the IAEA, they sign off … on what we’re doing. And I look forward to coming down there. Albanese: It will be fun, too. The questions from the media begin in earnest. That part of the meeting isn’t shown (it will be a little later). Aukus is an economic plan as well as defence and security plan, PM says Back to the US now, and Anthony Albanese and Joe Biden are holding one of those awkward meetings where they say nice things about each other in front of the cameras. Albanese: We look forward to welcoming you down in Australia for the Quad meeting in May. I’m sure it will be a very successful visit and this is our fourth meeting in, I haven’t yet been prime minister for a year – so, we’ve been in very regular contact and developed a personal friendship and relationship of trust, as well, which is something that should be there between our two great nations. And today what we’ve really done is just to demonstrate a next chapter in our history together. John Curtin, one of my great Labor prime minister predecessors during World War II, said famously, ‘We turn to America, we look to America in our time of need.’ And ever since then, we have stood side by side and today, I think, is very important, very significant, that you have agreed for just the second time in history to share this technology. And I think it will make a difference in advancing security and stability in the region. But also we, of course, share a common interest in rebuilding manufacturing in our respective countries. And we see this is a very much an economic plan, not just a defence and security plan. This hi-tech manufacturing capacity that we’re building will be really important going forward. When we talk about national security, we have shared your language about climate change being a national security issue as well which is of course the entry ticket into credibility in the Pacific in particular. We have spent our first year in office really rebuilding relationships in the region based upon our action on climate change. Your inflation reduction act is the most significant piece of legislation ever on climate. We’re trying to also deal with the challenge which is there. We so much look forward to welcoming you and Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Kishida down to Australia in just a couple of months now. And then I look forward to being at Apec as well, you’re hosting that later this year. So we’re going to see a lot of each other on an ongoing basis. Biden says “that’s a very good thing”. Albanese agrees. Transparency has been welcomed by regional leaders, defence minister says Australia has made 60 or so phone calls to regional leaders to talk through the agreement and any concerns. Is that enough? Richard Marles says: I’m really loath to get myself into a space where I’m speaking on behalf of other countries. So ultimately, you’re asking how are they reacting? I’ll ultimately leave it for them to give that reaction. I’d simply say that an awful lot of effort has gone in here. You know, we have done a lot of diplomacy, and the foreign minister has led that. We feel like we’re in the best position we can be in, in terms of the acceptance of our neighbours and the world of the decision that we are making. I can say that in terms of the conversations I’ve had, and I think Pat would be the same, and I’ve spoken with both Penny [Wong] and the prime minister – they’ve all been pretty constructive calls. We’ve all been very comforted by the sorts of conversations that we’ve had. And I think the effort that we have put in, in relation to providing transparency here to our neighbours and to our friends, has been welcomed. But it is ultimately a matter for them to provide the definite reaction, obviously. Pat Conroy: I think Richard is absolutely right. And it’s not for me to speak on behalf of the leaders of the Pacific. I just make [ two points]; they have generally welcomed the opportunity to be briefed ahead of the announcement. The gesture of that is very important. Operating in a transparent and respectful manner is critical, and I think it’s something that this government is very committed to. Secondly, our emphasis on the fact that what we’re doing is completely consistent with the treaty of Rarotonga is there and everything is consistent with it and the commitment to non-nuclear proliferation. ‘There is no decision about an east coast base’: Marles Where will the east coast submarine base be? Marles says people need to chill: I’m aware that there’s been a lot of conjecture about this particularly in certain parts of the east coast. Let me say this – I think everybody who is engaged in that needs to take a very deep breath. This is a long way into the future. There is no decision about an east coast base which forms part of the decision that we have announced today. It is the case that the former government announced the need for an east coast base, but we are taking our time here, and all of that is a long way into the future. ‘Sovereign Australian workforce’ to be trained to build submarines: Conroy Pat Conroy says building up Australia’s capability also includes building up the workforce: The simple answer is, we’re going to train Australians to do this. As I said, apprentices starting their training today could work on this project for their entire working life. We’re going to be training Australians to do this and we’re confident that we’re investing now to deliver that. We’ve talked about – there might need to be some discussions around visa arrangements to facilitate workers from Australia working on US and UK submarines and vice versa. But as Richard said, at the end of this Aukus process, we need to go from three construction yards across the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States able to make nuclear submarines to four – ie Adelaide. And part of that is having a sovereign Australian workforce that is part of that industrial capability. That’s our plan. We’ll look at visa arrangements if we need to, around facilitating work experience and plugging gaps. But we’ll be training Australians to do this job. Sovereignty not compromised by sharing defence tech, Marles says Australia will not provide its own nuclear fuel for the submarines. What does that mean for our sovereignty? Marles: This has been an important part of the consideration that is we’ve had in relation to how we have structured all of this. Sovereignty has been totally central to the decisions that we’ve made. We want the best sovereign outcome that we can possibly have. Now, when we think about sovereignty with defence platforms generally, people need to understand, as I’m sure everyone does, that we often import technology of various kinds to operate within our defence platforms, from around the world. From the US, but in fact, from around the world. So defence forces generally now around the world use shared technologies. And there is a sovereignty implementation to that if you compare it to times past where everything was being made and developed within one country. That’s just not the world in which we live today. But a sealed nuclear reactor which will exist for the life of the submarine itself is an excellent sovereign outcome. Because it doesn’t need to be refuelled. In other words, we get the reactor and it’s there, and it’s there until the end. And it does offer the opportunity for us to do the full maintenance of the submarine during the life of the submarine. And so, you’re seeing through the sovereignty lens, this is as good an outcome as you would want and it stands very much on par with the kind of sovereignty outcomes that we get through the importation of other technology and other defence platforms. Marles confident in agreement’s future in event of political change in America Richard Marles says he is confident that the agreement will hold, even if America has a change in political direction: I kind of don’t want to delve into a critique or an analysis of the lineage of American politic and where it might go. I think that the point really to make is this – if you look across the history of American politic, across all of the lineages – throughout all of that, the alliance with Australia has been strong. That’s point one. Point two is if you look across the existing Congress today and the Biden Administration is doing exactly that right now in order to win the approval for those aspects of the arrangement which needs congressional approval, they are finding support across the political spectrum. Both of those facts give me a sense of confidence about the future and how this will work. And you know, I mean, America … The American alliance is very central to our worldview. I’ve said, repeatedly, that I don’t think that the American alliance has been more important than it is now in terms of the period since the end of the second world war. I say that in respect of the security guarantee that we get by virtue of that alliance. But the technology sharing aspect of our relationship is also fundamentally important. And I have complete confidence that that will endure. Richard Marles has not been involved in any briefing with China. He says he is unaware of any response to the offer. Q: When did buying the Virginia class emerge? Recent months or pre-election? Marles: It’s not pre-election. Q: Can you expand on that, and I ask the admiral the same question? Well, this has emerged since coming to office. One of the critical points that was in one of the very early conversations that I had with the admiral was the need to get the capability yesterday. You know, as soon as possible! That what we faced was a capability gap. And that whilst the life of type extension of Collin was an answer, it could not be the complete answer, because we all understand the diminishing nature of the capability of a diesel-electric submarine, and as I described to you on background, the ability for the process of snorting to be detected. So from that point of view, we made it really clear that we need a solution earlier than the early 2040s. And it’s really one of the big breakthroughs that Admiral Mead has been able to achieve since the election, to get to a point where we are now having the ability to operate an Australian-flagged vessel in the early 2030s … with nuclear-powered submarines operating from Australia, really in the next few years, you know, from 2027. And that will be a big step forward in terms of the capability in our country. V Adm Mead: You know, this work that we do with the Aukus partners over the last 18 months was an evolutionary process. We brought together the US and UK and we looked at a range of options and scenarios that could address those premises of enduring capability, how to close the capability gap, adhere to the NPT, how to do it safely and securely. Over many months, we worked this, we went over to US. We went over to UK. They came over here. We had something like 13 major in situ meetings of 50 or 60 people together. The ultimate pathway that we put forward with the Virginias rotating out of Western Australia – we actually see that as a very elegant pathway into having sovereign control of our own Virginias and then the Virginias obviously addressing the capability gap. And then also, as a pathway to leading into SSN-Aukus. Each step, which is really an indevisible step sees it out to the 2040s and 2050s. ‘There wouldn’t be much of an overlap’ between last Collins-class and first SSN-Aukus subs, Marles says Q: Is it possible that we’ll be maintaining and operating three classes of submarines? That is the Virginia, the Collins and the Aukus submarines? And if so, is there any concern? And can I ask the admiral as well, is there any concern in defence about the prospect of operating three different submarines? Marles: We obviously will be operating two as a result of this announcement. You know, the preference is to operate as few classes as possible. This is the step that we have needed to take in order to close the capability gap. We can’t escape from the fact that over the last decade, seeing our country go in and out of a deal with Japan and in and out of a deal with France has meant that we lost a decade there. And the alternative to doing this is to have a capability gap, or probably the alternative is to be solely relying on the life of type extension of Collins, which is an answer – but, through the 2030s, will increasingly become not a great answer. In terms of operating three, that really is going to be a decision for a future government. There wouldn’t be much of an overlap, but it’s going to be a question of the precise year in which you would retire the last Collins versus the last year in which you would produce the first SSN-Aukus. They would ultimately be decisions for future governments. But we are confident that we can manage having the two submarines in the fleet and there will be a considerable degree of commonality between the Virginias and the SNN-AUKUS, which will mean that the difference is not as large as it was. V Adm Jonathan Mead says: I totally agree with what the deputy prime minister said. So we currently have, with the Collins class, a US combat system and a US torpedo. I have submariners working for me who have just been part of a Virginia-class program at sea for over 12 months. So the way that we wanted to construct the optimal pathway is retaining that top of lineage and DNA that we have with Collins, and therefore, the Virginia. And you could put Australian submariners on board a that, and everything there, our submariners would be familiar with. And once we work with the submarines coming to Western Australia and develop our own capabilities on the Virginias, then the move to SSN-Aukus, which will have incredible commonality with propulsion systems, platforms, weapons, combat systems and sensors, once again, by the time we get SSN-Aukus, our submarine force … and the scientists that have to support Virginia will be able to move … I won’t say seamlessly, because there’s no such thing as a seamless transition, but will be able to move at low risk to SSN-Aukus. Pat Conroy: Can I just add, we’ve dealt with the crossovers before. There was a crossover between the Oberon class and the Collins class and there’s more commonality between these two submarines than there was between those two. Four US submarines stationed in WA for training not a foreign base: Marles Q: You made it very clear this morning that the stationed submarines in Western Australia will not constitute a US base. However, if there are up to four submarines out there, helping to train Australian sailors, they could be called on at any time to provide support in the Pacific. In what way is that not a base? Marles: Well, it’s a forward rotation. So they’re not going to be based there. But you know, right now, we have a forward rotation of marines, US marines in Darwin. So the same point can be made in respect of that presence. And we have an ongoing use of the continent in various ways by the United States, and not just by the United States. For example, Singapore probably uses our continent more than any country in terms of its military operations. But we made clear, and I made clear in my sovereignty statement to the parliament a few weeks ago, that it has been a bipartisan position of governments in this country [and] it remains the position of the Albanese government that there won’t be foreign bases in Australia. And this will not be a foreign base. It’s a forward rotation. Marles ‘confident that this will be an enduring arrangement with the US’ Q: This timeline will span several US presidential administrations. Are you concerned that a future US president will tear it up? Marles: Well, I’m not, is the answer to your question. The US alliance has thrived under successive administrations and governments in Australia since the end … Well, since the second world war. And that includes over the last ten years. So I’m confident that this will be an enduring arrangement with the United States. I’m confident on that … based on past record. I’m also confident about it because right now, elements of this arrangement will require congressional approval. Our American counterparts are busily working with members of the Congress in the House and the Senate, and that’s across the political spectrum and across the political spectrum, there is complete support for the relationship with Australia and the AUKUS arrangements. So we enter this with a high degree of confidence. Q: Just to back up on the waste issue, you’ve been squabbling for 30 years over where to bury low-level waste and it’s still yet to be resolved. You’ve got less time than that to establish a high-level facility and reprocessing. You’ve said defence land. Would it not be easy to just [dispose of] it in Woomera? Which is defence land and has a base up there? And if I could, a second, your conversation with the French defence minister, in November last year, Emmanuel Macron at Apec in Thailand was criticising the Aukus deal saying, listen, it will risk a nuclear conflict with China and cost Australian sovereignty over a submarine fleet. Are the French no longer of that view? Marles: Let me answer the second first. I’m not about to speak for France. Q: You said you spoke to the defence minister. Marles: Again, I’m not going to speak for France and they’re very obviously capable of speaking for themselves. I was very grateful for the conversation. I would say that we feel our relationship with France is in a good place. We’ve put in an enormous amount of effort, as have they, to rebuild the relationship from where it was 18 months ago. France matters because they are effectively our closest neighbour. The closest overseas population to where we’re sitting today is in France, it’s in Noumea. And France see us as a critical partner as well. We both want the relationship to be going in the right direction and I genuinely believe it is but ultimately the French will react, as they do, to this and I’ll let them speaks for themselves. In respect of the first question, firstly, we are talking about more than 30 years from now. Q: Australia has been accused of making a time bomb. Was Beijing on the list of the phone calls you made? Marles: We’ve offered a briefing to China. Marles: Defence costing for program is neutral over forward estimates Q: Even taking difficulties of forecasting it into account, do you endorse the $268bn to $368bn as a figure? Can you clarify the cuts that we may have to have? The opposition leader is talking about cuts to the NDIS. Marles: In terms of the first part of the question, I’ll let you do the maths, but whatever maths you end up doing will have a lot of assumptions in it that are difficult to verify at this moment. 0.15% of GDP is the clear and most honest way to identify the costs through the life of the program. I’m not about to turn it this into a press conference about what the budget looks like. Obviously, the treasurer is … [working with] the [expenditure review committee] right now in full swing and there’s a lot of conversations going on in relation to that. The important point to make about the cost in respect of forward estimates is that defence is covering it. So defence is cost neutral with this over the forward estimates. The idea that anyone would have suggested that was possible when, you know, we came to government, would have been described as crazy, and yet we have got to a point where it will be defence neutral over that time. Pat Conroy: Just to supplement, that 0.15%, to be clear, includes costings that have never been provided for other defence projects in this country. It includes developing and upskilling workforce and industry, supporting the supply chain, the infrastructure in South Australia and Western Australia, the build and delivery of the program, the operations, importantly, sustainment of the platforms and weapons and contingency. Unlike the attack class which didn’t include the costs of the workforce, the facilities, contingency, weapons, sustainment, or the west coast-based infrastructure. So it’s as the DPM has said, we are being transparent with the public about the costs of this national undertaking. Marles: ‘This is as good a value-for-money spend in defence as you will get’ Q: As you said before, this program is very costly and yet there’s 0.15% increase to [defence spending] as a percentage of GDP. That seems rather modest, especially when you consider that experts like Marcus Hellyer and Dennis Richardson were predicting that defence spending would have to be at least 2.75% of GDP if not more. How do you tally the giant cost of it and it being relatively modest? Marles: Well, I mean, it’s a really good question. I think 0.15% of GDP is the best way to describe this and I think when you consider what we are doing to transform the capability and potency of the Australian Defence Force, it is modest. I think that’s right. Q: I’m not endorsing it. I’m questioning why it shouldn’t be higher? Marles: No, no. I’m endorsing the idea that it’s modest. When you think about the potency and capability that comes from this, this is as good a value-for-money spend in defence as you will get. We’ve got a long way to go in terms of how we structure the ADF, and in about a month’s time, there will be the second of the big announcements, which is when we release the public version of the defence strategic review. And there will be some very big decisions in relation to that as well. But I think it is important to understand that amid all the figures that have been thrown around in respect of this program – and it’s the point I was making earlier – you can take any ability of government and forecast it out to the middle of the 2050s and you will get a large number. And let’s be clear, there’s something of a guesstimate whenever one does that because inherent in that number is whatever the inflation rate is in 2050 and no one knows that. But when you bail it all down we’re talking about 0.15% in the context of a defence budget that is right now at 2.0% and growing to 2.2%. And for that 0.15% we transform the potency of our defence force which is why we must do this. ‘You can judge us at that point’: answers to funding questions will become apparent in budget, Marles says Richard Marles says the trio will not be able to answer all the questions today. That includes the first question. Q: Is a high-level nuclear waste dump the price that South Australia will have to pay for the jobs that go to the state? Marles: Well, as I indicated earlier there will be a process that we will determine in the next 12 months … how the site will be identified. You’ve made a leap that we won’t make for some time. It will be a while before a site is identified but we will establish a process. And the second question: Q: The $9bn the government is spending over the forwards has a neutral impact on the budget, $6bn because of what was allocated to the attack class but $3bn is coming from the integrated investment program. Can you give more detail about … where that money is coming from? And if not today, when? Marles: I won’t give you the detail today except you’re right to identify the integrated investment program and obviously the strategic review has had a good look at all of that. It will be plain in time of the budget. And the third question. Q: Why not now, though? You must have an idea where those cuts are going to be? In the interests of transparency, people want to judge what the opportunity cost of the nuclear submarines are. Unless you’re suggesting it’s cuts first and work it out later? Where are the cuts coming from? Marles: Well, no. You will get all of that information before the budget, which is measured in just a couple of months, so you can judge us at that point. Defence industry minister says skills academy to be established for training apprentices in shipbuilding Pat Conroy steps up (he is the defence industry minister): My messages to Australian industry and workers is that this work starts right now. It starts right now – $6bn will be spent in the next four years, investing in the Australian industry and work force, for example infrastructure grades, skills development, training and apprenticeships, capacity building of Australian suppliers will be lifted so they cannot just supply us, but supply our Aukus partners. The development of the submarine construction yard commences this year. We’ll be expanding the shipbuilding workforce with more apprentices, undergraduates and graduates in the next few months. We’ll establish a skills academy to deliver training and train hundreds of apprentices each year. An apprentice who starts on this project today could work their entire career building these submarines for Australia, which is a tremendous opportunity. We’ll upskill workers in adjacent industries. Furthermore, hundreds if not thousands of Australian workers will work overseas in US and UK shipyards helping them build their submarines and bringing back valuable skills and experience to help with our building build. We’ll work with Aukus partners to identify specific opportunities for Australian industry to participate in the nuclear submarine supply chain for our partners. This will help ease the supply chain constraints the United Kingdom and the United States are currently experiencing. It will leverage the considerable expertise already present in Australian industry and it will boost our capacity ahead of the commencement of the Australian build program. … These are just some of the opportunities that we’ll be exploring. We’ll be pursuing opportunities for the construction yard to manufacture components for the United States and UK production lines, helping us build our experience and certify the facilities and the workforce. And over the course of the program, it’s estimated that we will spend around $30bn just uplifting the skills and capacity of the Australian industry and the Australian workforce. ‘We’re in a good place with France’, says Marles Marles continues: One of the things I would want to make clear is Aukus is not a new alliance. Aukus is a technology-sharing arrangement between Australia, the US and the UK. In an operational sense, we are building our relationship with France, with a much greater tempo of military exercises, with greater access to our bases on the Australian continent but also French bases in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean. Ours is a relationship which is growing in strength. And I’m really pleased about my personal relationship with the French defence minister which for me typifies the warmth of the relationship we have with France. We’re in a good place with France and that matters because, really, France is effectively our closest neighbour. The deputy prime minister and defence minister finishes by thanking the public service, which he says has gone above and beyond to get the announcement ready. More than 60 diplomatic calls made to regional and world leaders in past week: Marles Richard Marles: Now, it’s been said a number of times today that this is a conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarine, so Australia has no intention of operating nuclear weapons from our soil. But we reiterate and reaffirm today that in every part of this arrangement, Australia will be meeting its obligations under the treaty of Rarotonga and that includes through the US and UK rotation at HMAS Stirling from the late 2020s. There has been a huge diplomatic effort which has underpinned the announcement today and that’s been going on for months, but it’s particularly been going on over the last week. Between myself, the minister for the Pacific in this context, the foreign minister and indeed the prime minister, we’ve made more than 60 calls to regional and world leaders within the Pacific, within Asean, within our Five Eyes partners. And I’ll let those countries speak for themselves, but I am very grateful for the response that we have received. Particularly in this context, I want to mention France, given all that occurred 18 months ago. I spoke with my French counterpart last Tuesday. I took him through this announcement in detail. So there are no surprises. Marles continues: A precondition of the whole program with Aukus is to be making sure that everything we are doing is compliant with non-proliferation treaty obligations, and we are really confident that we are setting the highest bar in relation to our NPT obligations and we’ve been working closely with the International Atomic Energy Agency in respect of this. In this respect, the sealed nuclear reactor is our friend, because by virtue of having a sealed reactor, we can provide assurance in respect of every piece of nuclear material through the life cycle of the nuclear material. We are making a commitment that we will dispose of the nuclear reactor. That is a significant commitment to make. This is going to require a facility to be built in order to do a disposal that will be remote from populations. We are announcing that will be on defence land, current or future. Now, to be clear, the first of the [nuclear material] we will dispose of will not happen until the 2050s, but within the year, we will announce a process by with this facility will be identified. We are also a proud signatory to the treaty of Rarotonga. That commits us to not operate nuclear weapons from our territory. Cost of subs ‘an investment that we cannot afford not to make’: Marles On the cost, Richard Marles says: Now, the cost is significant. But I would be quick to add that the sort of numbers that you have seen are capability of government out to the mid-2050s and you can look at a number of ability of governments beyond defence which, if you cost it out to the mid-2050s, way have similarly large numbers. But this is a significant cost. The best estimate of the cost – to be honest, the most transparent and honest estimate of this cost – is 0.15% of GDP through the life of the program. And that needs to be seen against a defence budgeting which is currently running at 2% of GDP and is expected to grow to 2.2% of GDP. So for that 0.15% w he completely transformed the capability of the Australian defence force and the potency of the Australian defence force. This is an investment in our nation’s security. It is an investment in our nation’s economy. And it is an investment that we cannot afford not to make. Richard Marles, Pat Conroy and V Adm Jonathan Mead, the chief of the nuclear powered submarine taskforce, are holding a press conference in Canberra. Marles is feeling reflective this morning: We often describe ourselves as living in the most complex strategic landscape since the end of the second world war. We say this because we watch the global rules-based order being placed under enormous pressure in eastern Europe but also in the Indo-Pacific. And we are witnessing the biggest conventional military buildup that we have seen since the end of the second world war, and that’s happening within our region, and it is not Australia which is doing that, and we need to do this. A failure to do so would see us be condemned by history. As a trading island nation, so much harm can be done to us before ever setting foot upon our shores. And so it’s fundamentally important for our nation that we have the ability to project, and to project with impact, and a long-range nuclear-powered capable submarine will be at the heart of Australia’s future projection. It will enable us to hold adversaries at risk further from our shores. But the true intent of this submarine, of this capability, is to provide for the peace and stability of our region. Because when you look at our geography, the defence of Australia is not relevant unless there is security within our region and so we want everyone to understand – the Australian people, but [also] our friends and neighbours – that at the heart of our strategic intent is to make our contribution to the collective security of our region and to the maintenance of the global rules-based order which is so fundamental to Australia’s future; and it’s for that reason that we are acquiring a nuclear-powered submarine. In making this acquisition, it will enable us to hand on to our children and our grandchildren a country which is much more self-reliant and much more able to take care of ourselves in the very difficult future ahead. Costing of Aukus plan in the short, medium and long term Let’s return to the eye-popping cost of the Aukus plan. Australia’s entire nuclear-powered submarine program – including acquisition, construction and sustainment – is forecast to cost $268bn to $368bn between now and the mid-2050s, most of it beyond the first four-year budget period. The longer term figures are inherently harder to predict, because of things like inflation/exchange rates and so on. But the plan includes $9bn over the initial four-year budget forward estimates (the part that matters to the current planning ahead of the May budget). This is believed to include $6bn domestically, and a contribution of $3bn to assist the US submarine industrial base. As it happens, when the French submarine project was axed a year and a half ago, the then government never removed the budget allocation, so there was a $6bn allocation over four years for the dumped project. That means there is a $3bn shortfall between now and 2026-27 compared with the dumped project. Defence is being asked to offset that $3bn, through changes to defence projects (likely to be announced next month in the defence strategic review). Now to the medium term (the 10 years from now to 2032-33): The whole-of-program Aukus costs are predicted to be $50bn to $58bn over the medium term, compared with $24bn allocated over the same period for the dumped French. We can start to see the costs ramping up significantly over the decade. As for the longer-term costs (2023-24 to 2054-55), the government is estimating a whole-of-program cost of about 0.15% of GDP a year on average. That is a subset of Labor’s election pledge to keep overall defence spending of at least 2% of GDP annually. Like we said – giant flags: Aukus nuclear submarine deal loophole prompts proliferation fears This from our colleague in the US Julian Borger is worth your attention: The Aukus scheme announced on Monday in San Diego represents the first time a loophole in the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has been used to transfer fissile material and nuclear technology from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. The loophole is paragraph 14, and it allows fissile material utilized for non-explosive military use, like naval propulsion, to be exempt from inspections and monitoring by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It makes arms controls experts nervous because it sets a precedent that could be used by others to hide highly enriched uranium, or plutonium, the core of a nuclear weapon, from international oversight. What is the next step for South Australia? Malinauskas: I’m very much looking forward to hopefully having significant members of the federal government here in South Australia tomorrow. We’ve been discussing a range of issues with the commonwealth around that skills workforce piece, but also the infrastructure issues that need to be addressed down at Osborne. This morning we learned the commonwealth has allocated $2bn worth of expenditure over the next four years at Osborne. That’s going to start this calendar year around gearing up the shipyards to start building the submarines towards the ends of this decade. It’s an exciting proposition. The money seems to be there, the plan is there, we need to get on with the task which we’re very committed to doing. Is the South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, confident SA can build these submarines? Well the short answer is yes, absolutely, without equivocation. We’ve seen here in South Australia that when we’re actually give a continuous pipeline of work to build capacity around, then the industry here in South Australia is more than capable of delivering it. What has been the challenge up until this point is the constant stop-start policy that we’ve seen from the federal government regarding naval shipbuilding that’s compromising the ability for the private sector to invest. Now we’ve got this long-term plan, a continuous build, a continuous pipeline, it gives the ability for governments to have the skills program that is required to develop the workforce and private industry the ability to make the capital investments to improve their complexity so they can deliver on such a significant enterprise. The best example I can give you in real terms is the air warfare destroyer project. We know the first one was very, very expensive indeed. And there were time delays associated with it. But because there was a second and third, by the end of the third air warfare destroyer, it was largely on budget and operated within an appropriate time frame. So we can do this. When there’s the ability to plan ahead and now of course we have this with this commitment to continuous nuclear submarine building right here in South Australia. The US ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy was at the Aukus announcement and was asked about concerns the agreement would inflame tensions in the region. Kennedy said: You heard the leaders talk about [how] this is intended to secure and peace and stability of the region. I think it’s got deterrent capabilities. It doesn’t have nuclear weapons. I think a lot of that is just, you know, trying to diminish the significance of this. But I think this is really going to bring peace and prosperity in the region. Richard Marles and Pat Conroy, who look after the defence portfolios, will be holding a press conference in Canberra in just under an hour to discuss today’s announcement. You can add the Greens to the list of “not fans of Aukus”. David Shoebridge said in a statement: This is a 368 billion dollar nuclear-powered raid on public education, health, housing and First Nations justice that will starve core services for decades to come. Unlike the Coalition, the Greens will not be cooperating with the government to force budget savings on critical public services to pay for these submarines. Until it is reversed, today’s announcement will force Labor to deliver austerity budgets to funnel billions of dollars offshore to fund the US and UK nuclear submarine industries. With this one decision, Labor is mortgaging our future in order to stoke regional tensions with a dangerous escalation in regional defence spending. What should send a shiver down every Australians’ spine is that the $368 billion budget is just the ADF’s starting bid, because we know major defence projects routinely blow their budgets and timelines. Jordon Steele-John said in that same statement: The Albanese Government’s announcement of the specifics of the AUKUS pact is a fundamental threat to Australian independence and our ability to collaborate in our region. It will undermine the global effort to fight the climate crisis and unleash a regional arms race that only serves to enrich global arms manufacturers. The Aukus pact will see an unprecedented nuclearisation of our oceans and open Australia up to the risk of a nuclear disaster which would have effects that last generations. Make no mistake - there is not a single modern technology that has never failed. It is especially egregious that the government would see fit to announce this deal so close to the 20th anniversary of the US leading Australia into an illegal invasion of Iraq for which they have never apologised or demonstrated that they have learned any of the lessons that come from that humanitarian disaster. This deal has been compromised from the start. It was dreamt up by a Morrison government on its way to electoral defeat and stewarded by US military advisors who got rich off telling the Australian government how they could best serve American Interests. The Australian Conservation Foundation has also responded, and it is safe to say the organisation is not a fan of the plan. The foundation’s nuclear analyst Dave Sweeney said: The arrangement announced today will undoubtedly elevate regional tensions and increase risks for Australians and our neighbours. This deal introduces new and significant safety risks that Australia has never had to deal with before. There are risks of possible future accidents in our ports and waters, especially given nuclear regulator ARPANSA’s assessment that emergency management arrangements in Australia ‘are not fit for purpose for a future with nuclear powered submarines.’ Pacific nations, Indonesia and others in our region have deep concerns about AUKUS. This arrangement further entangles Australia in the USA’s war-fighting plans. It raises serious non-proliferation concerns relating to access to highly enriched weapons-grade uranium and sets a disturbing precedent for imitation and escalation. Australia would be the only nation without nuclear weapons but with nuclear submarines. It may embolden other nations to go down this path, increasing global nuclear risks. There is no clarity about how the government intends to manage the resulting high level nuclear waste for the thousands of years it remains radioactive. As many Australians face daily cost of living pressures – and we all face the pressures of the climate crisis – this deal comes with a massive financial cost we will all bear. This whole process has lacked rigour or transparency and will cost Australians many billions of dollars that would be much better spent on social and environmental problems. The Australian Shipbuilding Federation of Unions has responded to the official Aukus announcement: The Australian Shipbuilding Federation of Unions (ASFU) cautiously acknowledges the 14 March announcement in San Diego of the parties to the Aukus trilateral security pact – the governments of Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States – to commit to a joint-build of a new class of submarine that will maximise the involvement of Australia’s shipbuilding and defence industries. Today’s announcement raises more questions than answers on how Australia will build the workforce of the future. The ASFU seeks a commitment from the government that today’s announcement is not simply a repeat of successive governments’ failures to plan for the long term. The ASFU looks forward to working with Defence Minister Richard Marles and Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy to deliver the ASFU’s key priorities for the Osborne Naval Shipyard and the AUKUS project, including several undertakings by the Government in its commitments to the ASFU, including: A joint union/industry led workforce development program in South Australia culminating in the establishment of an Engineering Centre of Excellence to train and develop the next generation of shipbuilding engineers, tradespeople and apprentices; Establishing a precinct-wide industrial agreement that will facilitate the interoperability of the Aukus project between firms located at Osborne, and within the broader defence industry, and facilitate the portability of shipbuilding workers’ employment, skills and qualifications; A building program in South Australia that will ensure a skilled workforce is developed immediately, as will be necessary for the future AUKUS submarine build given that the Life-of- Type Extension of the Collins Class submarines and worker exchanges to the UK and USA will not be sufficient to prepare Australian defence manufacturing industries for the AUKUS build; and A commitment to ASFU consultation and direct involvement in the international UK/USA workforce exchange program. The White House pool reporter (there isn’t room for the entire press pack, so one reporter is chosen and reports back to everyone about what they see, who is there etc) has sent through their report about the president’s arrival: The Beast* pulled up alongside the press hold at 1:33 pm but POTUS got out the other side – not visible to press – and went into a building. It is quite the scenic venue. Remarks are taking place outdoors on a pier with the US, British and Australian flags in the backroad. Also visible in the water off the pier, the destroyer USS Sterett with colorful flags floating in the breeze; red, white and blue bunting and sailors lined up along the decks at attention. Also visible the USS Charlotte and USS Missouri – two Virginia class submarines. *The Beast is what the US president’s car is called – it travels everywhere with the president. The announcement ends with Joe Biden awkwardly referring to the personnel on the USS Missouri, like he is showing new friends his favourite toys. Biden: With the permission of my colleagues, I don’t know if my friends can hear, the USS Missouri, can you hear us? I see them all over there. They’re standing in attention. Can you tell them at ease? I’m the commander-in-chief, right? Anyway, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. You’re the best. You’re the best. We’re going to be the best in the world, the three of us. Sunak finishes with: This is a powerful partnership. For the first time ever, it will mean three fleets of submarines working together across both the Atlantic and Pacific, keeping our oceans free, open, and prosperous for decades to come. Joe, Anthony, we represent three allies who have stood shoulder to shoulder together for more than a century. Three peoples who have shed blood together in defence of our shared values. And three democracies that are coming together again, to fulfil that higher purpose of maintaining freedom, peace, and security now and for generations to come. Sunak: Those plans could not happen without cutting-edge American technology and expertise, so I pay tribute to you, Mr President, for your leadership. And to you, Prime Minister, for your vision of what Aukus can achieve. And for our part, the UK comes to this with over 60 years experience of running our own fleet. We’ll provide the world-leading design and build the first of these new boats, creating thousands of good, well paid jobs in places like Barrow and Derby, and we’ll share our knowledge and experience with Australian engineers, so they can build their own fleet. Our partnership is significant because not just are we building these submarines together, they’ll also be truly interoperable. The Royal Navy will operate the same submarines as the Australian Navy. And we’ll both share components and parts with the US Navy. Our submarine crews will train together, patrol together, and maintain their boats together. They will communicate using the same terminology, and the same equipment. And through Aukus, we’ll raise our standards of nuclear non-proliferation. Sunak continues: Because their security is our security. And we will go further to strengthen our resilience. For the first time the United Kingdom will move away from our baseline commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence to a new ambition of 2.5%, putting beyond doubt that the United Kingdom is and will remain one of the world’s leading defence powers. But ultimately, the defence of our values depends as it always has on the quality of our relationships with others. And those alliances will be strengthened through Aukus, the most significant multilateral defence partnership in generations. Aukus matches our enduring commitment to freedom and democracy, with the most advanced military, scientific, and technological capability. Nowhere is that clearer than in the plans we’re unveiling today for the new Aukus submarine, one of the most advanced nuclear-powered subs the world has ever known. And now it is UK prime minister Rishi Sunak’s turn. Sixty years ago, here in San Diego, President Kennedy spoke of a higher purpose: the maintenance of freedom, peace, and security. Today we stand together, united by that same purpose, and recognising that to fulfil it, we must forge new kinds of relationships to meet a new kind of challenge, just as we have always done. In the last 18 months the challenge we face has only grown. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, China’s growing assertiveness, the destabilising behaviour of Iran and North Korea – all threaten to create a world defined by danger, disorder and division. Faced with this new reality, it’s more important than ever we strengthen the resilience of our own countries. That’s why the UK … [is] announcing a significant uplift in our defence budget, we’re providing an extra #5 billion over the next two years, immediately increasing our defence budget to around 2.25% of GDP. This will allow us to replenish our war stocks, and modernise our nuclear enterprise, delivering Aukus and strengthening our deterrent. And our highest priority is to continue providing military aid to Ukraine. Albanese: Mr President. Prime Minister. For more than a century, brave citizens from our three countries have been part of a shared tradition of service in the cause of peace, and sacrifice in the name of freedom. We honour their memory. We always will. While we respect and honour the past – through Aukus, we turn ourselves to face the future. Because what the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia hold in common is more fundamental, and more universal, than our shared histories. We are bound – above all – by our belief in a world where the sovereignty of every nation is respected – and the inherent dignity of every individual is upheld. Where peace, stability and security ensure greater prosperity and a greater measure of fairness for all. And where all countries are able to act in their sovereign interests, free from coercion. Our historic Aukus partnership speaks to our collective and ongoing determination to defend those values and secure that future – today, in the years ahead, and for generations to come. A journey that will strengthen the bonds between our nations – as friends, as peers, as leaders. We embark with great confidence in the capacity and creativity of our people, with optimism in the power of what our partnership can achieve, and with an unwavering conviction that whatever the challenges ahead, the cause of peace and freedom will prevail. Albanese: The scale, complexity and economic significance of this investment is akin to the creation of the Australian automotive industry in the post-World War II period. And, just as the vision of Curtin and Chifley in creating our automotive industry lifted our entire manufacturing sector, this investment will be a catalyst for innovation and research breakthroughs that will reverberate right throughout the Australian economy and across every state and territory. Not just in one design element, not just in one field, but right across our advanced manufacturing and technology sectors, creating jobs and growing businesses, right around Australia, inspiring and rewarding innovation, and educating young Australians today for the opportunities of tomorrow. Our Aukus partnership is not just about the US and UK sharing their most advanced submarine capability with Australia, although we do appreciate that, it’s also about drawing and building on the expertise within our three nations, so that we can achieve things greater than the sum of our parts. This is a genuine trilateral undertaking – all three nations stand ready to contribute and all three nations stand ready to benefit. I look out from here today and I see new frontiers in innovation to cross. New breakthroughs in technology to achieve. A new course for us to chart, together. Anthony Albanese: From early in the next decade, Australia will take delivery of three US Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines. This is the first time in 65 years – and only the second time in history – that the US has shared its nuclear propulsion technology. We are also proud to partner with the United Kingdom to construct the next generation submarine, to be called SSN-Aukus. A new, conventionally armed, nuclear-powered, submarine – based on a British design, and incorporating cutting edge Australian, UK and US technologies. This will be an Australian sovereign capability – built by Australians, commanded by the Royal Australian navy and sustained by Australians in Australian shipyards – with construction to begin within this decade. Australia’s proud record of leadership in the international nuclear non-proliferation regime will continue. We will of course continue to adhere to our obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the treaty of Rarotonga. Our agreement unlocks a set of transformative opportunities – for jobs and skills and research and innovation. In Adelaide and Barrow-in-Furness. In Western Australia and here in the United States. Opportunities that will shape, and strengthen, and grow Australia’s economy for decades and create around 20,000 direct jobs for Australians from many trades and specialisations. Engineers, scientists, technicians, submariners, administrators and trades people. Good jobs, with good wages, working to ensure the stability and prosperity of our nations, our region, and our world. Our future security will be built and maintained not just by the courage and professionalism of our defence forces, but by the hard work and knowhow of our scientists and engineers, our technicians and programmers, electricians and welders. For Australia, this whole-of-nation effort also presents a whole-of-nation opportunity. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, told the two leaders he was “honoured to stand alongside you both – here, overlooking the Pacific Ocean – as leaders of true and trusted friends of Australia”. Albanese said: Today a new chapter in the relationship between our nation, the United States and the United Kingdom begins – a friendship built on shared values, our commitment to democracy and our common vision for a peaceful and prosperous future. The Aukus agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment in Australia’s defence capability in our history – strengthening Australia’s national security and stability in our region, building a future made in Australia with record investments in skills, jobs and infrastructure, and delivering a superior defence capability into the future. My government is determined to invest in our defence capability. We are also determined to promote security by investing in our relationships across our region. (That last point is a nod to his diplomatic efforts across the region.) Biden finishes with: The unprecedented trilateral cooperation is a testament to the strength and to the shared commitment of ensuring that the Indo-Pacific remains free and open, prosperous and secure, defined by opportunity for all. A shared commitment to create a future rooted in our common values. That is the objective the United States shares not only with the United Kingdom and Australia, it’s shared by our friends in the region, our friends in Asean, the Pacific Islands Forum and the Quad and other treaty partners in the Indo-Pacific and Europe. Aukus has one overriding objective. To enhance the stability of the Indo-Pacific amid rapidly shifting global dynamics. In this first project, this first project is only beginning. More partnerships and more potential. More peace and security in the region lies ahead. Simply stated, we’re putting ourselves in the strongest possible position to navigate the challenges of today and tomorrow, together. Together. So I thank you again, Prime Minister Albanese, Prime Minister Sunak, and the United States could not ask for two better friends or partners to stand with as we work to create a safer, more peaceful future for the people everywhere. I’m proud to be your shipmates! Joe Biden again emphasises that the submarines will not have nuclear weapons, and takes the chance to crack a little joke: I want to reiterate, again, the SSN-Aukus will not have nuclear weapons. It will become a future standard for both the UK and Australian navy. It will meet the defence needs while bringing the engineers, the shipbuilders, the industrial workforce, our countries, closer together, closer than ever. Let me emphasise again – nuclear propulsion is tested and safe. The United States and the UK have used it for nearly 70 years with spotless yesterday. Combined between the US and the UK, all of our nuclear-powered ships have travelled the entire globe around the entire globe, more than 150 million miles. That’s going to the moon 350 times. We can’t figure out how to get a sub to the moon, but we’ll figure it out. Joe Biden mentioned that the USS Asheville – a Los Angeles-class submarine – was visiting Western Australia now. A reminder that the US embassy announced this nearly two weeks ago. The embassy said then that the USS Asheville arrived at the HMAS Stirling Naval Base in Western Australia “for combined training exercises with Royal Australian Navy submarine forces as part of a regularly scheduled patrol in the Indo-Pacific region”. Biden: There’s a reason why not everyone has nuclear-powered submarines. Nuclear propulsion is a highly complicated technology that requires years of training to master. So we’re starting right away. Beginning this year, Australian personnel will embed with US and UK crews on boats and at bases in our schools and shipyards. We’ll increase our port visits to Australia. In fact, as we speak, the nuclear-powered sub is making a port call in Perth. And later this year, there will be a rotational presence of nuclear-powered subs to Australia to help develop the workforce it will need to build. One of the vessels you see behind me is the Virginia-class submarine, USS Missouri. Top-of-the-line submarines are the vanguard of US naval power. And excuse me for a point of personal privilege, as they say in the United States Senate where I spend a lot of time – these submarines hold a special place for the Bidens. My wife, Jill Biden, is a sponsor of the USS Delaware, a Virginia-class submarine, and she never lets me forget it! (There is polite laughter at this) Biden: Each of us standing here today representing the United States, Australia and Great Britain, is deeply committed to strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime. We’ve undertaken this project working hand in glove with the International Atomic Energy Agency and with director general Grossi. Australia will not produce nuclear fuel needed for the submarines. We’ve set the highest standards with the IAEA for verification and transparency, and we will honour each of our country’s international obligations. Working together these past 18 months, we’ve developed a phased approach that’s going to make sure Australian sailors are fully prepared to operate the fleet to deliver the critical capacity on the fastest, fastest possible timetable. Each of our nations is making concrete commitments to one another. We’re backing it up with significant investments to strengthen the industrial bases in each of our countries in order to build and support these boats. By the way – this partnership is going to mean an awful lot for good paying jobs, for all workers in our countries, including a lot of union jobs. Biden: So today, as we stand at the inflection point in history where the hard work of announcing deterrence and enhancing stability is going to reflect peace and stability for decades to come, the United States can ask for no better partners in the Indo-Pacific where so much of our shared future will be written. Forging this new partnership, we’re showing again how democracies can deliver, how our own security and prosperity and not just for us, but for the entire world. Today, we’re announcing the steps to carry out our first project under Aukus and developing Australia’s conventionally armed nuclear armed submarine capacity. And I want to be clear. I want to be clear from the outset right off the bat so there’s no confusion or misunderstanding at this critical point – these subs are powered - not nuclear armed subs. They’re nuclear powered - not nuclear armed. Australia is a proud non-nuclear weapons state, and it’s committed to stay that way. These boats will not have any nuclear weapons of any kind on them. Joe Biden: It’s an honour, honour to be here to welcome Prime Minister Albanese and Prime Minister Sunak. And it’s my honour to welcome them both to the United States as they take the next critical step in advancing the Australia-US-UK partnership, Aukus. It’s an unusual name, Aukus, but it’s a powerful entity! You know, when our countries first announced Aukus 18 months ago, I’m not at all sure that anyone believed how much progress we’d be able to make together and how quickly we’d accomplish it. Biden continues: [It is a] testament to the strong and deep support for this partnership across the United States. Australia and the United Kingdom are two of America’s most stalwart and capable allies. Our common values, our shared vision for a more peaceful and prosperous future, unite us all across the Atlantic and the Pacific. For more than a century, we’ve stood together to defend freedom and strengthen democracy and to spur greater opportunity in all of our countries. I’ve always said, when I’m asked is the United States is a Pacific country … Around the Pacific Ocean, we are a Pacific power. The United States has [focused on] safety in the Indo-Pacific for decades to the enormous benefits of Asia, to Pacific Islanders and people in the People’s Republic of China. It has been to the benefit of the entire world. We’ve kept the sea lanes and skies open and navigable for all. We’ve upheld the rules of the road that fuelled international commerce and our partnerships have helped underwrite incredible growth and innovation. The music has started and Joe Biden, Anthony Albanese and Rishi Sunak are walking up to the lecterns – the announcement is begginning. There are trumpets. Again, pageantry. This meeting will be one of Arthur Sinodinos’s last acts as US ambassador – Kevin Rudd will be stepping into the role very soon. Just three guys, sitting around, chatting nuclear submarines. As you do. The three leaders will make their official announcement sometime around 8am AEDT. For those wondering, the giant flags on the USS Missouri, where the official announcement will be made, are in order of the nations in Aukus – so Australia, the UK and the US. There also seems to be a lot of naval officers taking what will be very bad photos, given how quickly they seem to be throwing the phone up and hitting the shutter. There hasn’t been any time for composition. One of the key points of interest was always going to be whether South Australia was unhappy with the “off-the-shelf” solution (buying three to five Virginia class submarines in the 2030s) as a stopgap to domestic production. But the Labor premier of South Australia, Peter Malinauskas, appears happy. According to the information released today, “enabling works” will start this year in Osborne, South Australia, because the shipyard will be almost three times larger than the yard forecast for the abandoned French submarine program. The Australian government argues up to 4,000 workers will be employed to design and build the infrastructure for the submarine construction yard in Osborne at the peak. In 20 to 30 years, a further 4,000 to 5,500 direct jobs are expected to be created (double the workforce for the French program). Malinauskas has put his name to a joint statement with the federal government, which says South Australian industry “will see a major capability and capacity uplift as it takes its place at the forefront of one of Australia’s greatest industrial undertakings”. The statement says there will be an estimated investment in South Australia of $2bn over first four years. Malinauskas said: The significance of this moment cannot be overstated. The Aukus submarines will be the most complex machines that have ever been built in human history. And they will be built here in South Australia. But it is not just the thousands of workers to be employed at Osborne who will benefit. This is a transformational opportunity to increase our economic complexity. That means more highly skilled, highly paid jobs across our economy that will help lift the standard of living for generations of South Australians. We now have a massive task ahead of us to prepare the highly skilled workforce to capitalise on this historic opportunity. What does Australia “strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime” mean? The White House says: Our nations have made clear commitments to meet these objectives, including that: As a non-nuclear-weapon state, Australia does not – and will not – seek to acquire nuclear weapons; Australia will not enrich uranium or reprocess spent fuel as part of this program; Australia will not produce its own nuclear fuel for its SSNs; The United Kingdom and United States intend to provide Australia with nuclear material in complete, welded power units that will not require refueling during their lifetime; The nuclear fuel that Australia receives cannot be used in nuclear weapons without further chemical processing, which would require facilities that Australia does not have and will not seek; and This initiative will occur within the framework of Australia’s Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (CSA) and Additional Protocol (AP) with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The White House has released a fact sheet on the agreement. Among the fact breakdown is how Australia will manage the nuclear waste generated through the submarine program: Responsible Stewardship of Naval Nuclear Propulsion Technology All three nations appreciate the enormity of this endeavor and are committed to the principles that have upheld the United Kingdom and United States naval nuclear propulsion programs’ unmatched safety records. For over 60 years, the United Kingdom and United States have operated more than 500 naval nuclear reactors that have collectively travelled more than 150 million miles – the equivalent of over 300 trips to the moon and back – without incident or adverse effect on human health or the quality of the environment. Australia is committed to upholding these same standards to safely steward naval nuclear propulsion technology. As part of this commitment to nuclear stewardship, Australia has committed to managing all radioactive waste generated through its nuclear-powered submarine program, including spent nuclear fuel, in Australia. The United Kingdom and the United States will assist Australia in developing this capability, leveraging Australia’s decades of safely and securely managing radioactive waste domestically. Australia will manage these materials in accordance with its nuclear non-proliferation and other international obligations and commitments. Given the UK tories adopting Australia’s “stop the boats” policy, “shared vision” here now means quite a few things. That statement continued: This plan is designed to support Australia’s development of the infrastructure, technical capabilities, industry and human capital necessary to produce, maintain, operate, and steward a sovereign fleet of conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines. Australia is fully committed to responsible stewardship of naval nuclear propulsion technology. When we announced the AUKUS partnership in September 2021, we committed to set the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard. The plan we announce today delivers on this commitment and reflects our longstanding leadership in, and respect for, the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. We continue to consult with the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop a non-proliferation approach that sets the strongest precedent for the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine capability. Our plan elevates all three nations’ industrial capacity to produce and sustain interoperable nuclear-powered submarines for decades to come, expands our individual and collective undersea presence in the Indo-Pacific, and contributes to global security and stability. In these outcomes, AUKUS reflects the principle that shared action, taken in partnership, can benefit all. Implementing AUKUS will also require robust, novel information sharing and technology cooperation. Our nations are committed to further trilateral collaboration that will strengthen our joint capabilities, enhance our information and technology sharing, and integrate our industrial bases and supply chains while strengthening the security regimes of each nation. For more than a century, our three nations have stood shoulder to shoulder, along with other allies and partners, to help sustain peace, stability, and prosperity around the world, including in the Indo-Pacific. We believe in a world that protects freedom and respects human rights, the rule of law, the independence of sovereign states, and the rules-based international order. The steps we are announcing today will help us to advance these mutually beneficial objectives in the decades to come. And now the three-way joint announcement is out – the three leaders have released a statement ahead of their appearance on the USS Missouri within the next hour. From the statement: In September 2021, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States announced AUKUS – a new security partnership that will promote a free and open Indo-Pacific that is secure and stable. The first major initiative of Aukus was our historic trilateral decision to support Australia acquiring conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines (SSNs). Today, we announce our pathway to achieve this critical capability. Together we will deliver SSN-Aukus – a trilaterally-developed submarine based on the United Kingdom’s next-generation design that incorporates technology from all three nations, including cutting edge U.S. submarine technologies. Australia and the United Kingdom will operate SSN-Aukus as their submarine of the future. Australia and the United Kingdom will begin work to build SSN-Aukus in their domestic shipyards within this decade. In order to deliver conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines to Australia at the earliest possible date, we intend to pursue the following phased approach, moving through each phase based on mutual commitments from each nation: Beginning in 2023, Australian military and civilian personnel will embed with the U.S. Navy, the Royal Navy, and in the United States and United Kingdom submarine industrial bases to accelerate the training of Australian personnel. The United States plans to increase SSN port visits to Australia beginning in 2023, with Australian sailors joining U.S. crews for training and development; the United Kingdom will increase visits to Australia beginning in 2026. As early as 2027, the United States and United Kingdom plan to begin forward rotations of SSNs to Australia to accelerate the development of the Australian naval personnel, workforce, infrastructure and regulatory system necessary to establish a sovereign SSN capability. Starting in the early 2030s, pending Congressional approval, the United States intends to sell Australia three Virginia class submarines, with the potential to sell up to two more if needed. This step will systematically grow Australia’s sovereign SSN capability and support capacity. In the late 2030s, the United Kingdom will deliver its first SSN-AUKUS to the Royal Navy. Australia will deliver the first SSN-AUKUS built in Australia to the Royal Australian Navy in the early 2040s. And the second half of that announcement: Our plan elevates Australia’s industrial capacity to produce and sustain advanced SSNs, alongside our AUKUS partners. Importantly, the SSNs will be an Australian sovereign capability, commanded by the Royal Australian Navy and sustained by Australians in Australian shipyards. Australia has a proud record of leadership in the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. Australia and our Aukus partners are committed to setting the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard for Australia’s acquisition of SSNs, in continued close cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). These enhanced defence capabilities will make Australia and our partners better able to deter conflict, and help ensure stability and strategic balance are maintained in the Indo-Pacific. Together with our Aukus partners, the Albanese Government will deliver the Optimal Pathway, providing a superior and sovereign capability, generations of jobs and a record level of investment which will keep Australians safe. The official announcement from Anthony Albanese and Richard Marles is also out: Today’s significant Aukus announcement about Australia’s acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines is the single biggest investment in our defence capability in our history and represents a transformational moment for our nation, our Defence Force and our economy. The agreement will: Strengthen Australia’s national security and contribute to regional stability in response to unprecedented strategic challenges. Build a future made in Australia, by Australians, with record investments in defence, skills, jobs and infrastructure. Deliver a superior capability after a decade of inaction and mismanagement. Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States have agreed to a phased approach that delivers on the commitments of the Albanese Government and provides significant, long-term strategic benefits for all three countries. For Australia, the three key elements are: Increased visits of US submarines commencing in 2023 and UK submarines from 2026, and, beginning in 2027, rotations of UK and US submarines to Australia – this will be key to Australian jobs, infrastructure, technology and our ability to be sovereign ready. From as early as the 2030s, delivery of three US Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia – ensuring there is no capability gap. Australia and the UK will deliver SSN-AUKUS, a new conventionally-armed nuclear-powered submarine, based on a UK design, incorporating cutting edge Australian, UK and US technologies. The UK will deliver its own first SSN-AUKUS in the late 2030s, with the first SSN-AUKUS built in Australia delivered in the early 2040s. We expect the phased approach will result in $6 billion invested in Australia’s industrial capability and workforce over the next four years, creating around 20,000 direct jobs over the next 30 years. This whole of nation effort also presents a whole of nation opportunity; for new jobs, new industries, and new expertise in science, technology, and cyber. Businesses right across the country in every state and territory will have the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from these opportunities over decades. Over the next four years, this will see $2 billion in expected investment into South Australia, and a further $1 billion in Western Australia. This commitment from the Australian Government will require funding for the phased approach to amount to around 0.15 per cent of GDP per year, averaged over the life of the program. The press releases have started rolling in. South Australia will be the home of the Australian nuclear-powered submarine construction – they will be built at Osborne. This will see an estimated investment in South Australia of $2bn over the Forward Estimates. The Submarine Construction Yard created for the build of our next-generation nuclear-powered submarines will be almost three times larger than the yard forecast for the Attack class program. The work in South Australia begins right away – we are already investing in the workforce required and putting in place the infrastructure to support the build. At its peak, up to 4,000 workers will be employed to design and build the infrastructure for the Submarine Construction Yard in Osborne, South Australia. A further 4,000 to 5,500 direct shipyard jobs are expected to be created to build nuclear-powered submarines in South Australia when the program reaches its peak – almost double the workforce forecast by the former Government for the Attack class program. This does not include the additional jobs created in the supply chain for the construction or sustainment of submarines. You can read all about what we know, here: So there you have it – Australia could spend up to $368bn between now and the mid-2050s for up to five US submarines (at least three, another two if needed) and helping to subsidise the US production (because the US can’t keep up with the demand for the Virginia class submarines). That will also cover the development of the Adelaide shipyard (at Osborne) to build the future Australian-British submarine. Still, that is an absolutely eye-watering cost. Daniel Hurst has also broken the announcement down into key points for you: Australia’s entire nuclear-powered submarine program - including acquisition, construction and sustainment - is forecast to cost $268bn to $368bn between now and the mid 2050s, most of it beyond the first four-year budget period. This includes $9bn over the initial four-year budget period. The $9bn over the forward estimates is an increase of $3bn compared with the $6bn earmarked for the abandoned French project - and Defence is being asked to offset that $3bn. Australian shipyard and design construction is expected to begin from 2023. This will include “enabling works this year” in Osborne, South Australian, because the shipyard will be almost three times larger than the yard forecast for the abandoned French submarine program. The government argues up to 4,000 workers will be employed to design and build the infrastructure for the submarine construction yard in Osborne at the peak. In 20 to 30 years, a further 4,000 to 5,500 direct jobs are expected tone created (doubled the workforce for the French program). Australia and the UK plan to start building the SSN-Aukus submarine in their domestic shipyards “beyond the end of this decade” (starting in the 2020s). But building submarines is a major endeavour, and the government believes the first Australian-built SSN-Aukus would not be finished and delivered to the Royal Australian Navy until the early 2040s. Daniel Hurst is out of the Aukus lockup – here is his first take. The main phases of the plan: 1. From this year, Australian military and civilian personnel are set to embed with the United States Navy, the United Kingdom Royal Navy “and, subject to any necessary arrangements, within the United States and United Kingdom submarine industrial bases”. This aims to boost training and development of Australian personnel. The US will also increase nuclear-powered submarine port visits to Australia from this year, with Australian sailors joining US crews for training and development, whereas the UK is set to increase visits to Australia from 2026. 2. From 2027 at the earliest, the UK and the US plan to establish a rotational presence of one UK Astute class submarine and up to four US Virginia class submarines at HMAS Stirling near Perth, Western Australia. This will be called ‘Submarine Rotational Force-West’ (SRF-West). The Australian government argues this rotational presence “will comply fully with Australia’s longstanding position of no foreign bases on its territory” because these submarines will be rotated through the location and will not be permanently based in Australia. The three countries argue the rotational presence will “put our nations shoulder to shoulder as Australia builds the necessary operational capabilities and skills to steward and operate its own fleet of nuclear-powered submarines”. 3. Beginning in the early 2030s, the US intends to sell Australia three Virginia class submarines, with the potential to sell up to two more if needed (all pending approval from the US Congress). The three governments argue this is “critical to continue growing Australia’s ability to own and operate a fleet of SSNs, and to provide Australia with a sovereign capability at the earliest possible date” while not allowing a capability gap caused by the retirement of Australia’s conventional Collins class submarines from the 2030s. 4. The final phase is the delivery of the so-called “SSN-Aukus”, a nuclear-powered attack submarine based on a UK design and featuring advanced US technology. This design will eventually be used by both the UK and Australia. The first Australian-built SSN-Aukus would be delivered to the Royal Australian Navy in the early 2040s. The USS Missouri in San Diego is the backdrop for the submarine announcement – along with three of the biggest flags I have ever seen. The US certainly knows pageantry. Once the dust has settled on this announcement, it is all going to be about how Australia pays for this. Estimates have ranged from $170bn to $200bn over the next 30 years. That figure will probably end up looking conservative though –anyone with anything to do with defence contracts knows how these things tend to blow out the budget. Peter Dutton on ABC 7.30 last night said the Coalition would be willing to provide bipartisan support to make the budget work, mentioning support for potential cuts to the national disability insurance scheme. Paul Karp reports on that here: Meanwhile, the Coalition is ready to go to war over super tax concession changes that will only impact earnings over $3m and has flat out dismissed any changes to the stage three tax cuts which are estimated to cost the budget $243bn in lost revenue over the next decade. ‘It’s been well-received’ Anthony Albanese held a bilateral meeting with Rishi Sunak in San Diego yesterday, where the submarine announcement will be made in imminently. Both were keen to emphasise “the region” in their comments. Albanese: Aukus has been a lot of hard work. But it is in the three countries’ interests. The sum of the three is more than one plus one plus one in this case. And I think that the cooperation we’ve had is really exciting. We see that this is an investment in our capability. But at the same time, of course, we’re investing in our relationships in the region as well. And I’ve been talking with other leaders in the region, as well, explaining our position. And it’s been well-received and understood why we’re doing this. It builds on our long-term relationship. Sunak: I know that we’re very excited about it. It’s about our commitment to the Pacific region, which, even though it’s geographically a long way from where we are, it’s important in a way to demonstrate our commitment to the values that we hold dear as countries. But also, it is a good year for UK-Australia more generally. We’ve got a free trade agreement, which is going to get passed through and be enforced. And also, hopefully we will get the English Lionesses to be raising the World Cup later. We’ll see how that goes. That should be exciting for us. A ‘generational challenge’ Daniel Hurst also sat down with the head of Australia’s nuclear-powered submarine taskforce, Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead, to talk about what this generational change will mean: Australia will put nuclear safety “above all else” as it begins the “generational challenge” of building and operating nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus pact, the government’s top adviser has said. Jonathan Mead has moved to allay concerns – both at home and across the region – about nuclear safety as Australia, the US and the UK prepare to announce their detailed plans within days. The head of the Australian government’s nuclear-powered submarine taskforce has also insisted that the likely presence of American and British personnel on Australian boats would not inhibit Australian command and control. ‘We have never operated a military capability at this level before’ The Aukus agreement itself, which was signed by the previous prime minister Scott Morrison, has caused some reflection from the Albanese government, given what it means for Australia’s strategic step-up, as Daniel Hurst examined a couple of days ago: There was a moment in federal parliament this week when the seriousness of the looming Aukus announcement seemed to dawn on the defence minister, Richard Marles. “It is difficult to overstate the step that, as a nation, we are about to take,” Marles, in the acting prime minister’s chair, solemnly told the chamber on Thursday. “Australia will become just the seventh country to have the ability to operate a nuclear-powered submarine. We have never operated a military capability at this level before.” The statement may not have been intended to raise doubts about whether Australia is up to the task – but it does happen to underline the extremely complex undertaking the country is about to pursue. Speculation running hot Defence watchers are keenly waiting to see how the agreement will play out for Australia: Australia is set to within a couple of weeks learn some basic details about a program that could cost more than $170bn and will run for decades. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, this week warned against opting for a new UK design. For now though, the Aukus submarine program is a “black box”, says Tom Corben, a foreign policy and defence research fellow at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre. “We’re just speculating until we get the announcement,” he says, adding that the secret has been very well kept, considering the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is set to go to the US to announce it in March. And that speculation is running almost as hot as it was in 2016, when France, Germany and Japan were competing to build a replacement for Australia’s ageing Collins class fleet. Reassurance for jittery neighbours Before we get to the announcement, it is worth looking back at how we got here. There have been some understandable jitters from our regional neighbours since the Aukus deal was announced, as Daniel Hurst has reported: The Australian government has sought to assure south-east Asian and Pacific countries that its nuclear-powered submarine plan – to be announced early next week – aims to safeguard “the peace and the stability of our region”. After a series of leaks about the potential shape of the Aukus deal, the opposition offered bipartisan support to the government’s overall decisions, while pledging to “fight to make sure the outcome is achieved as quickly as possible”. The comments follow a report by the Guardian that the long-term plan for Australian nuclear-powered submarines would likely involve a British submarine design with heavy use of American technology. We’ll get these answers very soon – but here is a list of questions ahead of the nuclear submarine announcement, including what we know so far and what we are still waiting to learn. But there is only a few minutes to go. Welcome to a special edition of our Australia news live blog as we await the details of the Australia, UK and US strategic agreement, Aukus. Australia is about to learn the fineprint of the nuclear-powered submarine plan, with the leaders of the three nations coming together in the US to make the announcement. The US president, Joe Biden, the British PM, Rishi Sunak, and the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, are in the US for the photo op of photo ops – there has been immense speculation about this agreement – so this should answer *most* questions. We will bring you everything you need to know as soon as the embargo lifts. Our defence and foreign affairs correspondent, Daniel Hurst, will bring you the Australian angles as they emerge, while our UK and US colleagues will cover the international response. Ready? Let’s get into it."

                    "bodyText": "The New South Wales government is considering banning public sector employees from using TikTok on work devices, engaging federal cybersecurity agencies for advice amid concerns over the social video app’s links to China. As the federal government considers the security of the app, the NSW electoral commission has confirmed software – including TikTok – is not permitted to be downloaded on to work mobile phones without prior approval. The state government does not yet have an overarching policy for the app’s download and use on department devices, but Guardian Australia understands that is now being reviewed. Currently NSW departments and agencies are allowed to decide their own course of action. Nearly half of all federal agencies have reportedly banned the app on government-owned devices in recent months, which has been criticised by the federal opposition for lacking a consistent and overarching response to the use of the app. The home affairs department will this month finalise a review for minister Clare O’Neil into the security risks of all social media platforms and the correct government settings. While privacy and security of data is a concern for all social media apps, the concern with TikTok and fellow China-based app WeChat has been for how data could be accessed under China’s national security law. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, this week indicated Britain could follow the US and Canada in banning the app from government devices, saying he would take “whatever steps are necessary” to protect security. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The NSW government has commenced talks with the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre about the app, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance. “The NSW Government is aware of this issue and is currently working with the ACSC,” a government spokesperson said. “The NSW government does not have an overarching policy prohibiting TikTok from government devices. Each agency has social media guidelines and procedures in place to govern how social media apps are used on work-issued devices.” The state’s own agency – Cyber Security NSW – has advised all users to take security and privacy “into consideration” when downloading any app on to a corporate device. “Cyber Security NSW continually reviews guidance and develops products for NSW government entities on workplace systems and apps,” the spokesperson said. “Cyber Security NSW will maintain a vigilant approach to cyber security.” The NSW electoral commission would not provide “detailed public commentary” on its cybersecurity plans but confirmed employees were banned from downloading the app without explicit approval. The agency is working with Cyber Security NSW, the commonwealth’s electoral integrity assurance taskforce and the ACSC. NSW Labor’s digital spokesperson, Yasmin Catley, said the Coalition had “failed” to provide an overarching policy and vowed to fix it if Labor forms government in a fortnight. “A future NSW Labor government will work with our federal government counterparts in responding to any specific concerns,” she said. Associate professor in national security at the University of Canberra, Dr Michael Jensen, believed the federal review would probably lead to a ban on government devices in commonwealth departments, with limited exceptions, and the states would probably follow. “I think that they’ll generally look to what’s happening nationally,” he said. TikTok Australia’s general manager, Lee Hunter, said TikTok was not a Chinese company, insisting it was a “global” entity that stored the data of Aussie users in Singapore and the US. “The Chinese government cannot compel another sovereign nation to provide data stored in that nation’s territory,” he said. “We have, and will continue to, proactively engage with governments at all levels in areas of shared interest, and we are always available to answer questions they may have.”"

                    "bodyText": "Good morning. On Sunday, the Observer published a report I had been working on for the past eight months about “cultural rehabilitation centres” in Somalia and Kenya, where British citizens of Somali heritage are being held against their will. It’s a complicated story of cultural identity, assimilation, and unlawful detention, but at the heart of it are the voices of those people who are left in dire situations abroad, with little to no help from the UK government. Fadumo, Bilan and Hodan (all names have been changed) trusted me with their stories – all of them begin in England and all end up in a cultural rehabilitation centre in Mogadishu, Somalia. Fadumo was just 16 when she was sent to one such centre, after being told that she was going on holiday to Dubai. Today’s newsletter explains how young British-Somalis are ending up in these harrowing situations, and the blindspots in British society that mean citizens can disappear for months or years at a time. That’s right after the headlines. Five big stories BBC | The BBC’s leadership is facing renewed pressure after the corporation U-turned to bring Gary Lineker back to Match of the Day. After a deal was reached involving a review of the BBC’s social media guidelines, opposition parties said that chairman Richard Sharp’s position was untenable because of a separate row over his role in facilitating a loan for Boris Johnson. Aukus | The UK’s nuclear-powered submarine fleet could double in size as plans were revealed for new “Aukus” vessels based on a British design. The plans were unveiled at a summit between Joe Biden, Rishi Sunak and Australian PM Anthony Albanese aimed at countering Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific. Silicon Valley Bank | Global financial markets have come under severe pressure after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, despite governments on both sides of the Atlantic taking extraordinary measures to maintain confidence in the banking system. In the UK, the government brokered a deal to sell SVB’s UK division to HSBC for £1. Policing | Suella Braverman should consider her position for putting forward “cruel and heartless” immigration policies that discriminate against war refugees of colour, a former Conservative adviser in the Home Office has said. Nimco Ali’s intervention came as Labour’s amendment to block the plans was defeated after a heated debate in the House of Commons. Culture | Dame Phyllida Barlow, described by the Guardian as “one of the art world’s most celebrated late starters”, has died aged 78. Barlow rose to international prominence as a sculptor only after retiring in 2009 after four decades teaching art. Read Adrian Searle’s tribute. In depth: ‘There wasn’t much you could do – you would even get into trouble for sleeping’ Families send wayward teenagers and young adults to “cultural rehabilitation centres” in the hope that they will straighten them out and “de-westernise” them. The truth is that the centres often operate illicitly and, as a result, the people in them are left to endure abuse, including physical beatings, shackling and solitary confinement. A lack of regulation and oversight and a preoccupation with profit has meant that the number of these centres have grown over the past decade, though there are no concrete figures to show how widespread they really are. *** What are cultural rehabilitation centres? Simply put, cultural rehabilitation centres are facilities primarily for Somalis who were born and/or raised in western countries, which claim to provide them with a strict education on their heritage and their faith. Young people are sent there by family, often parents, who feel that their child is in better hands abroad than they are in the UK. These centres have not appeared out of nowhere. The practice of dhaqan celis (which loosely translates to “return to culture”) is a well-known phenomenon within the Somali community, and used to generally refer to families who sent a child to stay with relatives in Somalia over the summer, or for a more extended visit. But in recent years it has increasingly meant that a person has been sent to a centre that offers a boarding school or boot camp type experience. One lawyer I spoke to described them as “detention centres”. Some who end up there stay for as long as a year. Parents pay hundreds of US dollars for their child to purportedly learn about their roots, their faith and the virtues of discipline. The young people I spoke to, however, said that they did not learn much, if anything at all. They spent most of their mornings reading the Qur’an, with a short break in the afternoon, and then continued reading until the evening. “You had to find ways to occupy your time, there wasn’t much you could do – you would even get into trouble for sleeping,” Fadumo told me. Anything could be viewed as an infraction: incorrectly reciting the Qur’an, sleeping in, talking in a certain tone. The punishment could be anything from a brutal beating, to being held in a dark room for days on end, to chaining a person to a wall so that they could not sleep. Residents are not allowed to leave the facilities, nor are they allowed to tell their parents what is really going on. *** Why do parents send their children away? There is no universal answer for why families feel the need to do this. Parents have been known to send their children away if they believe that they are getting involved with gangs or crime, or because they have complex mental health problems, or simply because of a more abstract fear of cultural “corruption”. Many Somalis who are living in the UK or Europe today are there because of the 1991 civil war which forced nearly 2 million people out of their country. When combined with social alienation in their new homes, the results can be troubling. *** What are the laws around this? After months of contacting embassies, government departments and legal experts, it has become clear that there is no adequate legal framework around this issue. While young people are almost always tricked into going to these centres, the cases I presented do not technically meet the legal threshold for trafficking. Kenyan and Somali authorities have raided a number of centres, but as they operate outside the purview of the law they seem to reappear frequently. So far, it seems that western governments are saying that their hands are tied: Somalia is too volatile a country, and one in which they have little presence. But questions around prevention still remain. One of the young people I spoke to was known to British social services and was enrolled in a school – how did she disappear without anyone flagging it to the relevant authorities? Given the profit incentive, there is little chance that these centres will disappear on their own. And the underlying cultural fears will take a long time to address. However, the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens – regardless of their heritage. Until adequate provisions are put in place, young people like Fadumo and the others I spoke to will continue to fall through the cracks.

                    "bodyText": "The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has hit back at China’s response to Aukus, insisting that its criticisms of the nuclear-powered submarine deal are “not grounded in fact”. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Wong also signalled that she planned to make further visits to south-east Asia and the Pacific to reassure the region that Australia does not seek to escalate military tensions. After the announcement of a multi-decade plan that could cost as much as $368bn between now and the mid-2050s, Wong said no rational observer could conclude Australia was the source of a regional arms race. She urged China to take up a US offer to agree on “guardrails” to avoid an outbreak of war, despite the concept being derided by Beijing last week. Australia has previously accused China of lacking transparency about its own rapid military buildup. “Nobody wants to see escalation. Nobody wants to see a miscalculation,” Wong said on Tuesday. “I think the region is entitled to seek that the great powers manage competition respectfully and appropriately.” Hours after the Aukus plans were announced by the US, the UK and Australia on Tuesday, China’s foreign ministry repeated its longstanding position that the deal reflected “a typical Cold War mentality” that would stimulate an arms race and “sabotage” the international nuclear non-proliferation system. China’s mission to the UN also denounced the “irony” that “two nuclear weapons states who claim to uphold the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard are transferring tons of weapons-grade enriched uranium to a non-nuclear-weapon state”. When asked about that comment, Wong said: “That response is not grounded in fact.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Wong said Australia had been “very clear” that it would not acquire nuclear weapons. She also said “a number of other countries have” nuclear-powered submarines – and they were allowed under the NPT. “Australia’s motivation is peace,” she said. Observers say the Aukus arrangement is novel, because it would be the first time that fissile material and nuclear technology had been transferred from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. But the Australian government is believed to disagree with this being characterised as a “loophole”, and it has promised not to enrich uranium or reprocess spent fuel as part of the program. Wong vowed to continue talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency to put in place “the highest quality arrangement … to ensure this material is managed in a way that is consistent with the NPT”. The UK and the US say they will provide Australia with nuclear material in “complete, welded nuclear power units that will not require refuelling” during the more than 30-year lifetime of the submarines. In a fact sheet issued on Tuesday, the Australian government added: “The nuclear fuel Australia receives cannot be used in nuclear weapons without further chemical processing, requiring facilities that Australia does not have and will not seek.” The government has, however, promised to store the nuclear waste in Australia in a location yet to be decided. In recent weeks, Australian ministers and officials have paved the way for the Aukus announcement in a series of calls and meetings with counterparts across the Indo-Pacific. But ambassadors in Canberra are expected to be briefed in detail over the coming days. Australian officials contacted their counterparts in Beijing on Monday to offer a briefing. Wong said the government had put in place “a comprehensive strategy” leading up to the announcement and made it a priority to re-engage with the Pacific and south-east Asia “in a very focused way”. The Aukus plan would give Australia “a greater capability of contributing to that strategic equilibrium which is necessary for the sort of region we all want to live in”. “Certainly it gives Australia a capability that very few countries have and that comes with responsibilities, which we are very aware of,” Wong said, adding that the plans would not undercut diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions. “Our focus and our attention should be on averting conflict, on keeping the region stable, peaceful and prosperous, and ensuring that sovereignty can be protected.” The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said the best way to reassure the region would be for Australia to sign and ratify the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Indonesia – which joined with Malaysia to raise strong concerns about Aukus after it was first announced in 2021 – responded more cautiously on Tuesday. The Indonesian foreign ministry said it was the responsibility of all countries to maintain peace and stability in the region, and it expected Australia to develop “a verification mechanism that is effective, transparent and non-discriminatory”. On the eve of the announcement, China’s nationalistic Global Times newspaper quoted Chinese analysts as claiming Australia was “planting a time bomb” and would bear the cost of its “expensive mistake”. But the incoming Australian ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, said last week Aukus should be seen in the context of China’s own push to build the world’s largest navy. China currently operates 56 submarines, of which 12 are nuclear-powered, according to the latest Pentagon assessment. Australia plans to buy at least three and as many as five Virginia-class submarines from the US in 2030s. The first Australian-built submarines, based on a yet-to-be-completed British design, should enter into service in the 2040s."

                    "bodyText": "Good afternoon. Earlier today, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced “the biggest single investment in Australia’s defence capability in our history”. Here are the main points of the Aukus submarine deal: Australia will become only the seventh nation in the world to possess nuclear-powered submarines, with the first Australian-built, British-designed asset to enter service in the 2040s. The submarines will be built in Osborne, South Australia, potentially adding up to 9,500 jobs at the peak of construction. As stopgap measures, Australia will buy at least three Virginia class submarines from the US in the 2030s, and the US and UK will establish a rotational presence of their nuclear submarines in Australia as early as 2027. The entire investment will cost taxpayers up to $368bn over the next four decades or 0.15% of GDP. China has reiterated its opposition to the deal, saying it “clearly violat[es] the object and purpose of the NPT (non-proliferation treaty).” The White House insists Australia will not enrich uranium or produce its own nuclear fuel for the submarines. But arms control experts have expressed concern about the precedent set of Australia being the first non-nuclear nation to “remove nuclear fuel from safeguards for use in naval reactors”. Australia has made more than 60 diplomatic calls to regional and world leaders to allay potential concerns. The Coalition has welcomed the deal, while the Greens have criticised it, saying the $368bn bill will come at the expense of “public education, health, housing and First Nations justice”.

The government services and NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, made the comments in a statement to Guardian Australia after the opposition leader doubled down on his offer of Coalition support if Labor wanted to make cuts to the program. On Monday, Dutton was asked if bipartisan support for Aukus would extend to giving the government leeway to make budget savings to pay for it. He replied to ABC’s 7.30: “The short answer is yes.” “In my budget in reply speech last October I said that we would work with the government if they had tough decisions to take, for example, keeping the NDIS sustainable,” he said. Dutton defended the remarks on Tuesday, telling reporters in Canberra that the program is “crucial to provide dignity and support to people with disabilities” but may become “financially unviable” without changes. “If they [the government] need to pass legislation – I’ve said nothing different to what I said in October last year … we’re willing to support that through the Senate.” Shorten responded that “defence spending comes out of the defence budget”. “It’s disappointing the Liberals are backflipping on their bipartisan support for the NDIS that the opposition leader committed to in October,” he said. “What Mr Dutton is making clear to the 575,000 NDIS participants is that the Liberals will always be looking for an excuse to slash their supports.” “We are committed to reforming the NDIS and making sure every dollar gets to the people who need it most.” Shorten said the government would need to “get on top of things like provider fraud and waste” to make the NDIS sustainable, matters to be dealt with by the independent review “which includes an examination of sustainability and costs and will be reporting back by the end of the year”. The Greens disability rights and peace spokesperson, Senator Jordon Steele-John, also defended the scheme, saying the “NDIS is an essential service for all Australians to live a happy and healthy life, yet the Coalition has been targeting the disabled community for years to try and dismantle it”. Earlier, Dutton said that Labor’s claim that the Aukus nuclear submarine plan is cost-neutral over four years is “not credible”, and that $3bn of defence cuts to fund the plan means the Albanese government is preparing to “cannibalise” other projects. Dutton otherwise offered bipartisan support for the plan to spend up to $368bn by the mid-2050s to buy up to five Virginia class submarines and build a next-generation UK-designed nuclear submarine in Australia. Dutton also offered the Coalition’s support for a plan to select a defence site for nuclear waste, promising “no politics” on that point and urging critics to “grow up”. The Australian government will spend $9bn over four years on the Aukus submarine program, including $6bn in Australia and $3bn in the UK and US, mostly the latter, to increase industrial capacity to build the Virginia class submarines. The plan is budget-neutral because the government has booked $6bn of savings from scrapping the French Attack class submarines and $3bn in unidentified other cuts to defence projects. On Tuesday the deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, said the defence strategic review had a “good look” at spending and that information about cuts will be released before the budget in two months. Marles said the defence budget will continue to grow, from 2% to 2.2% of GDP. The Aukus submarine plan will cost 0.15% of GDP on average a year in the long term to 2054-55, which Marles labelled “modest” given the “transformation in the capability and potency of the defence force”. Marles defended the $3bn cut, arguing that defence must be exposed to “budgetary discipline” and that keeping the Aukus program cost-neutral over four years is an “important down-payment on the part of defence”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “There is no ring-fencing of defence, [it] needs to justify its expenditure and value for money just as any other part of government must do,” he said. In January, after receiving the defence strategic review, Marles signalled that the government would scale back some defence projects to fund others, telling Guardian Australia “we don’t have limitless resources”. On Tuesday Dutton told reporters in Canberra “it’s not credible for the government to say that there’s no net impact even over the forward estimates”. “We can’t allow Labor to cannibalise the defence force to pay for Aukus – it’s not an either or option,” he said. Dutton conceded there might be “some savings” to be found in the defence portfolio, but called on the government to detail proposed cuts."

                    "bodyText": "In a tripartite deal with the US and the UK, Australia has unveiled a plan to acquire a fleet of up to eight nuclear-powered submarines, forecast to cost up to $368bn between now and the mid-2050s. Australia will spend $9bn over the next four years. From this year Australian military and civilian personnel will embed with US and UK navies, including within both countries’ submarine industrial bases. From 2027 the UK and the US plan to rotate their nuclear-powered submarines through HMAS Stirling near Perth as part of a push to step up training of Australians. The imperative Increased Chinese naval power and assertiveness – particularly in the South China Sea – has convinced the Australian government that it requires submarines capable of operating far from home bases, both as a deterrent and for attack capability in the event of a crisis. The current fleet of Collins class conventional submarines are expected to lose their edge from the 2030s. Nuclear-powered submarines have a distinct advantage over the diesel-electric boats of Australia’s fleet because they don’t need to surface to “snort” to recharge their batteries. Nuclear subs can leave port and stay underwater for weeks, avoiding detection. Four phases 1. Embedded personnel and port visits: Australian military and civilian personnel will embed with the the allies’ navies. US nuclear-powered submarines will increase their visits to Australian ports, with Australian sailors joining US crews for training. 2. Submarine rotations: From 2027 the UK and the US plan to rotate one UK Astute class submarine and up to four US Virginia class submarines through HMAS Stirling. 3. Sale of US Virginia-class submarines: From the early 2030s – pending approval by Congress – the US intends to sell Australia three Virginia-class submarines, with a potential option for two more if required. 4. SSN-Aukus: A combination of UK submarine design and US defence technology will contribute to the development of the new SSN-Aukus submarine – intended as the future attack submarine for both the UK and Australia. Both Australia and the UK intend to start building SSN-Aukus submarines in their domestic shipyards before the end of this decade. The first such boat may enter into UK service in the late 2030s, but the Australian navy will receive its first Australian-built SSN-Aukus submarine in the early 2040s. Australia will begin construction works on the shipyard required to build nuclear-powered submarines in Osborne, South Australia, this year. The US Joe Biden said the three nations stood at an “inflection point in history” argued that in “forging this new partnership, we’re showing again how democracies can deliver, how our own security and prosperity and not just for us, but for the entire world”. The US president stressed – repeatedly – that the submarines that will be part of the Aukus deal will be “nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed”. “Australia is a proud non-nuclear weapons state and it’s committed to stay that way. These boats will not have any nuclear weapons of any kind on them.” Australia Australia’s prime minister said the Aukus plan marked “a new chapter” in the relationship between Australia, the US and the UK. “The Aukus agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment in Australia’s defence capability in our history,” Anthony Albanese said. Without directly naming China as a source of concern, Albanese said the plan reflected a shared determination to ensure all countries could “act in their sovereign interests free from coercion”. China China responded to the announcement by saying the nuclear submarine cooperation plan was “a blatant act that constitutes serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines international non-proliferation system, fuels arms races, and hurts peace and stability in the region”. “The irony of Aukus is that two nuclear weapons states who claim to uphold the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard are transferring tons of weapons-grade enriched uranium to a non-nuclear-weapon state, clearly violating the object and purpose of the NPT [non-proliferation treaty],” China’s mission to the UN tweeted. Nuclear waste The nuclear reactors that will power the SSN-Aukus submarines will not be built in Australia. They will arrive from either the UK or US in a welded power unit and will not require refuelling during their expected lifetime. Australia has said it will not enrich uranium or reprocess any spent fuel from the submarines. But it has committed to managing all of the radioactive waste generated by the submarines within Australia. “This includes radioactive waste with lower levels of radioactivity generated by day-to-day submarine operations and maintenance,” a government fact sheet says. “And radioactive waste with higher levels of radioactivity, including spent fuel, which is produced when submarines are decommissioned at the end of their service life.” No decision has been made on the location yet. Nuclear non-proliferation concerns The Aukus scheme is the first time a provision in the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty has been used to transfer fissile material and nuclear technology from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. Paragraph 14 allows fissile material utilised for non-explosive military use, like naval propulsion, to be exempt from inspections and monitoring by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. It makes arms controls experts nervous because it sets a precedent that could be used by others to hide highly enriched uranium, or plutonium – the core of a nuclear weapon – from international oversight. James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said there was “real and concrete harm done” to the non-proliferation regime. “My fear was never that Australia would misuse that fuel, but that other countries would invoke Aukus as a precedent for removing nuclear fuel from safeguards.” The Winner of the 2017 Nobel peace prize, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said Australia’s decision to buy and build nuclear-powered submarines was both a major proliferation risk and could be seen internationally as a precursor to Australia acquiring nuclear weapons. Ican urged Australia to sign the UN treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons: the ban Ican has championed and to which 68 states around the world are now a party. The Australian government counters that it has no intention of seeking nuclear weapons, and adds: “The nuclear fuel Australia receives cannot be used in nuclear weapons without further chemical processing, requiring facilities that Australia does not have and will not seek.” Jobs The Australian government estimates the nuclear submarine program will need 20,000 jobs over the next 30 years, within the ADF, the domestic ship-building industry and the public service. The government forecasts 8,500 will be directly employed in Australia’s building and servicing of the submarines, including scientists, engineers, project managers, construction workers, electricians, fitters and builders."

                    "bodyText": "Chris Hipkins loves to cycle. New Zealand’s newish prime minister, who stepped into the job after Jacinda Ardern’s shock resignation earlier this year, has been pedalling the 30km from his home in Upper Hutt to parliament for years. It’s not a particularly safe route, with many sections where Hipkins would be riding right alongside 100kmh traffic. It’s this kind of danger that stops cycle commuting from being particularly mainstream – just 2% commuted by bike at the last census – but this is far from a political priority for Hipkins. He loves to cycle, but the main thing he wants to do is win. This intense drive towards victory is crucial to understanding why Hipkins has spent the last month ditching many sections of his government’s climate change policy, all in the aftermath of two major storms which were likely worse because of climate change. It explains why a government that happily tells other nations to stop subsidising fossil fuels is once again extending a tax cut on petrol and diesel. It’s why Hipkins on Monday ditched not just expensive climate policies like the “cash for clunkers” scrappage scheme, but also the drive to lower speed limits in many parts of the country to increase road safety. It’s not that the government couldn’t lower speeds and fix storm-damaged roads at the same time – our transport agency has around 2,400 staff – it’s that Hipkins doesn’t want to talk about lowering the speed limit. He doesn’t want to talk about spending a small amount of money on bike lanes or a media merger or votes for 16-year-olds, and he doesn’t want the media talking about it either. The money is immaterial; the conversation is not. This message discipline is ruthless enough that Hipkins is willing to ditch policies his colleagues have spent months or years on, all for emptier column inches. He’s betting that the flurry of headlines about the government getting rid of any policies that don’t have to do with what he calls “bread and butter issues” will win him votes. And it seems to be working. Hipkins has climbed in the preferred prime ministerial stakes in recent polls, and Labour is now solidly back in contention for this year’s election. Hipkins would argue that the climate is far better served by Labour winning the election than a National-Act coalition. After all, the Act party has flirted with outright denialism within living memory, while National gutted the Emissions Trading Scheme while last in government, and remains committed to reopening offshore drilling for oil and gas. But Labour cannot simply delete policies until it is in government for ever. Presumably at the election this year it will have to have some actual policies to address the fact that New Zealand’s reliance on cars and cows mean we have quite high per-capita emissions and no easy path to bringing those down, given the easier job of decarbonising our electricity generation is largely already finished. If Labour doesn’t have those policies to talk about then the Green party, which it will need to form a government, will happily fill the void. Green party co-leader James Shaw, who is also the climate change minister, told this columnist Hipkins’ repeated backdowns on climate policy were “disappointing and making things harder”. “Individually none of these policies actually add up to much – but the cumulative effect is starting to add up. We’re running out of easy options. It’s getting very difficult to find options that we haven’t already exhausted,” Shaw said. Shaw rebuffs those who want the government to simply ditch various climate policies and focus exclusively on pricing carbon through the Emissions Trading Scheme, saying the necessary price would be politically impossible. He notes that the recent surge in electric vehicle sales brought on by the government’s feebate scheme would have required an emissions price of about $500 a tonne – a price that “would result in the closure of all our heavy industry and eye-watering fuel prices for those who aren’t able to get an electric car.” Hipkins’ desertion of the field will probably benefit Shaw in the short term. The Greens can soak up climate conscious votes while Hipkins takes more of the centre-ground. But really big bold policy changes in New Zealand generally require one of the main two parties. That’s why Ardern’s “nuclear-free” line had such staying power – because it recalled a time when Labour was willing to take a big bold stance and fight with the rest of the world over it. Now the party just wants to backpedal. Henry Cooke is a freelance journalist covering New Zealand politics"

                    "bodyText": "Sydneysiders have been hit with fresh train delays, and repeated outages due to outdated communications technology and poor backup system planning are likely to continue, a transport expert has warned, as the Perrottet government is accused of neglecting upgrades. The warning came on Tuesday morning as commuters were told to “allow plenty of extra travel time” due to urgent signalling work at Broadmeadow and train repairs on the north shore line at Waitara that caused delays across the network. Tuesdays’ disruptions follow the failure of the Sydney rail network’s digital radio system last Wednesday, which resulted in a network-wide shutdown that left every train parked for 90 minutes. The breakdown occurred during the afternoon peak, stranding 250,000 commuters. There were further issues, including downed wires and isolated outages, across the train network on Friday and Saturday. Prof David Levinson, a transport planning expert at the University of Sydney’s school of engineering, said the communications network used by Sydney’s train network “is far from cutting edge”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But Levinson said “more importantly, the communications system should not have been designed with a single centralised point of failure”. “For any major infrastructure, redundancy is required for safety and to keep the system operational,” he said, adding this “is critical for a place like Sydney CBD which depends on rail for the mass movement of people”. Decentralised systems like the internet or the street network are more robust to widespread failures. Levinson was scathing of how little information had been explained to the public about the outages, including follow-up issues seen over the weekend. “From the perspective of customers, the reason why the system failed is less important than accurate information in advance about system closures, their durations, and alternatives, which were not provided.” Levinson warned repeated outages and slowdowns could occur given the state of the train network. “These systems take a long time to install, and failures often have multiple causes,” he said, noting that “many systems do have some redundancy, so it sometimes takes two or three things to go wrong for a failure to occur, not just one”. Meanwhile, Labor’s transport spokesperson, Jo Haylen, was scathing over reports that an internal Transport for New South Wales document from more than a year ago warned that Sydney trains’ digital radio system components were “obsolete” and fixing the problem was a priority. Haylen said the most recent maintenance backlog for 2021-22 was $670m, up from $440m in 2019-20. “The Liberal government was warned a year ago that components in the digital train radio system were already obsolete,” she said. “They knew that this could put the whole train network at risk but not enough has been done because there is no accountability. “Passengers are yet again paying the price because no one knows who is in charge,” Haylen said. Train drivers are reportedly going to receive handheld radios as a backup in case the technology fails again, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Levinson said this “seems a minimal threshold for redundancy”, but added “it is somewhat concerning not all of this … was thought through, or if thought through, that the solution was not implemented before”."

                    "bodyText": "It is always disappointing when an important, and potentially transformational, policy idea is introduced in a form that almost certainly guarantees its rejection. That’s even more true in the context of an election campaign, where reasoned analysis of policy invariably takes a back seat to partisan polemics. Dominic Perrottet’s announcement of a “future fund” in News South Wales to help young people finance education or the purchase of a home falls into this category. In the most attractive presentation, young people could start adult life with a fund of $50,000, enough to pay for a university degree, franchise a small business or, even, with other government assistance, pay the deposit on a modest apartment. Unfortunately, as we will see, the reality is rather different. Perrottet’s proposal is a drastically cut-down version of an idea put forward in the US by Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott in the 1990s under the name “The Stakeholder Society”. Ackerman and Alstott proposed a grant of $US80,000 to all young adults. Allowing for inflation and currency conversion, this would be something like $A250,000 today. The proposal would be financed by taxes on wealth, and by treating inheritances and gifts from close family members as taxable income. Such a proposal would convert the rhetoric of equal opportunity into something like reality. As always, the children of wealthy and well-educated parents would have a headstart, including better opportunities for school education and access to financial support. But gift taxes would reduce the capacity of the bank of Mum and Dad to transmit inequality from one generation to the next. Part of any intergenerational transfer would be taxed to provide a start for those young people not blessed with wealthy and generous parents. Although it would be a once-in-a-lifetime transfer, a stakeholder grant would share many of the features of a universal basic income. There would be no means test, and no adverse incentive effects. The funds could be used for a range of reasonable purposes, or paid out as a cash grant if not used by, say, age 30. Given that about 300,000 Australians turn 18 each year, a scheme with a grant of $100,000 would cost around $30bn a year, comparable to the revenue foregone with the stage 3 tax cuts. A grant on the scale proposed by Ackerman and Alstott would cost around $75bn, implying the need to raise lots of money through wealth and inheritance taxes. Clearly, only the commonwealth government could raise the necessary revenue. How does Perrottet’s proposal compare to a real stakeholder grant? $50,000 sounds good, but the vast bulk would come from parental contributions. The government’s contribution of $400 a year would amount to a maximum of $7,200 (plus interest earnings) which would not be reached until today’s babies turn 18 in 2041. Even so, the proposal might be worthwhile if the government contribution was the same for everyone. But under Perrottet’s plan, governments would match parental contributions. So, if parents can’t afford to contribute, their children get nothing. Perrottet softens the edge of this by saying that children whose parents receive family tax benefit will get a government contribution of $200, half the amount for well-off families who can afford the full contribution. That ratio is a pretty clear indication of Perrottet’s relative concern for low-income and high-income families. How many people would get the full grant? At first sight, $400 a year might not sound like too much for the average family. But remember that this is $400 a year for every child in the family. Not many families are as large Perrottet’s own (he is one of 12 children and has seven of his own). Equally, however, very few large families have the resources available to the Perrottets. For a family with four children, even on a decent income, finding the resources to lock away $1,600 a year could prove very challenging. Perrottet’s proposal is an inequitable mess, unlikely ever to be implemented. But that should not be the end of the story. Inequality is growing and it is increasingly being locked in over generations. A substantial stakeholder grant to young people could change it."

He was told by Rishi Sunak “we’d love to have you” when the pair held a face-to-face bilateral meeting on the fringes of the Aukus summit. “It’s my intention to go to Northern Ireland and the Republic,” Biden said, after sharing the stage with Sunak and the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to champion the three countries’ defence pact. The UK prime minister also said he had accepted an invitation from Biden to visit him in Washington DC in June. Sunak said: “It’s great that we’re going to see each other a lot over the next few months.” On the invitation on the anniversary of the Good Friday agreement peace deal, Sunak told Biden, who has Irish heritage: “I know it’s something very special and personal to you.” He voiced hopes he could make it to mark an important event. “Twenty-five years, it seems like yesterday,” said the US president. He also sought to show off his rapport with Sunak – joking that the former green card holder was “a Stanford man and still has a home here in California”. After his appearance with Sunak and Albanese, Biden said “no” when asked if he was worried China would see the move to supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines as aggression. When pushed on whether he would talk to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, soon, he said “yes”. A trip to Belfast by Biden was viewed as a high prize by the UK government for the breakthrough over the Northern Ireland protocol, which prompted the Democratic Unionist party to pull out of power-sharing last year. However, no executive has been formed since the deal clinched with the EU by Sunak in his Windsor framework, meaning questions remained about whether Biden would actually come. In recent days, the prospect looked more likely – with the White House said to have dispatched teams to carry out assessments ahead of a potential visit. Sunak also boosted hopes by declaring he was planning to formally invite Biden while on the plane travelling to meet him in San Diego, California. A host of other politicians – including Bill and Hillary Clinton – are expected in Belfast for a large event on 17-19 April organised by Queen’s University. The anniversary falls on 10 April, and marks 25 years since the day an agreement was reached by the former British and Irish prime ministers, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, as well as the former US senator George Mitchell. Some world leaders will congregate in London the following month to mark the coronation of King Charles. Sunak refused to be drawn on whether Biden would be on the invitation list, simply saying: “There’s lots of great things to celebrate.”"

                    "bodyText": "The time in Westminster is 10.35pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s news: Labour’s amendment seeking to block the Illegal Migration Bill was defeated by 249 votes to 312, a majority of 63. It will now pass to its second reading. The vote followed a debate in the House of Commons which lasted just over four hours. Earlier in the debate, home secretary Suella Braverman said: “Despite our reasonable concerns that we have raised on several occasions, like [Tory former home secretary Priti Patel] before me, I am subject to the most grotesque slurs for saying such simple truths about the impact of unlimited and illegal migration.” The home secretary also said the duty to remove “will not be applied to detain and remove unaccompanied asylum-seeking children”. She told MPs: “Given the mischaracterisation of the bill from members opposite, I would like to make a few things clear. The home secretary’s duty to remove will not be applied to detain and remove unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.” Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told the Commons there needs to be urgent action to “stop the dangerous boat crossings that are putting lives at risk” and undermining border security. But she said: “This bill is a con that makes the chaos worse. It won’t do the things the prime minister and the home secretary have promised, it won’t stop the criminal gangs or dangerous crossings and, in fact, it makes it easier for those gangs as well.” Suella Braverman should consider her position for putting forward “cruel and heartless” immigration policies that discriminate against war refugees of colour, a former Home Office adviser has said. Nimco Ali, a one-time Conservative campaigner who in December left her job as an adviser on violence against women, said the home secretary was “the wrong person not just for the Conservative party but for the country”. A child refugee from Somaliland, Ali said the government’s failure to widen routes open to Ukrainians to other refugees appeared to be “racist” and “painful”. Hundreds of people have gathered in Parliament Square to protest against the government’s controversial new asylum and migration law as MPs debated the measures in the Commons. The crowd, which first congregated around the Winston Churchill statue, chanted “What do we want? Safe passage. When do we want it? Now”, and “Who built the NHS? Migrants built the NHS.” Many held placards, which read “migrants and refugees welcome here: blame austerity, not migrants”. US president Joe Biden said it’s “my intention to go to Northern Ireland and the Republic”, after an invitation from Rishi Sunak to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement next month. The move was widely expected following the deal with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol. The issue had been seen as a stumbling block to the president’s visit as the White House urged the row to be settled. The UK’s nuclear-powered submarine fleet could double in size as plans were revealed for the new “Aukus” vessels to be based on a British design. In a bid to counter the growing threat from China, the UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, vowed alongside his US and Australian counterparts to stand “shoulder to shoulder” to protect peace in the Indo-Pacific given its implications for security across the world. Sunak quoted former US president John F Kennedy, saying the leaders gathered in San Diego were “United by that same purpose” of freedom, peace and security. He warned China, Russia, Iran and North Korea threatened to create “a world defined by danger, disorder, and division”. Praising Biden’s leadership and Albanese’s vision, Sunak said the UK would offer “over sixty years’ experience of running our own fleet” and the “world-leading design” for the Aukus class of submarines. Sunak also said the government will not try to influence the outcome of the privileges committee inquiry into claims Boris Johnson misled MPs about Partygate. Asked if he would try to persuade Tory members of the committee not to impose too tough a punishment on Johnson if they found him in the wrong, Sunak replied: “That wouldn’t be right. This is a matter for parliament and the house. It’s not a matter for the government.” Sunak rejected suggestions he is detached from the everyday concerns of the public after it emerged his new heated swimming pool uses so much energy that the local electricity network had to be upgraded to meet its power demands. The Guardian revealed that, while many Britons are trying to limit their energy use in the face of increased electricity bills, extra equipment had been installed in North Yorkshire to provide more capacity from the National Grid to Sunak’s constituency home. The BBC’s leadership was facing renewed pressure on Monday after the corporation U-turned to bring Gary Lineker back to Match of the Day, cancelling the presenter’s suspension without requiring him to make any significant concessions. Three days after Lineker was taken off air for criticising the language used by ministers when discussing the government’s asylum policy, Tim Davie, the director general of the BBC, announced an independent review of the corporation’s social media guidelines. Humza Yousaf said he would shift the campaign for independence into “fifth gear” if he wins the SNP leadership, following a suggestion from a colleague that it should “go down a gear”, PA Media reports. Ben Macpherson, the minister for social security in the Scottish government, said it would take longer than the short or medium term for Scotland to become a successful independent country. Hospitals have cancelled tens of thousands of outpatient appointments and operations this week as they prepare for a junior doctors’ strike that will severely disrupt NHS care. NHS trusts in England have postponed many more procedures than for any of the recent walkouts by nurses and ambulance staff. Theresa May is to release a book about a series of political scandals, titled The Abuse of Power, which promises to reveal the way institutions close ranks in order to avoid dishonour. The former prime minister has never released a memoir but the book – due to be published in autumn 2023 – promises to reveal the story behind famous scandals including the Hillsborough and Grenfell tragedies, the Daniel Morgan police corruption case and parliamentary dramas. That’s all from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the UK politics live blog this evening. Thanks for following along. Goodbye for now. Labour’s amendment seeking to block the Illegal Migration Bill was defeated by 249 votes to 312, a majority of 63. The vote followed a debate in the House of Commons which lasted just over four hours. Earlier in the debate, home secretary Suella Braverman said: Despite our reasonable concerns that we have raised on several occasions, like [Tory former home secretary Priti Patel] before me, I am subject to the most grotesque slurs for saying such simple truths about the impact of unlimited and illegal migration. The worst among them, poisoned by the extreme ideology of identity politics, suggest that a person’s skin colour should dictate their political views. I will not be hectored by out-of-touch lefties, or anyone for that matter. I won’t be patronised on what appropriate views for someone of my background can hold. I will not back down when faced with spurious accusations of bigotry. In contrast, Labour said the Illegal Migration Bill is a “con that makes the chaos worse” and “will lock up children”. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told the Commons: We need urgent action to stop the dangerous boat crossings that are putting lives at risk and undermining our border security. But this Bill is a con that makes the chaos worse. It won’t do the things the prime minister and the home secretary have promised, it won’t stop the criminal gangs or dangerous crossings and, in fact, it makes it easier for those gangs as well. It won’t return everyone, in fact it makes it harder to get return agreements. It won’t clear the asylum backlog, in fact it will mean tens of 1000s more people in asylum accommodation and hotels. MPs have divided to vote on the Labour amendment to the second reading of the government’s illegal migration bill. It seeks to decline to approve the bill at its second reading. The result is due at 10.15pm. US president Joe Biden said it’s “my intention to go to Northern Ireland and the Republic”, following an invitation from Rishi Sunak to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement next month. The move was widely expected following the deal with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol. The issue had been seen as a stumbling block to the president’s visit as the White House urged the row to be settled. Suella Braverman should step down for putting forward “cruel and heartless” immigration policies that discriminate against war refugees of colour, a former Home Office adviser has said. Nimco Ali, a one-time Conservative campaigner who in December left her job as an adviser on violence against women, said the home secretary was “the wrong person not just for the Conservative party but for the country”. A child refugee from Somaliland, Ali said the government’s failure to widen routes open to Ukrainians to other refugees appeared to be “racist” and “painful”. Her words came as the government faced opposition from MPs across the House of Commons as it attempted to push the illegal migration bill through parliament on Monday. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas criticised the “immoral, deeply cruel and divisive” proposed law, and ripped up a copy of the bill at the end of her speech. The MP for Brighton Pavilion said: “The home secretary on the face of this bill invites Parliament to rip up international law. The only act of a Parliament that has some kind of moral integrity is to rip up her illegal and immoral bill, which has no place on our statute book.” Independent MP Claudia Webbe (Leicester East) said “many would argue that this is racist legislation” and criticised the powers to detain people for 28 days, claiming: “This is state-sanctioned fascism.” Meanwhile back in London the debate over the illegal migration bill goes on, with a Tory MP warning that “hundreds of millions” of people want to come to the UK. Scott Benton, MP for Blackpool South, told the Commons: “Our public services are already creaking under enormous pressure and we simply can’t accept hundreds of millions of people who would no doubt look to come here for a better life. I’m afraid this country is nearly full.” He said the Aukus vessel would be “one of the most advanced nuclear-powered subs the world has ever known”. He said the plans could “not happen without cutting-edge American technology and expertise” while also heralding the “world-leading” British design. Sunak said the deal would “create thousands of good, well-paid jobs in places like Barrow and Derby”. Sunak quoted former US president John F Kennedy, saying the leaders gathered in San Diego were “United by that same purpose” of freedom, peace and security. He warned China, Russia, Iran and North Korea threatened to create “a world defined by danger, disorder, and division”. Praising Biden’s leadership and Albanese’s vision, Sunak said the UK would offer “over sixty years’ experience of running our own fleet” and the “world-leading design” for the Aukus class of submarines. “For the first time ever, it will mean three fleets of submarines working together across both the Atlantic and Pacific, keeping our oceans free, open, and prosperous for decades to come,” he said. Meanwhile as MPs in London debate the illegal migration bill Rishi Sunak is 8,000 miles away in San Diego unveiling details of the Aukus nuclear submarine pact. The press conference where Sunak would appear beside the US and Australian leaders, Joe Biden and Anthony Albanese, was supposed to be an hour ago but is just getting started now. You can read my colleague Aubrey Allegretti’s curtain raiser here Some Tory MPs are only able to support the illegal migration bill “because of the safeguards that are written into it”, the Conservative chairman of the justice select committee has said. Sir Bob Neill told the Commons: It is not unlawful or illegitimate, faced with new and novel developments in the means of entry into the United Kingdom unlawfully, to test the legal position. That’s what the bill does no more at this stage. It’s legitimate to do that. He went on: That said, some of us are only able to support this bill tonight because of the safeguards that are in written into it, for example habeas corpus, and others. Sir Bob noted that as the bill makes its way through the Commons and the Lords “some of us will be looking to improve the protections in relation to children, in relation to families, in relation to some of the tests”. He also insisted that “left on its own this bill, or any other bill, will not achieve anything”, adding: The real need is to operationalise the situation and to improve the lamentable performance our asylum system and immigration system has had for a number of years. The situation for asylum seekers in Knowsley has “deteriorated” since a protest outside their hotel – and some have been assaulted, the Labour MP for the area says. A protest last month outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Knowsley, Merseyside, saw a police van vandalised and fireworks thrown. The MP for the area, Labour former minister Sir George Howarth, says “we should all be ashamed” of the situation, while hitting out at the government’s illegal migration bill in the Commons. He says: I want to agree with the home secretary on one thing. And that is when she said we should choose our words carefully. It’s just a pity she didn’t do so herself. He adds: There is a hotel in Knowsley with 180-plus asylum seekers. I won’t talk about that in detail because I had an urgent question on it a few weeks ago. But what I will say is since then the situation has deteriorated to the extent that some of the refugees have been verbally abused in the street, and others have been assaulted. And they have fled because the countries they come from were unsafe, only to find themselves in an unsafe position in this country. And I think we should all be ashamed. It’s not just happening in Knowsley, it’s happening all over the country. The home secretary has said children will be exempt from detention and removal from UK under the illegal migration bill. Suella Braverman said the duty to remove “will not be applied to detain and remove unaccompanied asylum-seeking children”. She said: Consistent with current policy, only in limited circumstances, such as for the purposes of family reunion, we will remove unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from the UK. Otherwise, they will be provided with the necessary support in the UK until they reach 18. Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the government’s migration policy “a disgraceful piece of legislation” at a protest in Parliament Square this evening. The former Labour leader, who now sits as an independent MP, spoke at the ‘stop the bill’ protest, saying he believed the Illegal Migration Bill would lead to the UK’s removal from the European convention on human rights (ECHR). He said: I just heard the home secretary say they were going to shut down the people traffickers. The people traffickers exist because this policy creates a market for them and creates an opportunity for them to exploit people. Corbyn added that the bill contained “vile language” used to “dehumanise desperate groups of people”. Claudia Webbe, the independent MP for Leicester East, says it is “frankly frightening” to be at the second stage of a bill that begins with an admission from the home secretary “that the proposed legislation is not compatible with international law and our human rights obligations”. The former Labour MP tells the House of Commons that the European court of human rights was drafted by the UK and protects the rights of “every one of us”, despite “misrepresentation”. She adds: Not even children are safe under this bill. Whilst the bill does not instruct the deportation of unaccompanied children, it does give permission for their deportation if the government or home secretary so wishes. This is monstrous legislation and no assurances from the party opposite can make it less so. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrat Alistair Carmichael has said the bill would deprive entitled people to the right of asylum. He says: And what will be the consequence of that? They will be sent away and many of them will die. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, adds that he wants to see the government succeed in stopping the boats due to the “danger that dies for all those that try to make that route”. Labour MP Khalid Mahmood accuses home secretary Suella Braverman’s politics of being “xenophobic” and “racist”. He tells MPs in the Commons: The home secretary, in her opening statement, said that she can’t be xenophobic or racist just because of her colour and her origins. Well, I say to her, of the same colour and same origin, that that is exactly what her politics are about. Her politics are about dividing our society, our community, based on that. That is what she is doing and that is what she continues to do. The people of the United Kingdom are not so naive as to take this huge nonsense of xenophobia and racism from this party to be put forward. Elsewhere in the debate, Conservative former minister Sir John Hayes says: The plain fact is that our kingdom’s borders are being breached day after day with impunity. Of course Britain should provide a safe haven for people in need, in genuine need. But it is a deceit to pretend the asylum system is not being gamed and the British people taken for a ride. He adds that “economic migrants with no legal right to be here” are being “enabled by fat cat law firms, aided and abetted by militant interest groups who are determined to subvert the will of the people, and cheered on by vacuous self-indulgent celebrities leading millionaire lifestyles”. Aspana Begum, the Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, describes the bill as “abhorrent and unlawful”. She continues: Human rights and legal organisations are calling this one of the most damaging bills pushed forward by a British government in living memory. This is because the illegal migration bill amounts to a refugee ban. It breaches fundamental and internationally recognised human rights, it attacks our way of life and it attacks our communities all over the UK. Let us be clear; persecuting refugees and anti-migrant scaremongering does not benefit the majority of people. The cynical and dangerous use of scapegoating to divide people by an unpopular government, which has overseen a horrifying death toll during the pandemic and continues to inflict hardship and suffering across the UK, does damage our communities. Dame Diana Johnson, chair of the home affairs committee, has said the illegal migration bill “potentially leaves the Home Office in a legal quagmire”. She repeats the assertions from Labour and the SNP that it will result in a situation whereby tens of thousands of people are detained and “bailed into a permanent state of limbo”. She says: There is nothing specifically in this bill about tackling criminal gangs, people smugglers and traffickers. She concludes: We all want action on small boats. But what we want is effective action that will deal with the problem. The Conservative former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland says suggestions his party “is cruel, callous and that we don’t care about people” is “utterly, utterly wrong”. He highlights that he fought hard for the nationality and borders bill to make its way through the House of Commons, as justice secretary. He tells MPs: What our constituents are fed with is the seeming inability of the system to enforce the laws that we pass in this place, to get on with the jobs of lawful deportation, to make sure that people don’t overstay their visas. He adds that the small boats crisis “is actually the product of a successful approach we took when it came to the control of lorries”. He says: We succeeded in plugging that loophole and I’m pretty sure if we succeeded in plugging this loophole, another one would emerge. From all the evidence I know from asylum seekers I speak to in my constituency, and I do so regularly, this is a price-driven market. It is simply cheaper to come here on small boats than it is by other means at the moment. Buckland says the government is looking to use law, where operations – such as working with France and other countries – would have a better chance of working. He adds that “we have got to do more on safe and legal routes” in tandem with this legislation. Returning to Alison Thewliss’s (SNP) speech, she says there is no deal in existence with the EU and that Brexit has made the issue “much more difficult”. She adds: What this bill does do is create an underclass of people stuck in immigration limbo indefinitely. The bill will detain everybody arriving on a small boat for 28 days. The UK’s current detention capacity is 2,286 beds. The number of people crossing in small boats last year was 45,755 and, for context here, the prison population in England and Wales in 2022 was just over 81,000 people. So, where on earth does the home secretary suggest that the number of people she wishes to detain are kept, as well as those deemed inadmissible but unreturnable? Theresa May tells the shadow home secretary that under the Labour government the backlog of asylum cases rose to between 400,000 and 450,000. Intervening during Yvette Cooper’s speech, the Tory former prime minister says: If she thinks the current figure means the system is in chaos, then what was her description of the system under the Labour government of which she was a member, which had a backlog in asylum cases of between 400 and 450,000? Cooper replies: The former prime minister and former home secretary is experienced enough to know that is not an accurate characterisation. By the time the Labour government left office, the backlog of initial decisions was just a few thousand. Now it is 160,000 and in fact has trebled in the last few years as a result of the complete failure by the Conservative benches. Conservative former prime minister Theresa May has expressed concerns over the government’s immigration reforms. She tells the Commons: Anybody who thinks that this bill will deal with the issue of illegal migration once and for all is wrong. Opening her speech, May says: Having been home secretary for six years, I understand the pressures to deal with illegal migration. In my day, people were getting into backs of lorries and backs of cars of British tourists returning across the border at Calais. I did a deal with the French, the numbers went down. I have to say, I suspect it’s partly because of the success of that policy that we now see people coming in small boats. I welcome the new deal that’s been done with France because it will have an impact. But what should be clear from this is whenever you close a route, the migrants and the people smugglers find another way, and anybody who thinks that this bill will deal with the issue of illegal migration once and for all is wrong. Not least because a significant number, if not the majority, of people who are here illegally don’t come on small boats, they come legally and overstay their visas. Alison Thewliss, the SNP’s home office spokesperson, says “this refugee ban bill is nothing but an abhorrent dog whistle”. She says her SNP colleagues do not support it but do support a “functioning and fair immigration system, which is a million miles away from what we have now”. She adds: This bill has been rushed through with no proper impact assessment, on the back of legislation barely even in place. Yvette Cooper goes on to question what has happened to the Conservative party that “once voted to introduce the modern slavery bill”, adding that they were “right to do so”. She says: How low have they fallen and how far down are they trying to drag our proud country? Because that is what this is. It is an attempt to drag our whole country down. They know this bill won’t work to stop boat crossings or to stop the gangs, they know it won’t clear the backlog, they know it will make the chaos worse. She adds that it will “undermine our reputation in the eyes of the world as a country that believes in the rule of law”. She says the Tories don’t care and it is all about political gain. Sunak just wants to pick a fight, Cooper says. “All he wants is someone else to blame,” she says. Suella Braverman says Rwanda “has the capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people if necessary”. She tells MPs about detention in the UK: We are expanding detention capacity with two new immigration removal centres, but clearly we are not building capacity to detain 40,000 people, nor do we need to. The aim of this bill is not to detain people, but to swiftly remove them. She adds: Arguments that our approach cannot work because Rwanda lacks capacity are wrong. Let me be clear, our partnership with Rwanda is uncapped. We stand ready to operationalise it at scale as soon as is legally practicable. It is understandable that Rwanda has not procured thousands of beds to accommodate arrivals while legal challenges are ongoing. Intervening, Labour shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper says: The home secretary has just admitted that Rwanda doesn’t have thousands of places. She will know that the Rwandan government has talked about taking a few hundred people … where is she expecting to send the tens of thousands of people expected to arrive in the UK this year? Braverman responds: [The agreement with Rwanda] is uncapped and potentially Rwanda could accommodate high numbers of people that we seek to relocate. Rwanda has the capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people if necessary. Home secretary Suella Braverman said the duty to remove “will not be applied to detain and remove unaccompanied asylum-seeking children”. She told MPs: Given the mischaracterisation of the bill from members opposite, I would like to make a few things clear. The home secretary’s duty to remove will not be applied to detain and remove unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. Consistent with current policy, only in limited circumstances, such as for the purposes of family reunion, we will remove unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from the UK. Otherwise, they will be provided with the necessary support in the UK until they reach 18. With respect to the removal of families and pregnant women, it bears repeating that the overwhelming majority of illegal arrivals are adult men under the age of 40. Removing them will be our primary focus. But we must not create incentives for the smugglers to focus on people with particular characteristics by signposting exemptions for removal. It is right that we retain powers to adapt our policy so that we can respond to any change in tactics by the smuggling gangs. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative MP, says “everybody knows you are caught on average once by French police on the beaches”. Those hoping to cross the Channel come back the next day, he says. He insists the only way to stop the boats is to support the government’s legislation. Yvette Cooper, however, says he is “kidding himself” if he thinks the bill will change anything. She repeats the claim that tens of thousands of asylum seekers will be added to the backlog, costing “billions”. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, describes the bill as a “con” and says the reality is Braverman is creating misinformation and that her plan will “unravel”. She says the home secretary has already got power to fast-track returns to Albania, with 99% of cases remaining in limbo. She says: The real problem is Conservative Home Office ministers don’t have any grip on the system they are supposed to be in charge of. Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters have gathered in Parliament Square to protest against the government’s Illegal Migration Bill. Zrinka Bralo, CEO of Migrants Organise, said: We are here to stand up for dignity and justice and speak out against this new bill, which is further dehumanising and demonising refugees and is damaging our democracy. Protesters chanted “money for health and education not for war and deportation” as many held placards reading “refugees always welcome”, PA Media reported. Other chants included “say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here”, and “who built the NHS, migrants built the NHS”. Yvette Cooper says Suella Braverman’s plan will mean tens of thousands more people in asylum accommodation and hotels and will not clear the backlog. She says it won’t deliver safe and managed alternatives, resulting in children being locked up. It will deny citizenship for people like Mo Farah, she adds. Theresa May, the former home secretary and former PM, said the government bill will allow people to be removed from the UK quickly. But the memorandum with Rwanda about the Rwanda deal said the UK would screen asylum seekers first, she said. How would that be possible if people were being removed quickly. Braverman claimed the UK screening process was robust. My colleague Tom Ambrose is taking over now. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the last home secretary passed a law to make people crossing the Channel in small boats ineligible for asylum. But just 21 people have been removed as result, she said. This graphic in an IfG report illustrates this. Braverman said those figures did not include other people who had been removed, such as those removed to Albania. Braverman accuses oppositon MPs of not having any proposals to stop small boat crossings. She says that in practice they favour open borders. They are trying to deceive the public, she argues, because they are “dressing what is an extreme political argument in the fake garb of humanitarianism”. She tells MPs: The way to stop these deaths is to stop the boats. Secondly, the critics ignore that our policy does, in fact, guarantee humanitarian protection for those who genuinely need it. Our policy is profoundly and at heart a humane attempt to break the incentive that sustains the business model of the smuggling gangs. She adds: Crucially, if people are truly in need of protection, they will receive protection in Rwanda. Joanna Cherry (SNP) said gay and trans people were not protected by anti-discrimination laws in Rwanda. She asked Braverman if she thought it was a safe country. Braverman said the Rwanda deal had been approved by the courts. John Redwood (Con) asked Braverman if she was concerned that people crossing the Channel on small boats were linked to criminality. Braverman said she had spoken to police chiefs, and they told her that criminality, and the drug trade, were linked to people who had come to the UK on small boats. Braverman says she has been the subject of “grotesque slurs” just for saying “simple truths about the impact of unlimited and illegal migration”. She says the same thing happened to Priti Patel when she was home secretary. But she won’t be put off by “out of touch lefties”, she says. Claims that government policies backed by the majority of British people are bigoted are “irresponsible”, she says. Braverman says there is nothing inconsistent in someone like her, the child of immigrants, saying that immigration has been been overwhelmingly good for the country, but that that there has been “too much of it in recent years”. And she says uncontrolled and illegal immigration is “simply bad”. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, is speaking now. She says stopping the boats is her top priority. She says polls suggest the public support the bill by a margin of two to one. The debate on the illegal migration bill is about to start. As Nigel Evans, the deputy speaker, was about to call Suella Braverman, the home secretary, the Labour MP Clive Lewis rose to make a point of order, pointing out that the bill includes a statement saying it might not be compatible with the European convention on human rights. He claimed that on that basis the debate should not even go ahead. Rishi Sunak has been giving interviews in California. Speaking to ITV’s Robert Peston, he said the government will not try to influence the outcome of the privileges committee inquiry into claims Boris Johnson misled MPs about Partygate. Asked if he would try to persuade Tory members of the committee not to impose too tough a punishment on Johnson if they found him in the wrong, Sunak replied: That wouldn’t be right. This is a matter for parliament and the house. It’s not a matter for the government. And asked if the government might intervene to try to stop Johnson being suspended from the Commons for 10 days or more, a move that could trigger a recall byelection, Sunak replied: No, again, this is a matter for parliament, for the house. It’s not right for the government to get involved. The normal practice with inquiries of this kind is for the privileges committee to make a recommendation at the end of its inquiry and, if that involves an MP facing a sanction, for the Commons to vote to approve it. Normally there is not even a vote, because MPs accept the committee’s recommendations, and if there is a division, it is not normally seen as a party political matter. But when Boris Johnson was PM, he did order Tory MPs to vote down a standards committee recommendation for Owen Paterson to be suspended. That was seen as a massive mistake, and within days the government backed down. If the privileges committee does propose suspending Johnson, some of his most loyal supporters (and pro-Johnson papers like the Daily Mail) might expect Sunak to tell Tory MPs to vote against the punishment. Sunak is making it clear this will not happen. Politicians, in all parties, often start of quite radical but, if they go into government, end up mellowing, tamed by pragmatism and first-hand exposure to the establishment. But not Theresa May. On the basis of the publicity for a book she is publishing later this year, she is going the other way. According to the blurb from Waterstones, the former PM will be “railing against the corruption and self-enrichment she sees as endemic in modern Parliamentary politics”. Perhaps Jeremy Corbyn is going to help her write it. In a quote describing the book published by the Bookseller, May says that what she was in government she saw “public institutions abusing their power” over and over again. She says: When I stood on the steps of No 10 as prime minister for the first time I set out my determination to fight burning injustices and govern not for the powerful but for the people. Time and time again, during my period in government, I saw public institutions abusing their power by seeking to defend themselves in the face of challenge rather than seek the truth. These were the very bodies whose job was to protect the public, but they sought to protect themselves. From Hillsborough to Primodos to child sexual exploitation this increased the suffering of victims and delayed justice. Our democracy depends on people having trust in their public institutions and politicians. I am delighted to be working with Headline as the accounts I give in this book show how that trust has been eroded over time and why we need to act. The synopsis of the book says: As prime minister for three years and home secretary for six years, Theresa May confronted a series of issues in which the abuse of power led to devastating results for individuals and significantly damaged the reputation of, and trust in, public institutions and politicians. From the Hillsborough and Grenfell tragedies, to the Daniel Morgan case and parliamentary scandals, the powerful repeatedly chose to use their power not in the interests of the powerless but to serve themselves or to protect the organisation to which they belonged. The Abuse of Power is a searing exposé of injustice and an impassioned call to exercise power for the greater good. Drawing on examples from domestic and international affairs she was personally involved in at the highest level, including Stop and Search and the Salisbury Poisonings, the former prime minister argues for a radical rethink in how we approach our politics and public life. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader and one of the most prominent China hawks in the party, used his question to James Cleverly in the statement on the integrated review to mock the government’s new approach. He said that, when Rishi Sunak was standing for the leadership last summer, he described China as a “systemic threat”. That was later watered down to “systemic challenge”, and treating China with “robust pragmatism”. He went on: That robust pragmatism meant that we have sanctioned nobody in Hong Kong, when America has sanctioned 10; that we have sanctioned three low officials in Xinjiang, when America has sanctioned 11, including Chen Quanguo, the architect of that terrible atrocity; and we did not kick out the Chinese officials who beat people up on the streets of the UK. But now I understand that [China is seen as] an epoch-defining challenge. I just want to ask, in the document that the prime minister has produced today, in the same paragraph he does refer to that epoch-defining challenge. But then he goes on to say that this is in the face of that “threat”. Does this now mean that China is a threat? Or an epoch-defining challenge? Or a challenging government epoch? Or even none of that? In reply, James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said he could understand the desire to sum up the policy towards China with a single phrase. But he said with a country as big and as significant as China, it was not possible to make it that simple. Here is a key passage in the integrated review refresh explaining government policy to China. It says: The UK’s China policy is being updated to respond to two overarching factors that have continued to evolve since IR2021: i. First, China’s size and significance on almost every global issue, which will continue to increase in the years ahead in ways that will be felt in the UK and around the world. China is a long-standing permanent member of the UN Security Council. It now accounts for nearly a fifth of the world economy and is a major investor in the developing world. It is highly advanced in several industrial, scientific and technological fields, and plays a vital role in many global supply chains of importance to the UK. As the world’s largest investor in sustainable energy and the largest emitter of carbon, the choices that China makes are critical to our collective ability to tackle climate change. In other areas such as global health and pandemic preparedness, decisions taken by China have the potential to have profound impact on our lives at home. ii. Second, the UK’s growing concerns about the actions and stated intent of the CCP. Since IR2021, it has chosen to strengthen its partnership with Russia just as Russia pursued its invasion of Ukraine, and continued to disregard universal human rights and its international commitments, from Tibet and Xinjiang to Hong Kong. Its ‘new multilateralism’ is challenging the centrality of human rights and freedoms in the UN system. It has pursued rapid and opaque military modernisation with huge new investments, militarised disputed islands in the South China Sea, and refused to renounce the use of force to achieve its objectives with regard to Taiwan. It has used economic power to coerce countries with which it disagrees, such as Lithuania. The CCP has sanctioned British parliamentarians and acted in other ways to undermine free speech. And as the Director General of MI5 identified publicly last year, it has engaged in both espionage and interference in the UK. The UK does not accept that China’s relationship with the UK or its impact on the international system are set on a predetermined course. Our preference is for better cooperation and understanding, and predictability and stability for global public good. But we believe that this will depend on the choices China makes, and will be made harder if trends towards greater authoritarianism and assertiveness overseas continue. The UK’s policy towards China will therefore be anchored in our core national interests and our higher interest in an open and stable international order, based on the UN Charter and international law. Where it is consistent with these interests, we will engage constructively with the Chinese government, business and people and cooperate on shared priorities. But wherever the CCP’s actions and stated intent threaten the UK’s interests, we will take swift and robust action to protect them. This is the template for mature diplomacy between two P5 nations and is aligned with the approaches adopted by our closest allies and partners, including those in Europe, the US, Australia, Canada and Japan. By comparision, this is what the original integrated review, published in March 2021, said about China. Since then, the language has been toughened – although not as much as some Conservatives want. China as a systemic competitor. China’s increasing power and international assertiveness is likely to be the most significant geopolitical factor of the 2020s. The scale and reach of China’s economy, size of its population, technological advancement and increasing ambition to project its influence on the global stage, for example through the Belt and Road Initiative, will have profound implications worldwide. Open, trading economies like the UK will need to engage with China and remain open to Chinese trade and investment, but they must also protect themselves against practices that have an adverse effect on prosperity and security. Cooperation with China will also be vital in tackling transnational challenges, particularly climate change and biodiversity loss … China’s growing international stature is by far the most significant geopolitical factor in the world today, with major implications for British values and interests and for the structure and shape of the international order. The fact that China is an authoritarian state, with different values to ours, presents challenges for the UK and our allies. China will contribute more to global growth than any other country in the next decade with benefits to the global economy. China and the UK both benefit from bilateral trade and investment, but China also presents the biggest state-based threat to the UK’s economic security. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee, says many MPs hoped that previous cuts to the defence budget would be cut today. The world is sliding towards a new cold war, but the government is maintaining a peacetime budget. He says the government should move to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence now. Cleverly says the government has committed to 2.5% as a sustainable baseline. He says the government will continue to assess threats, and make sure policy is aligned to deal with them. Alicia Kearns, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, says she welcomes much of what is in the revised integrated review. But she says China should not just be seen as an economic threat. She urges the government to show greater resolve in dealing with Chinese oppression, for example, by shutting down their illegal police stations abroad. Cleverly says the government considers that the threat from China is not just economic. The updated integrated review includes a foreword from Rishi Sunak. This is what he says in it about China. China poses an epoch-defining challenge to the type of international order we want to see, both in terms of security and values – and so our approach must evolve. We will work with our partners to engage with Beijing on issues such as climate change. But where there are attempts by the Chinese Communist party to coerce or create dependencies, we will work closely with others to push back against them. And we are taking new action to protect ourselves, our democracy and our economy at home. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, says the original integrated review had some serious shortcomings. He says it did not see the risk of the Taliban taking over Kabul, and it did not anticipate the invasion of Ukraine. He says it did not even mention Taiwan. He says it said almost nothing about the EU. And he says the rhetoric in the document, on topics such as the fight against kleptocracy and the importance of international law, contrasted poorly with what the government was doing. Cleverly is now setting out highlights from the review that were briefed overnight. Cleverly says the updated review sets out how the government will respond to China. He says the government “cannot be blind to the increasingly aggressive military and economic behaviour of the Chinese Communist party, including stoking tensions across the Taiwan Strait and attempts to strong-arm partners”. Cleverly starts by saying the integrated review published two years ago set out how the UK would thrive in a more complicated age. It showed how the government would use “the combined might of every part of government to ensure that our country remains safe, prosperous and influential into the 2030s”, he says. He says the approach was right. He goes on: On every continent of the world, the United Kingdom walks taller today than it has done for many years. This provokes some laughter. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, is now making his statement to MPs about the updated integrated defence and security review. Deltapoll has polling out today giving Labour a 23-point lead over the Conservatives – up seven points on the previous week. James Johnson, a pollster who used to work for Theresa May, has highlighted these figures showing Rishi Sunak’s approval ratings going up in recent weeks, particularly among people who voted Tory in 2019. Humza Yousaf has said he would shift the campaign for independence into “fifth gear” if he wins the SNP leadership, following a suggestion from a colleague that it should “go down a gear”, PA Media reports. Ben Macpherson, the minister for social security in the Scottish government, said it would take longer than the short or medium term for Scotland to become a successful independent country. Writing in Scotland on Sunday yesterday, Macpherson said: Any reckless, overly disruptive path to statehood would quickly make our quality of life in Scotland poorer. Better to go down a gear and take the journey at a reasonably safe speed than crash trying to rush things. Today, on a visit to Stirling, Yousaf, the health secretary in the Scottish government and one of the three SNP leadership candidates, said he disagreed. Asked about Macpherson’s comment, he replied: I have the opposite view, I think we should be ramping up, not ramping down activity. If I was the first minister I’d put us into fifth gear – let alone take it down a gear. There’s a number of prospectus papers I would commit to publishing around the case for independence as soon as I become first minister. But also, on day one, we’ve got to kick start the Yes movement. Kate Forbes, the finance secretary and Yousaf’s main rival, also said she disagreed with Macpherson suggestion that independence should be made less of an immediate goal, and more of a long term one. She said: I would fundamentally disagree [with Macpherson]. I think we have learned lessons of how not to do it from Brexit, but I think you can be far more effective in laying the groundwork from the very beginning. I think the nature of the transition is that it’s gradual, but I would distance myself from the assumption that it would take decades, or indeed many, many years. Yousaf and Forbes, who are the two frontrunners in the contest, have both been accused of favouring a more gradual approach to independence than Nicola Sturgeon. Ash Regan, the former community safety minister who is the third candidate in the contest, appears to prioritise independence more than her rivals. She has said she thinks Scotland could get independence without a referendum if enough voters back pro-independence parties. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee, has expressed concern about the illegal migration bill. In an interview with BBC News he said that, if called to speak in the debate this afternoon, he would ask how someone, from Somalia, for example, could legitimately claim asylum in the UK without having to cross the Channel in a small boat. “When we have [the answer to] that, then we do have a solution,” he said, implying that in its current state the bill was flawed. Chris Skidmore, the Conservative former minister who did a net zero review for the government and who is standing down at the next election, has said he will not vote for the illegal migration bill tonight. Caroline Nokes, another former Tory minister, has also said she will not vote for the bill. She said the proposals filled her with “absolute horror”. Two MPs abstaining does not constitute a significant rebellion. But what Nokes and Skidmore have shown is that the bill does not have universal support on the government backbenches. As Michael Savage and Toby Helm reported in the Observer yesterday, “a potential Tory rebellion [is] already brewing over the proposals”. There are even reports that Priti Patel, the former home secretary, may speak out against parts of the bill. These are from Ben Zaranko, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has posted a thread on Twitter about the significance of Rishi Sunak saying he wants to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP “in the longer term”. It starts here. And here are some of the points he is making. And this is from Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS (and Zaranko’s boss). Many Tories were furious with Gary Lineker for comparing the language used by the government to discuss migrants with what was said in Nazi Germany. More than 30 MPs and peers reportedly signed a letter saying Lineker should apologise “at the very least”. It was organised by the Common Sense group, a rightwing Tory caucus particularly hostile to liberalism. But not all rightwingers think the same way. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary, is more libertarian than his Common Sense colleagues and he told GB News this morning that he was “not fussed” about Lineker criticising the govenrment. Rees-Mogg, who also presents a show on the station, said: I think those of us broadly on the right have to be very, very careful about attacking people for freedom of speech, so I’m not fussed about what he says. But Rees-Mogg did argue that the row strengthened the case for the abolition of the BBC licence fee. He said: [Lineker] can say what he likes. The issue is that the BBC is the state broadcaster and that it’s funded by a tax on televisions. If it weren’t, then we wouldn’t need to worry about its impartiality. Actually, if we change the funding mechanism of the BBC, we could have a much freer media, as they do in the United States, where people are allowed to say what they think. I think that would be much better rather than this pretence that the BBC is impartial, which it isn’t, and then having rows about particular presenters. Asked about the licence fee at the morning lobby briefing, the No 10 spokesperson said: We remain committed to the licence fee for the rest of the current charter. But we’ve been clear that the BBC’s funding model faces major challenges due to changes in the way people consume media. And it’s necessary to look at ways to ensure long-term sustainability. The BBC’s current charter runs out in 2027. At the No 10 lobby briefing the spokesperson said the government was glad that the BBC’s dispute with Gary Lineker had been resolved. He said: We’re pleased that this situation has been resolved and that fans will be able to watch Match of the Day as normal this weekend. The spokesperson repeated the line used previously about Rishi Sunak being “disappointed” by the language used by Lineker in relation to the government’s small boats policy, and the rhetoric used by ministers, but the spokesperson declined to say Lineker should apologise. The spokesperson also declined to offer full backing to Richard Sharp, the BBC chair (and Sunak’s former boss at Goldman Sachs). No 10 is still waiting for the outcome of the review into the appointment process being carried out by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, the spokesperson said. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons defence committee, told Sky News this morning that the extra £5bn for defence announced by Rishi Sunak was not enough. Pointing out that Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, was lobbying for twice that sum, Ellwood said that extra £5bn, although welcome, would not reverse the cuts to defence spending in the last defence review. He also claimed that countries like Russia and China would be “breathing a sigh of relief”. He said: The next couple of years are going to get very, very dangerous indeed. This year particularly, 2023, will be critical for Ukraine. Britain has done brilliantly in stepping forward, pushing the envelope, because we have become rather risk averse, too timid, in dealing with aggressive nations such as Russia and China. But we can only do that with the hard power. And I think Russia and China will be breathing a sigh of relief that we have not invested further in our armed forces at this time. We are at the foothills of another cold war. Globalisation in its current form is actually dying. And it’s countries like Britain that usually step forward and other nations follow. We can only do that if we invest further in our defence. There are no urgent questions in the Commons today, which means James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, will deliver his statement on “IR23”, the update to the integrated defence and security review, at 3.30pm. After that is over, Andrew Griffith, a Treasury minister, will give a statment on the sale of the UK arm of the Silicon Valley Bank. The Foreign Office has confirmed that, as part of the integrated defence and security review update being published today, BBC World Service will get an extra £20m. It says this will protected its 42 language services for the next two years. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said: As the world’s most trusted international broadcaster, the BBC World Service is a vital tool in providing accurate and impartial news, analysis and discussion in 42 languages to 365 million people around the world each week. This one-off funding will allow the BBC World Service to maintain its unrivalled status as the world’s largest international broadcaster, and to continue playing its crucial role in tackling harmful disinformation through providing trusted, impartial news and analysis globally. Last year the Foreign Office said it was spending £94m a year on the World Service. MPs will vote on the illegal migration bill at 10pm tonight after the second reading debate. In a clear and hard-hitting report on the legislation, the Institute for Government thinktank says there are seven questions ministers need to answer to explain how it might work. The IfG says: Without increased capacity to remove people, classifying ever more arrivals as inadmissible will not help the government reduce the backlog or the money spent on accommodation – or improve public trust in the immigration system. And at a human level, it has the potential to cause serious harm to vulnerable people. Keir Starmer has urged the government to negotiate an end to the strike by junior doctors taking place in England today. He said: The way to resolve strikes is to get around the table and to negotiate and compromise and come to a settlement. That’s what the government needs to do. Many people will be really anxious today. They know there isn’t full emergency cover, they know that operations are now going to be cancelled, including in serious areas like cancer. So the anxiety this will put upon people who rely on the NHS is huge. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has rejected a claim by Labour that taxes are higher in Scotland for higher earners because the SNP has mismanaged the economy. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, made that claim on a visit to Scotland. As the Times reports, Reeves said: The way I see it is the last Labour government was able to keep taxes low and invest in public services and we were able to do it because we grew the economy. When Labour was last in power — and we were in for 13 years —the average growth rate per year was 2.1%. The average growth rate the last 13 years under the Tories has been 1.4%. And taxes are at the highest level of being in the UK for 70 years. The Conservatives have become a high-tax party and the SNP too because they become low-growth parties … We’ve got to grow the economy. In response, Sturgeon said taxes were higher for higher earners in Scotland because the Scottish government was more committed to redistribution than the UK government. She said the fact that Labour did not support the SNP on this showed it was “Tory-lite”. Increasingly the Scottish government has been using its powers under devolution to set income tax rates that are different from those applying in the rest of the UK. In a recent report, the Institute for Fiscal Studies explained the difference. It said: The Scottish income tax system has more bands and different rates compared with the rest of the UK. The effect is that income tax liabilities are a very small amount lower in Scotland for those on less than £28,000 per year, but greater for those on higher incomes – sometimes by quite large margins. For example, someone on £50,000 will pay £1,550 more tax in Scotland than in the rest of the UK, and someone on £150,000 will pay £3,900 more, in the coming tax year. The IFS report also backed up Sturgeon’s analysis. It said the Scottish government had used its powers “to make the system more progressive, as well as to raise more revenue to fund public services”. Keir Starmer has said Richard Sharp should resign as chair of the BBC. As ITV reports, this morning Starmer said: I think Richard Sharp’s position is increasingly untenable. I think most people watching the complete mess of the last few days would say how on earth is he still in position and Gary Lineker has been taken off air? This is a mess of the BBC’s own making, they need to sort it out and sort it out fast. As Jessica Elgot reports, Starmer is echoing what Lucy Powell, the shadow culture secretary, said yesterday. Powell also described Sharp’s position at “increasingly untenable”. Even before the Gary Lineker row erupted, Sharp was already facing calls for his resignation because, when applying for the job of BBC chair, he did not disclose his role in helping Boris Johnson get access to a loan facility, reportedly worth around £800,000. Here is the No 10 readout of the meeting between Rishi Sunak and Anthony Albanese, his Australian counterpart, in San Diego last night. They agreed Aukus was “an unprecedented endeavour which will protect our people and support our defence industrial bases for generations to come”, No 10 says. Richard Dannatt, a peer and a former head of the army, has told the Sun he does not think the extra £5bn for defence announced today (see 9.24am) goes far enough. He told the paper: This government is beginning to look like an ostrich over defence spending. The parallels to the 1930s grow stronger – a threat from a dictator in Europe and a refusal to reinvest or rearm. Junior hospital doctors in England started a 72-hour strike this morning. My colleagues Denis Campbell and Aubrey Allegretti have the story. This morning Prof Philip Banfield, the chair of the BMA’s council, claimed that, paradoxically, hospitals could be safer than normal, because elective operations won’t be taking place and because more senior doctors, consultants, would be covering for the doctors on strike. He told the Today programme: What is going to happen over this next three days is that we are going to see senior doctors – I don’t like the words junior and senior, this is just a level of experience and training – so we’re seeing consultants and specialist doctors cover. They will stop, or should stop, their elective work and actually the NHS is maintaining a great deal of elective work. So we should see that the service is safe. In fact, actually, we should see it is even safer than normal. Asked to explain that, he said: Because the care is going to be given by consultants, consultants seeing patients, doing things that they normally wouldn’t do. The SNP leadership debate on Sky News this evening will start at 7pm, not 8pm, as the agenda originally stated. I’ve corrected that now. Some sources were wrongly saying 8pm. This is from Jonathan Beale, the BBC’s defence correspondent, on today’s defence spending announcement. (See 9.24am.) My colleague Caroline Davies will be covering all the details of the Gary Lineker story, and the BBC’s climbdown, on a separate live blog. Lineker has responded to the BBC announcement in a Twitter thread starting here. And he is still speaking out in defence of refugees. Tim Davie, the BBC director general, has issued a statement announcing that Gary Lineker is going back on air. In it he says that there are “grey areas” in the corporation’s guidance on the use of social media, that this has caused “potential confusion”, and he adds: “I apologise for this”. He says the guidelines will be reviewed by an independent expert, with a particular focus on how they should apply to freelance broadcasters operating outside news and current affairs (such as Lineker). The guidelines should be “clear, proportionate and appropriate”, he says. Sky’s Rob Harris has tweeted the full statement. Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian’s defence editor, has written an analysis of the defence spending announcement (see 9.24am) and the integrated review update. Here is an extract. China, previously “a systemic competitor” – a phrase generally useful, if unmemorable – has upgraded to presenting an “epoch-defining challenge” – as a nod to the Conservative backbenchers who had wanted Beijing to be designated as a threat, similar to that used to describe Russia. This, in fact, was Truss’s reason for reopening the integrated review, to make such an aggressive re-designation that would only have further inflamed already fraught relations with Beijing. Epoch-defining is a large notion, not least because epochs tend to be very long, while integrated reviews emerge every two years, and if Labour wins, the party is likely to want to refocus on Russia, if, that is, the US allows them. Nevertheless “epoch-defining” also suggests the world is becoming a different kind of unsafe place. Islamist fundamentalism is in retreat, fallen sharply after the territorial defeat of Islamic State and the killing of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In its place is a rapprochement between Russia and China, state actors with larger budgets, more weaponry and sophisticated tools at their disposal. This thinking underlies Sunak’s announcement to recommit to a target of lifting defence spending to 2.5% of GDP “in the longer term”, similar to what was announced by Johnson at the last Nato summit in June, one of his last acts before his premiership collapsed. Johnson, however, put a target date – 2030 – on when the pledge would be met, and Sunak has not. And here is the full article. The government has struck a last-minute deal for HSBC to buy Silicon Valley Bank’s UK operations, saving thousands of British tech startups and investors from big losses after the biggest bank failure since 2008, my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff reports. My colleague Graeme Wearden has more coverage on his business live blog. According to Rob Harris from Sky News, Gary Lineker will return to his Match of the Day presenting job on the BBC. Harris also claims that Lineker will get some sort of apology from the BBC. Lineker was taken off air at the weekend, prompting many of his football presenter colleagues to stage what was in effect a mini-strike in solidarity, after a tweet criticising the language used by ministers about the government’s illegal migration bill prompted both Tory fury and claims he had breached BBC impartiality guidelines. Good morning. Rishi Sunak is in San Diego, California, where today he will meet Joe Biden, the US president, and Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister, for an Aukus meeting. Aukus is the Australia/US/UK security pact, primarily focused on providing Australia with nuclear-powered submarine capacity. It was set up when Boris Johnson was prime minister, and now provides him with the material for one of his most over-used jokes. The meeting will coincide with the publication of the government’s update (or “refresh”, as it is officially called) to the integrated review of security, defence, development and foreign policy first published in 2021. Liz Truss ordered the update during her short-lived premiership, because she wanted it to take a tougher line on China. IR23, as the “refresh” is also called by No 10, will be published this afternoon. Overnight, Sunak announced that the Ministry of Defence will get an extra £5bn over the next two years as part of the review, and that the government is committing to raising defence spending to 2.5% of GDP “in the longer term”. In a news release No 10 says: The 2023 integrated review refresh [IR23] confirms that an additional £5bn will be provided to the Ministry of Defence over the next two years, to help replenish and bolster vital ammunition stocks, modernise the UK’s nuclear enterprise and fund the next phase of the Aukus submarine programme. It follows a £24bn four-year uplift in defence spending in 2020, the largest sustained increase since the cold war. The prime minister will also set out an ambition to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP in the longer term, and the UK will lead a conversation with Allies on future posture and burden sharing at the Nato summit in Lithuania this summer. We will review defence spending after 2025 in light of this ambition. As my colleague Aubrey Allegretti reports, Conservative MPs are particularly interested in what IR23 will say about China and, speaking to reporters on his flight to California, Rishi Sunak said it was too simplistic just to categorise China as a “threat” (which is what China hawks in his party want). Sunak said: I don’t think it’s kind of smart or sophisticated foreign policy to reduce our relationship with China – which, after all, is a country with 1.5bn people, the second biggest economy, and member of the UN security council – to just two words. That’s why in the integrated review you will see a very thoughtful and detailed approach to China … I think [China] presents an epoch-defining challenge to us and to the global order. Aubrey’s full story is here. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Keir Starmer is doing a visit ahead of the budget on Wednesday. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, is due to make a Commons statement about the integrated review refresh. Around 3.30pm UK time: Rishi Sunak records a series of broadcast interviews in San Diego. After 5.30pm: MPs start the second reading debate for the illegal migration bill. 7pm: Sky News hosts a debate for the SNP leadership candidates. 7.30pm: Sunak meets Joe Biden, the US president, and Anthony Albanese, the Australian PM, at the Aukus meeting. Sunak will also have a bilateral meeting with Biden. I’ll try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it.

                    "headline": "Size of UK’s nuclear submarine fleet could double under Aukus plans",
                    "bodyText": "The UK’s nuclear-powered submarine fleet could double in size as plans were revealed for the new “Aukus” vessels to be based on a British design. In a bid to counter the growing threat from China, the UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, vowed alongside his US and Australian counterparts to stand “shoulder to shoulder” to protect peace in the Indo-Pacific given its implications for security across the world. A “historic” deal 18 months in the making was announced by the three leaders in Point Loma, San Diego, that will see new Aukus submarines seaworthy from the late 2030s. They will be based on a British design, with some made in the UK by BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce – principally in Barrow-in-Furness. The new submarines will replace the current seven nuclear-powered vessels used by the UK – but more could be added, taking the potential size of the fleet to 19. The Aukus security pact, which military top brass believe is the most significant for Britain since the US helped it become one of the few nuclear powers in 1958, will see Australia become only the seventh such country in the world to gain nuclear powered submarines. Australia expects to receive delivery of its own submarines in the early 2040s. In the mean time, British submarines will start to be rotated to Australia from as early as 2027 to build the country’s knowledge, workforce and infrastructure in preparation. This year, more senior Australian officers will start training on US and UK submarine bases, with the US hoping to sell Australia three Virginia class submarines and a further two if needed. China has sought to sow doubts about the project, arguing it would have a “grave nuclear proliferation risk” and could violate an international treaty. But the three Aukus countries said they had set the highest standard and worked closely with the International Atomic Energy Agency. For more than 60 years, they argued, the UK and US have operated more than 500 naval nuclear reactors that have collectively travelled more than 150m miles without incident. Speaking in California on Monday, Sunak, US president Joe Biden, and Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese vowed the move would contribute to “global security and stability”. In the face of concerns about growing military and economic hostility from China, the three leaders said in a joint statement: “For more than a century, our three nations have stood shoulder to shoulder, along with other allies and partners, to help sustain peace, stability, and prosperity around the world, including in the Indo-Pacific. “We believe in a world that protects freedom and respects human rights, the rule of law, the independence of sovereign states, and the rules-based international order.” Quoting former US president John F Kennedy who visited San Diego and spoke of the importance of freedom, peace and stability in 1957, Sunak said the Aukus powers were “united by that same purpose”. He targeted China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, saying they threatened to create “a world defined by danger, disorder, and division”. Although Britain’s closest threat geographically is Russia, given its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, defence figures believe that the growing threat will emerge from China. If the ice caps in the Arctic continue to melt, there are concerns China’s surplus naval fleet could begin to operate on Europe’s doorstep. With Taiwan holding elections next year, some western countries fear that could provide the impetus for an attempt by China to seize control of the island. Aukus is not anticipated to create a domino effect – meaning it will probably remain a three-way trilateral relationship rather than bringing other countries into the pact. However, the UK government is confident it has captured the imagination of observers and hopes they will align with the Aukus objectives. That could include more military joint exercises, but go as far as prompting a re-think of relying too heavily on Chinese investment and trade ties. While Sunak said this week China posed an “epoch-defining challenge” to the world order, he has resisted classifying the country as a “threat” in the updated integrated defence review. The prime minister faced down hawks in his own party who want him to take a stronger approach, as he does not believe that deteriorating relations with Beijing are inevitable. He told journalists on Monday: “We don’t believe it’s on a predetermined course.” Engagement with China remains “sensible and responsible”, Sunak said. He added: “But we can’t be blind or naive to the challenge it poses.”"

                    "bodyText": "You’d have thought the Tories would have wanted to give their illegal migration bill – insert your own gags – a good send-off for its second reading. But Rishi Sunak chose to be 8,000 miles away in San Diego. Far away from the scene of the crime. And the government also insisted on two ministerial statements – one of them hardly pressing – to delay the debate until late in the day. Almost as if they wanted it over and done with. As it was the government benches were half empty. Most of the saner Tories had decided to give it a swerve. Not brave enough to speak out in the chamber. The debate started with a point of order from Labour’s Clive Lewis. The bill came with its own health warning that there was a less that 50/50 chance of the government surviving a legal challenge. So why waste parliament’s time? Surely it would be better to let the courts battle this one out first. Suella Braverman disagreed. Labour hadn’t understood. This wasn’t how it worked. What was going to happen was that the UK was going to kick asylum seekers out regardless of international law. A cunning plan to turn us into a rogue state. “The British people aren’t xenophobic,” the home secretary said. Though she was very much hoping she could persuade them to be. We’ve been accused of inflammatory rhetoric, added Braverman. Er yes … guilty as charged. By now the home secretary was looking surprised. Bewildered, even. Now Suella became lachrymose. Some people had made outrageous slurs about her. Indeed they had. Some of her own MPs had said she was a competent, humane home secretary. Tory Richard Graham tried to defend her only to precipitate a pile on from the SNP. Theresa May was the only quizzical voice on the Conservative benches. How did Suella square deporting everyone regardless with our duty to screen refugees properly before sending them to Rwanda? Suella merely shrugged. It was full-on delusional. And the people aren’t as nasty as her. The Tories are still 20 points behind in the polls. Earlier on, the foreign secretary made a statement on the integrated review refresh. Or rather, he merely repeated everything that had been briefed earlier. Only at much greater length. James Cleverly is not a man to use one word where several will do. His real tragedy is that he has no sense of his limitations. He thinks he is a player. A mover and a shaker. Tory MPs merely look on in embarrassment. Cleverly began as he finished. With waffle. Two years on from the last integrated review, he just wanted to clarify a few things. No one could have predicted that Russia would invade Ukraine. Er … It had literally done just that in 2014 and no one had really batted an eyelid. But no matter. Then Cleverly moved on to the details. Such as they were. We would be increasing the defence budget by £5bn. Though as £3bn was already promised to the nuclear programme and £1.9bn to replacing our diminishing weapons stockpile, that would leave the armed forces fighting over the remaining £100m. Labour had no real issues with any of this – David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, may not be so incoherent as Cleverly but he also loves the sound of his own voice and so he took an age to say next to nothing. The deputy speaker was even desperately trying to get him to shut up. Most of the criticism came from the Tory ranks. Some were upset China had not been named as more of a military threat to the UK. The language had been beefed up a little, they argued, but not enough. We were just asking for trouble by not taking China seriously. Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the select defence committee, won’t be happy until the UK spends every penny it has on defence. Cleverly merely observed that Ben Wallace had had plenty of time to moan about his budget during the defence questions that had taken place earlier. And because he’d said nothing then he must be happy. Besides which, the government was definitely going to increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2025. There again, he was also under the impression that the Tories would still be in power then. Maybe he knows something we don’t. Actually, scrub that ..."

                    "headline": "‘Danger, disorder and division’: defence review refresh sees a more hostile world",
                    "bodyText": "Britain’s refresh of its defence and foreign policy may mark the moment when the UK sobers up about its place in a world that it now describes as “defined by danger, disorder and division”, and increasingly tilting to authoritarianism. Gone is the optimistic Global Britain bombast of the Boris Johnson era, set out in the original integrated review only two years ago. That version championed the UK as “a beacon of democratic sovereignty” and one of the most influential countries in the world, and hailed its ability to draw on its post-Brexit status to “do things differently, economically and politically”. By contrast, the reworked review is a vision of a colder, darker and more hostile world where the interests of the west do not necessarily triumph. There is no shortage of patriotism, but warnings and forebodings fill every page: “What has changed is that our collective security now is intrinsically linked to the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine.” “The transition into a multipolar, fragmented and contested world has happened more quickly and definitively than anticipated. We are now in a period of heightened risk and volatility that is likely to last beyond the 2030s.” “A growing convergence of authoritarian states are challenging the basic conditions for an open, stable and peaceful international order, working together to undermine the international system or remake it in their image.” But the scale of these intensifying threats has only led to a modest increase in defence spending of £5bn over two years, mainly related to the Aukus nuclear submarine deal. There has been, however, a re-evaluation of the importance of alliances and partnerships to the UK. The emphasis now is less on the benefits of Britain going it alone, and more on the necessity for democracies to “out cooperate” the autocracies. Rishi Sunak’s visit to the US to mark the next stage of Aukus symbolises the importance of alliances. Yet the passages in the refreshed review on Europe are also striking. Where the Johnson review made some grudging references to future bilateral relations with Germany, France and Italy, Sunak’s version says: “Our ambition is to build even stronger relationships with our European allies and partners based on values, reciprocity and cooperation across our shared interests. This includes the EU, with which we seek to work closely in areas of mutual benefit, as we have done in response to Ukraine.” Indeed the effect of Russia’s invasion has been to make UK ties in Europe stronger than for decades, it says. The paper promises new forms of cooperation on issues of shared interest. It does not go as far as Labour’s call for a security pact with Europe, but it amounts to a course correction. The domestic practical proposals, including taking spending on defence to 2.25% of GDP, fill gaps or correct errors. There is an acknowledgment of soft power, for instance giving the BBC World Service £20m to avoid cuts to the BBC Arabic service. On the principle of know your enemy – the philosophy enunciated by Sir Percy Cradock, Margaret Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser – more diplomats will be employed that can interpret China. The importance of sanctions to modern foreign policy is accepted through a sanctions enforcement and evasion body. The conflict, security and stability fund, aimed at fragile states, is buried, replaced by a body with a greater domestic security agenda. An M15 one-stop shop called the National Protective Security Authority will advise businesses of the risks of autocracies entering their supply chain. Many of these policies look to have the imprimatur of the foreign affairs select committee whose previous chair, Tom Tugendhat, is now security minister. There is also an implicit, but not explicit, admission that the merger of the international development department and the Foreign Office is a problem with measures including a new governance structure to improve oversight of all aid spending. However, if the 2023 refreshed review is clear about the threat posed by the autocrats, it is less clear on how to reduce their growing appeal. The 2021 review more than once said Britain would be a force for good in the world by putting human rights at its heart of its appeal. But the 2023 version says: “Today’s international system cannot simply be reduced to ‘democracy versus autocracy’, or divided into binary, cold war-style blocs.” It explains “an expanding group of ‘middle-ground powers’ are of growing importance to UK interests as well as global affairs more generally, and do not want to be drawn into zero-sum competition any more than the UK does”. The UK, it concludes, needs to work with these countries to protect a shared interest in an open and stable international order, but accepts that we may not share all of the same values and national interests. This is as much about stability as democracy. This ambiguity about values is reflected in the UK approach to China. Yes, the review addresses the threat to Taiwan for the first time, but overall it is reluctant to get off the fence. The refresh treats China as a trading partner and potential partner to slow climate change, on the one hand, at the same time warning it is “an epoch-defining challenge to the UK type of international order, both in terms of security and values”. That will disappoint many MPs. Alicia Kearns, the current chair of the foreign affairs select committee, reflected that frustration, arguing the challenge from China is not just a threat to an economic order but to the whole values system of the west. But with the Ukraine issue and its fallout so urgent, perhaps this is a conclusion the government dare not yet fully embrace."

                    "bodyText": "Labour accused the government of failing to reverse cuts in armed forces as the government unveiled a £5bn increase in defence spending over the next two years to bolster ammunition supplies and investment in new nuclear submarines as part of its Integrated Review Refresh. The opposition highlighted that no money had been found to reverse a reduction of 10,000 service people in the size of the army, replace Hercules planes used to rescue desperate people from Kabul or increase the number of modernised British tanks to replace those sent to Ukraine. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, told MPs that he believed the government’s renewed defence and foreign policy statement, recast after the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the start of the war in Ukraine, was incomplete. “It does not answer growing questions concerning capability gaps that weaken our national defences and undermine the UK’s Nato contribution,” Lammy said, arguing that the government’s long term pledge to lift defence spending from 2.1% to 2.5% of GDP was not credible. The Labour MP accused the government of making “another hollow promise” because there was “no plan, no timetable” to underline the spending commitment, which would imply an extra £10bn to £13bn real terms increase in military budgets. Overnight, Downing Street had announced the key points of the refreshed Integrated Review, a revision of defence and foreign policy first announced by Boris Johnson as prime minister in 2021. But the extra £5bn was less than the £8bn to £11bn that Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, had sought. Rishi Sunak, visiting San Diego, where he was poised to announce a deal to design and build new nuclear-powered submarines with Australia and the US, told the BBC that the latest review was a response to the fact that “the world has become more volatile, the threats to our security have increased”. The prime minister said the review, and the extra £5bn promised, was part of a “record amount of investments since the end of the cold war” including a previously announced £16.5bn in 2020. Lifting defence spending to 2.5% of GDP was “an ambition over time” he added. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, presenting the full review to the Commons, said that Lammy’s remarks represented a dramatic change of position for Labour when compared to the party’s previous leader Jeremy Corbyn. Cleverly said he was “very glad to hear Labour frontbench support for the nuclear deterrent and Nato”. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the defence select committee, also called for rearmament in response to Russian aggression and the rise of China. “We are sliding towards a new cold war. Threats are increasing but here we are staying on a peacetime budget,” he said, calling for a rapid move to 2.5% of GDP. There also remains frustration in military circles that more was not done to reverse decades of cuts to the army. Of the extra £5bn, £3bn is pledged to help fund the joint Aukus nuclear-powered submarines, not expected until the early 2040s and nearly £2bn to replenish stockpiles of munitions sent to Ukraine. Ed Arnold, a land warfare analyst with the Rusi thinktank and a former infantry officer, said the UK was increasingly unable to meet its commitments to Nato, with its promise to provide a war-fighting division in an emergency. “Nato’s defence planning process heavily favours land forces and what the military alliance wants from the UK is a heavy division. At the moment that won’t be ready until 2030. Already the UK has had to pull out a battle group from Estonia because it couldn’t be sustained,” Arnold said. Several European countries have promised to lift defence spending in response to the Russian invasion. Germany expected to announce a €10bn increase for 2024 while Poland plans to increase its military budget to above 4% of GDP this year. As expected, the published document also sought to calibrate a careful line on China, describing the country as posing “an epoch-defining and systemic challenge” with implications for all of the UK. But it fell short of describing Beijing as a threat, a demand made by many backbench Conservative MPs."

Then, around a decade later, we hope to deliver the very first nuclear-powered sub built on home soil. It’s being described as a “new dawn” for defence policy and the journey is under way as Anthony Albanese meets Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak in San Diego. We’ve got full coverage of the announcement, and the reaction to this huge, expensive and globally consequential deal. Back home, Indigenous leaders have voiced some sharp criticisms of opponents of the voice to parliament. And bank shares could come under pressure as the fallout from the biggest financial collapse since 2008 continues. Australia ‘White saviours’ | Conservatives raising doubts about the voice to parliament have been accused of deliberately finding flaws with the proposal “just to stay in the spotlight”, according to a member of the government’s advisory group (pictured). Another group member, Prof Marcia Langton, called it a “relentless scare campaign”. Aukus pact | Australian taxpayers will be on the hook for billions of dollars as the prime minister prepares to announce the new Aukus submarine deal with the US and UK in San Diego this morning. It will mean a “substantial” spending commitment over decades – Peter Dutton thinks it should come from NDIS cuts – and will also involve more “rotational” visits to Australia by US and UK submarines. The UK is itself getting Aukus subs, which should hit the water by the end of the 2030s. Here’s an explainer on all you need to know. Emissions push | Independent MPs Allegra Spender and Zali Steggall are pushing the government to include an absolute cap or an explicit objective that emissions must come down under the safeguard mechanism. Plastic plan | Thousands of tonnes of soft plastic that was collected and dropped off by supermarket customers and has been stockpiled since the collapse of a domestic recycling program could be be shipped to the US for processing. ‘It’s over’ | Conservationists are confident that a five-year hunt for the remaining feral fox in the Pilliga Scrub area of New South Wales – nicknamed Rambo – has ended in its death, paving the way for the greater bilby to flourish again. World China ‘irreversible’ | Xi Jinping has placed the issue of Taiwan at the centre of his third term in office and appeared to be asserting China’s “irreversible” role on the global stage in a speech in Beijing. Ukraine struggle | Amid reports that Xi will start cementing that role with a visit to Russia as early as next week, Kremlin forces are still locked in a brutal struggle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Paper problem | All toilet paper from across the globe checked for toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” contained the compounds, with the waste probably creating a significant source of water pollution, according to research. Attenborough warning | Sir David Attenborough has warned that “nature is in crisis” and is being destroyed at a “terrifying rate”, but said the world had the solutions to solve the problem. ‘Surreal few days’ | Football fans in England can breathe a sigh of relief after the BBC and Gary Lineker agreed that the star presenter would return to present Match of the Day following his suspension for an anti-government tweet. But the row could still see Tory-supporting BBC chair Richard Sharp forced to quit. Full Story Israel, the West Bank and a week of rampage Escalating violence by Israeli settlers in the occupied Palestinian territories is happening amid unprecedented anti-government protests. It’s no coincidence, reports Bethan McKernan. In-depth Australian banking shares are likely to come under pressure today as financial stocks in the US and Europe fell sharply again in the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which has now been bought by HSBC for £1. Interest rates could stop rising sooner than thought because of the crisis, economists have said, with the US Fed already believed to be considering moderating its next expected hike to protect the markets. Here’s an explainer to help understand what’s going on, while our US columnist Robert Reich thinks deregulation is to blame. Not the news He has been described as “one of the greatest brains in the history of Australian sports administration”. But as he goes into his final quarter as boss of the AFL, Gillon McLachlan faces one of the game’s biggest ever threats as the complainants in the Hawthorn racism demand a reckoning. As Jonathan Horn observes wryly, with two days before the season’s first bounce, the suave McLachlan probably didn’t have “undertaking decolonisation” on his final to-do list. The world of sport Cricket | Australia have lost four Test series in a row against India after the fourth Test in Ahmedabad was drawn. They have an early chance for revenge in the world championship final in England in June, and their tenacity in India might prove decisive. Baseball | Australia have made history by reaching the World Baseball Classic quarter-finals for the first time after beating the Czech Republic in Tokyo. Ashes | David Saker, the renowned fast bowling coach, has agreed to work for England in this year’s Ashes series.

                    "bodyText": "Australia is to embark on one of its most significant, expensive and geopolitically consequential military tasks in a century: the push to acquire, operate – and eventually build – nuclear-powered submarines. The program is forecast to cost $268bn to $368bn between now and the mid 2050s, most of it beyond the first four-year budget period, and will depend on help from the US and the UK. As part of the multidecade nuclear-powered submarine plan unveiled on Tuesday, Australian taxpayers will pour “substantial” funds into expanding American shipbuilding capacity, understood to be about $3bn in the first four years. Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said Aukus plan marked “a new chapter” in the relationship between the three countries, as he joined the US president, Joe Biden, and the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, for the announcement in San Diego. “The Aukus agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment in Australia’s defence capability in our history,” Albanese said. Without directly naming China as a source of concern, Albanese said the plan reflected a shared determination to ensure all countries could “act in their sovereign interests free from coercion”. He said his government was “also determined to promote security by investing in our relationships across our region”. In a bid to reassure partners across the Indo-Pacific, Biden said it was important to note the Australian submarines would be nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed. “I want to be clear from the outset – right off the bat – so there’s no confusion or misunderstanding on this critical point,” Biden said. “Australia is a proud non-nuclear weapons state, and it’s committed to stay that way.” Australia would invite “rotational forces” of US and UK submarines to visit the country from 2027. The first Australian-built nuclear-powered submarines, fitted with vertical launch systems to fire cruise missiles, are due to enter into service in the early 2040s. The British-designed submarine “will incorporate US technology such as propulsion plant systems and components, a common vertical launch system and weapons”, an Australian government fact sheet said. “The Aukus partners will also develop a joint combat system as an expansion of the US-Australia combat system.” The plan begins with increased visits by US submarines to Australian ports this year. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup From 2027 at the earliest, the UK and the US plan to establish a rotational presence of one UK Astute class submarine and up to four US Virginia class submarines at HMAS Stirling near Perth, Western Australia. This will be called “Submarine Rotational Force-West” (SRF-West). The Australian government argues this rotational presence “will comply fully with Australia’s longstanding position of no foreign bases on its territory” because these submarines will be rotated through the location and will not be permanently based in Australia. The three countries argue the rotational presence will “put our nations shoulder to shoulder as Australia builds the necessary operational capabilities and skills to steward and operate its own fleet of nuclear-powered submarines”. The US and UK submarines would operate as sovereign assets under the command of, respectively, American and British commanders, but there would be “a significant degree of coordination in their activities”, a senior Biden administration official said. Beginning in the early 2030s, the US intends to sell Australia three Virginia class submarines, with the potential to sell up to two more if needed, pending approval from the US Congress. The three governments argue this is “critical to continue growing Australia’s ability to own and operate” a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines and to ensure Australia does not experience any capability gap when its Collins class diesel-electric submarines are retired from the 2030s. The Australian government still plans to extend the life of some of these six conventional submarines, but the Aukus plans means it may not be necessary to carry out expensive upgrades on all of them. The third phase of the program involves the design and construction of a submarine to be known as the “SSN Aukus”, to be based on a UK design but incorporate US technology – as the Guardian foreshadowed last week. “Australia’s long-term submarine will be a state-of-the-art platform that uses the best of US, UK and Australian technologies,” the official said. “SSN Aukus will be built and deployed by both Australia and the UK. The United Kingdom intends to deliver its first SSN Aukus domestically in the late 2030s. Australia intends to deliver the first SSN Aukus built in Australia to the Royal Australian Navy in the early 2040s. “This is going to require significant improvements in industrial bases in all three countries.” Senior Biden administration officials said the budget commitment from Australia towards the US industrial base was “another manifestation of just how serious and critical this effort is”. The $3bn would help the US reduce work backlogs on its own Virginia class submarines, and expand its production ability. The funding for US domestic production could be a point of tension in Australia at a time when the budget is facing pressure on multiple fronts. The projected cost includes includes $9bn over the initial four-year budget period, or an increase of $3bn compared with the $6bn earmarked for the abandoned French project. Defence is being asked to offset that $3bn, which could come through changes to other defence projects. Australian officials believe it is hard to estimate the cost over the life of the program, but have predicted a range based on all costs including acquisition and sustainment. The long-term cost of the submarine plan is likely to be about 0.15% of Australia’s gross domestic product per year on average, compared with Labor’s pre-election overall pledge to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence annually. The Coalition’s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, earlier offered bipartisan support to the overall Aukus deal, saying it is “truly a multigenerational nation-building task for the Australian people” and that it “cannot fail”. Hastie also acknowledged the Aukus project would require some “hard choices” in the budget because “money doesn’t grow on trees”."

Here is a round-up of the day’s stories: Britain declared that the UK’s security hinged on the outcome of the Ukraine war in an update to its foreign policy framework published on Monday. The UK will invest an extra £5bn in the armed forces over two years and increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. Britain’s Royal Navy said it was escorting a Russian frigate and tanker in waters close to the UK having shadowed the vessels through the Channel on Sunday morning. The international criminal court intends to open two war crimes cases tied to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and will seek arrest warrants for several people, the New York Times reported citing sources unauthorised to speak publicly. The cases are the first international charges to be brought forward since the start of the conflict, the newspaper reports. China’s president, Xi Jinping, is planning to visit Russia as soon as next week, people familiar with the matter said, according to Reuters. Xi also plans to speak with Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the first time since the start of the war, according to the Wall Street Journal. China’s president is to speak virtually with his Ukrainian counterpart, probably after a visit to Moscow next week, the paper reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Negotiations began on Monday between UN officials and Russia’s deputy foreign minister on a possible extension to a deal allowing the safe export of grain from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, the Russian diplomatic mission in Geneva said. Moscow does not object to renewing a deal allowing the safe export of grain from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports but only for a period of 60 days, half the term of the previous renewal, Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin has said. The Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a close ally of Vladimir Putin and a staunch supporter of the war in Ukraine, met Russia’s president to discuss the war, according to reports. Russian forces fired two rockets at a school in Avdiivka, according to the head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, Andriy Yermak. One local resident was killed in the attack. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said on Monday that relations between Russia and China were a major factor supporting global stability in the world today, Reuters reports, citing Russian state-owned news agency Tass. The Italian government has said Russian mercenary group Wagner is behind a surge in migrant boats trying to cross the central Mediterranean as part of Moscow’s strategy to retaliate against countries supporting Ukraine, Reuters reported. Yevgeny Prigozhin responded: “We have no idea what’s happening with the migrant crisis, we don’t concern ourselves with it.” A senior Russian lawmaker introduced a bill to parliament on Monday to raise the age of conscription to 21-30 years from the current 18-27 years by 2026, Reuters reported. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has awarded the Hero of Ukraine award to Oleksandr Matsievskyi, a soldier who was seemingly executed by machine gun fire on camera after being captured by Russian soldiers. Zelenskiy said: “Today I conferred the title of Hero of Ukraine upon Oleksandr Matsievskyi, a soldier. A man whom all Ukrainians will know. A man who will be remembered for ever. For his bravery, for his confidence in Ukraine and for his ‘Glory to Ukraine!’” Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has reported on Telegram that one civilian was killed and four people were injured in a rocket attack on Znob-Novhorodske, in Sumy region. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, is reporting a claim that resistance fighters have blown up a railway that Russian forces were using in occupied Kherson. The claims have not been independently verified. A video posted by the Atesh partisan group appears to show a railway track between the settlements of Abrikosivka and Radensk being blown up. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, has reported that a 40-year-old man was injured by a petal mine near Izyium. Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency is reporting that the Russia-installed authorities in occupied regions of Donetsk are claiming that almost 4,500 people have died as a result of shelling by Ukrainian armed forces since 17 February 2022. One of Vladimir Putin’s top allies, the Russian security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev, said on Monday that he doubted that the Nord Stream pipelines were blown up by a pro-Ukrainian group, and said Moscow still did not know who exactly was behind it. Russia’s industry ministry said on Monday it was expanding its list of brands that can be imported without the trademark owner’s permission to include goods from companies such as Ikea and the US toy manufacturers Hasbro and Mattel. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow has offered congratulations to Pope Francis on the 10th anniversary of the latter’s election. Relations between the pope and the patriarch have been strained since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The patriarch has been a vocal supporter of Russia’s military action, whereas Pope Francis has frequently called for peace during his regular Vatican addresses. That’s it from me, Geneva Abdul, and the Ukraine live blog for today. Thanks for following along. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from Ukraine: Rishi Sunak has said the UK will invest an extra £5bn in the armed forces over two years and increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. “It’s clear that the world has become more volatile. The threats to our security have increased,” Sunak told reporters in an interview beside the USS Midway museum ship as he arrived in San Diego to meet Joe Biden and Anthony Albanese to agree on the next steps in a landmark defence agreement, Aukus, with the US and Australia Growing foothold: how Russia donates fertiliser to deepen African alliances Malawi is at the centre of a diplomatic tussle for influence, but as a food crisis looms, farmers are happy to accept desperately needed shipments The Russian national anthem rings out at a farm to the south of Malawi’s capital, Lilongwe. Farmers attending the handover ceremony of 20,000 tonnes of Russian fertiliser rise to their feet, out of respect for their guests. Later, some will collect bags of the desperately needed nitrogen, phosphate and potassium (NPK). Amid global fertiliser shortages and rising prices since 2020, aggravated by the Russia-Ukraine war, the Russian chemicals company Uralchem-Uralkali last year agreed to donate 260,000 tonnes of fertiliser to African countries most at risk of food insecurity. The first shipment, to Malawi, facilitated by the UN World Food Programme (WFP), was signed off in November to urgently avert a looming hunger crisis in the land-locked country. But despite food and fertiliser being exempt from international sanctions placed on Russia, one of the world’s largest fertiliser producers, diplomatic tensions have restricted flow, leaving thousands of tonnes sitting on ships in European docks. The Malawi shipment, having eventually received clearance to leave a port in the Netherlands, faced further delays when it arrived in Mozambique in early January before making its way to Lilongwe on trucks. It finally arrived in Malawi in February.

Biden’s request earmarks $842 billion for the Pentagon with an additional $44 billion earmarked for defence-related programs at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Energy and other agencies, bringing the national security budget to $886 billion, up from $858 billion enacted last year, according to Reuters. Britain’s Royal Navy said on Monday that it was escorting a Russian frigate and tanker in waters close to the UK having shadowed the vessels through the Channel on Sunday morning. The Royal Navy said in a statement: The Royal Navy routinely responds to escort warships in our territorial waters and the adjacent sea areas to ensure compliance with maritime law and to deter malign activity. Escorting the Russian task group alongside allied partners demonstrates the commitment of the Royal Navy and the NATO alliance to maintaining maritime security which is crucial to our national interests.” Here are the latest images from photographer Alessio Mamo in Krasnopillia, Ukraine: Moscow does not object to renewing a deal allowing the safe export of grain from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports but only for a period of 60 days, half the term of the previous renewal, Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin has said. Vershinin was speaking after holding talks with U.N. officials in Geneva, Reuters reports. The Black Sea grain initiative, brokered between Russia and Ukraine by the United Nations and Turkey last July, aimed to prevent a global food crisis by allowing Ukrainian grain blockaded by Russia’s invasion to be safely exported from three Ukrainian ports. The deal, which was extended for 120 days in November, is up for renewal on March 18. Vershinin said: [Russia] does not object to another extension of the ‘Black Sea Initiative’ after its second term expiration on March 18, but only for 60 days…Our further stance will be determined upon tangible progress on normalization of our agricultural exports, not in words, but in deeds. Dozens of Ukrainian soldiers on Monday wrapped up a four-week training in Spain on how to operate the Leopard 2A4 battle tank, of which Madrid is set to deliver six mothballed units to Kyiv this spring. A total of 40 tank crew members and 15 mechanical specialists underwent training on their use at a military base in the northeastern city of Zaragoza, Spain’s armed forces said in a statement. “It has been intense,” Spanish trainer Captain Contreras - who identified himself only by his rank and surname - told reporters, who were allowed access to the drills for the first time. Contreras said the Ukrainians would be returning home “with a very acceptable knowledge” of the Leopards. “Although the tanks were different, there were many systems that coincide and that has made things much easier. With that, together with the motivation that the personnel brought and their desire to learn, we see them very well prepared to resume combat.” One of the Ukrainian soldiers being trained had a patch on a sleeve sporting the slogan “Freedom or Death” underneath the Ukrainian flag. The Italian government has said Russian mercenary group Wagner is behind a surge in migrant boats trying to cross the central Mediterranean as part of Moscow’s strategy to retaliate against countries supporting Ukraine, Reuters reports. In a statement, defence minister Guido Crosetto said: I think it is now safe to say that the exponential increase in the migratory phenomenon departing from African shores is also, to a not insignificant extent, part of a clear strategy of hybrid warfare that the Wagner division is implementing, using its considerable weight in some African countries. Some 20,000 people have reached Italy so far this year, compared to 6,100 in the same period of 2022, interior ministry figures show, and the migration issue is piling pressure on the rightist government. In an expletive-laden voice message posted on his Telegram channel, Wagners boss Yevgeny Prigozhin responded: We have no idea what’s happening with the migrant crisis, we don’t concern ourselves with it. He then used a series of obscenities to describe Crosetto and urged him to pay attention to his own country. Britain cast China as representing an “epoch-defining challenge” to the world order, in an update to its foreign policy framework published on Monday which declared that the UK’s security hinged on the outcome of the Ukraine war. In the refresh of Britain’s blueprint for security and international policy, the government warned of China’s deepening partnership with Russia, and Moscow’s growing cooperation with Iran following the invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. Only first released two years ago, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Britain’s Integrated Review (IR) had been updated to take account of events, with the hardening of language and positioning towards Beijing and Moscow. But the decision to still not describe China as a threat was likely to disappoint many in Sunak’s governing Conservative Party, who also believe his vow to spend an extra 5 billion pounds ($6 billion) on defence is insufficient to support Ukraine without leaving Britain vulnerable. In a foreword to the IR, Sunak wrote: What could not be fully foreseen in 2021 was the pace of the geopolitical change and the extent of its impact on the UK and our people…Since then, Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, weaponisation of energy and food supplies and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, combined with China’s more aggressive stance in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, are threatening to create a world defined by danger, disorder and division. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from Ukraine: The prosecutor at the international criminal court will formally open two war crimes cases and issue arrest warrants for several Russians deemed responsible for the mass abduction of Ukrainian children and the targeting of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, according to reports on Monday. The New York Times and Reuters news agency reported that the prosecutor, Karim Khan, will ask pre-trial judges to approve arrest warrants on the basis of evidence collected so far. If successful, it would mark the first time ICC warrants had been issued in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is not clear if the warrants would be sealed, which would leave suspects guessing over whether they had been implicated. It is unlikely that the warrants would lead to trials as the ICC would not try the defendants in absentia, and Russia, which is not a member of the ICC, is highly unlikely to hand them over to the court, based in The Hague. Reports of imminent arrest warrants come just over a year after Khan opened an investigation into possible war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in Ukraine. Over the past 12 months, he has made three trips to Ukraine and visited sites of alleged war crimes.

Russia ratcheted up its efforts to take Bakhmut in early February after months of intense fighting around the town, and has since inched into the small city’s suburbs. Ukraine’s forces are now fighting off attacks from the north, east, and south. Their only road out, to the west, is under Russian artillery fire. Ukraine insists there is a strategy behind continuing the fight for Bakhmut. The head of Ukraine’s ground forces, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Sunday that it was using the defence of Bakhmut to buy time until Ukraine is able to carry out an anticipated spring offensive. Syrskyi also said that Ukraine was using the opportunity to kill as many Russian troops as possible and wear down its reserves. “It is necessary to buy time to build reserves and launch a counteroffensive, which is not far off,” Syrskiy said in a statement. “[Ukrainian soldiers are] inflicting the heaviest possible losses, sparing neither themselves nor the enemy.” Read more here: Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said on Monday that relations between Russia and China were a major factor supporting global stability in the world today, Reuters reports, citing Russian state-owned news agency Tass. “Bilateral relations between our countries have reached a new, unprecedented level and have become a major factor supporting global stability in the face of increasing geopolitical tensions in the world,” Tass reported Shoigu as saying in a telegram message to Zhang Youxia, vice-chair of China’s central military commission and a close ally of Chinese President Xi Jinping. Moldova does not currently face “imminent military danger” but is subject to “hybrid warfare generated by Russia” in a bid to “overthrow state power”, its defence minister told Agence France-Presse in an interview Monday. Anatolie Nosatîi sat down for an interview with AFP at his office in Chișinău, after the latest in a string of anti-government protests erupted over the weekend in the small ex-Soviet nation. “Imminent military danger against Moldova currently doesn’t exist, but there are other types of dangers that affect the country’s security – hybrid warfare,” Nosatîi told AFP. By generating “disinformation, tensions inside our society”, Russia was attempting to “change the political order, destabilise and overthrow state power,” the 50-year-old minister said. On Sunday, Moldovan police arrested members of a network seeking to undermine the country they suspected of being orchestrated by Moscow. Joe Biden’s White House in the US accused Russia on Friday of seeking to destabilise Moldova in order to install a pro-Russian government. Pro-European Moldova has repeatedly accused Moscow of plotting to violently topple its government through saboteurs disguised as anti-government protesters, claims which Russia denied. It’s 4pm in Kyiv.

The police said 15 cities and towns, including Bakhmut, Kostyantynivka, and Avdiivka, had come under attack. ‘I hope I haven’t killed anybody’: the pacifist author fighting on Ukraine’s frontline Vlad Beliavsky hoped to bring some peace to the world with his first book, The Pyramid Mind. If we all trained our minds properly, he thought, we could live together in harmony. At best, he imagined his book might even stop wars. Today, he is in Kyiv, wearing military uniform and silhouetted against a neutral background. It is safer not to give details of where; he simply says he is in a military building. As his book is published, 13 years after it was conceived, Lt Beliavsky is marking a year spent fighting for the future of Ukraine. He is a handsome, youthful 33-year-old. In other circumstances you could imagine him in a boyband or becoming the Brian Cox of psychology. But look closely and there are heavy bags beneath his eyes. His skin is pallid. He talks slowly, measuring his words with scrupulous care. At times, he seems on the verge of tears. Read more here: A dispatch from the Guardian correspondent Lorenzo Tondo reporting from Nizhyn, northern Ukraine. Last week, I visited the grave of Oleksandr Igorevich Matsievskyi, a prisoner of war whose murder by Russian soldiers was captured in a grim clip that spread quickly across Ukraine and much of the world. In the graphic 12-second video, Matsievskyi, unarmed, is derided by his captors, who are recording the scene. He calmly puffs on his cigarette, looks his tormentors in the face and says “glory to Ukraine”. Within an instant, multiple shots can be heard and Matsievskyi slumps dead to the ground. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday awarded him a Hero of Ukraine award, bringing an end to a dispute over his identity. Until yesterday, two families, two battalions and two different home towns had each to varying degrees claimed the man as their own, as the identity of the prisoner had not been immediately established due to the low quality of the video. Military authorities launched an investigation to resolve the dispute and were considering exhuming the body of Matsievskyi – who was buried in his home town of Nizhyn, north-east of Kyiv. At stake was not just a posthumous medal for valour, but the pride of claiming a figure to whom mayors and cities across Ukraine are already preparing to dedicate monuments and streets. The final verdict arrived yesterday after an investigation by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), which included communication with the family of the deceased, as well as the processing of photos and video material. None of this will bring Matsievskyi back to life, but it will write his name into Ukrainian history, alongside the border guard on Snake Island who famously declared in the face of the enemy: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.” But even before the military authorities resolved the dispute over his identity, after the military had initially – mistakenly - identified the prisoner with the name of another soldier, dozens of visitors had already gathered to bring flowers to Matsievskyi’s grave. I remember a young man lighting a cigarette and placing it on the edge of the tombstone as if to share a final smoke with Matsievskyi. One year after the war began, the Ukrainian resistance still needs heroes and examples of soldiers to boost the morale of its troops grappling with the bloody and uncertain battle of Bakhmut. There is one detail of Matsievskyi’s story that struck me. His brigade comrades who spoke to the soldier’s mother said the last conversation between them was on 29 December when he prophetically told her: “Mum, I will never surrender.” The international criminal court plans to open two war crimes cases tied to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and will seek arrest warrants for several people, the New York Times reported citing sources unauthorised to speak publicly. The cases are the first international charges to be brought forward since the start of the conflict, the newspaper reports. The charges allege Russia deliberately targeted civilian infrastructure and abducted Ukrainian children and teenagers and sent them to Russian re-education camps. The chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, a senior English barrister, must first present his charges to a panel of pretrial judges, who will decide whether the legal standards have been met for issuing arrest warrants, or whether investigators need more evidence. It was not clear whom the court planned to charge in each case. The news comes days after the Pentagon was accused of blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC) about Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The Biden White House and state department have been a proponent of cooperation with the Hague-based ICC, as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes, but the defence department is firmly opposed on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from Ukraine and elsewhere: Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, a close ally of Vladimir Putin and a staunch supporter of the war in Ukraine, met with Russia’s president to discuss the war, according to reports. In a video circulating online shared by BBC journalist Francis Scarr, Kadyrov is seen sitting across from Putin reading from prepared notes. “In our republic everything is very good,” said Kadyrov. “That’s thanks to you, don.” The UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, will unveil his budget on Wednesday as the country faces the pressing issues of inflation, pay and public finances. Here’s what PA Media says we can expect in the budget this week: The Treasury has been under pressure for months to boost the defence budget, as the war in Ukraine continues. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has promised an extra £5bn for the military over two years, with an extra £1.98bn this year and £2.97bn next year for defence. According to Sunak, the extra funding will take spending from 2% of GDP in 2020 to 2.25% in 2025. Any indications from the chancellor about the future trajectory of defence spending beyond this will likely be eagerly received by MPs. Negotiations began on Monday between UN officials and Russia’s deputy foreign minister on a possible extension to a deal allowing the safe export of grain from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, the Russian diplomatic mission in Geneva said. The Black Sea grain initiative, brokered between Russia and Ukraine by the UN and Turkey last July, aimed to prevent a global food crisis by allowing Ukrainian grain blockaded by Russia’s invasion to be safely exported from three Ukrainian ports. The deal, which was extended for 120 days in November, is up for renewal on 18 March, Reuters reports. Moscow has already signalled it will only agree to an extension if restrictions affecting its own exports are lifted, but many diplomats and senior officials, including Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, are optimistic that the deal will be renewed. Russian officials say that although the country’s agricultural exports have not been explicitly targeted by the west, sanctions on its payments, logistics and insurance industries have created a barrier for it being able to export its own grains and fertilisers. Russian liberals on Monday celebrated the Oscars win of Navalny, a documentary about the poisoning and imprisonment of “hero” Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The film, which won best feature documentary at the Academy Awards in LA on Sunday, follows an investigation by Navalny’s team together with the Bellingcat group as they unmask FSB agents who were sent to poison Navalny in 2020. The Kremlin has always denied involvement. Director Daniel Rohe accepted his statuette by dedicating it to Navalny and to all political prisoners around the world. “Alexei Navalny, the leader of the Russian opposition, remains in solitary confinement for what he calls – I want to make sure we get his words exactly right –‘Vladimir Putin’s unjust war of aggression in Ukraine’,” Roher said. Read more here: A senior Russian lawmaker introduced a bill to parliament on Monday to raise the age of conscription to 21-30 years from the current 18-27 years by 2026, Reuters reports. The bill was introduced by Andrei Kartapolov, a former general who chairs the State Duma’s defence committee and represents the ruling United Russia bloc, just over a year into Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine. Because there are two transition years - 2024 and 2025 - when the conscription age will span 10 or 11 years instead of the usual nine, the bill would for a time increase the number of men subject to a year’s compulsory service. President Vladimir Putin gave his backing in December to defence ministry proposals to push back the age range. In January, Ukraine’s military intelligence claimed that Russia is set to order the mobilisation of as many as 500,000 conscripts in January in addition to the 300,000 it called up in October, in another apparent sign that Vladimir Putin has no intention of ending the war. Xi Jinping also plans to speak with Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the first time since the start of the war, according to the Wall Street Journal. China’s president is to speak virtually with his Ukrainian counterpart likely following a visit to Moscow next week the paper reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from Ukraine: China’s president, Xi Jinping, is planning to visit Russia as soon as next week, people familiar with the matter said, according to Reuters, while Moscow and Kyiv both reported intense fighting over the eastern city of Bakhmut. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has awarded the Hero of Ukraine to Oleksandr Matsievskyi, a soldier who was seemingly executed by machine gun fire on camera after being captured by Russian soldiers. Zelenskiy said: “Today I conferred the title of Hero of Ukraine upon Oleksandr Matsievskyi, a soldier. A man whom all Ukrainians will know. A man who will be remembered for ever. For his bravery, for his confidence in Ukraine and for his ‘Glory to Ukraine!’” Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has reported on Telegram that one civilian was killed and four people were injured in a rocket attack on Znob-Novhorodske in Sumy region. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, is reporting a claim that resistance fighters have blown up a railway that Russian forces were using in occupied Kherson. The claims have not been independently verified. A video posted by the Atesh partisan group appears to show a railway track between the settlements of Abrikosivka and Radensk being blown up. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has reported that a 40-year-old man has been injured by a petal mine near Izyium. Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency is reporting that the Russia-installed authorities in occupied regions of Donetsk are claiming that almost 4,500 people have died as a result of shelling by Ukrainian armed forces since 17 February 2022. One of President Vladimir Putin’s top allies – Russian security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev – said on Monday that he doubts that the Nord Stream pipelines were blown up by a pro-Ukrainian group, and said that Moscow still does not know who exactly was behind it. Russia’s industry ministry said on Monday it was expanding its list of brands that can be imported without the trademark owner’s permission to include goods from companies such as Ikea and US toy manufacturers Hasbro and Mattel. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow has offered congratulations to Pope Francis on the 10th anniversary of the latter’s election. Relations between the pope and the patriarch have been strained since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The patriarch has been a vocal supporter of Russia’s military action, whereas Pope Francis has frequently called for peace during his regular Vatican addresses. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Geneva Abdul will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has reported on Telegram that one civilian was killed and four people were injured in a rocket attack on Znob-Novhorodske in Sumy region. The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, is reporting a claim that resistance fighters have blown up a railway that Russian forces were using in occupied Kherson. It writes: On the left bank of the Kherson region, members of the resistance movement blew up the railway on which the echelons of the Russian army were moving. “The army of the Russian Federation understands that they are also uneasy on the Crimean peninsula. We keep their logistical transport routes under control, including with the support of the resistance movement,” the head of the joint press centre of the defence and security forces of the South, said on air. The claims have not been independently verified. Kherson is one of the regions of Ukraine which Russia partially occupies and which it claimed to annex in October last year. Ukrainian forces liberated the city of Kherson from occupation after Russian forces pulled back to the south of the Dnieper River. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has again warned residents of the danger of mines in the region. He has posted to Telegram: In a village a 40-year-old civilian man stepped on a “Petal” mine near a field. As a result of the explosion, he received shrapnel wounds and an injury. [He was] hospitalised in moderate condition. Once again, I urge everyone to be as attentive and careful as possible, because the enemy left a lot of mines and other explosive objects in the de-occupied territories. Refrain from visiting forests, forest strips, rivers, fields, etc. All of these areas are potentially dangerous. Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency is reporting that the Russia-installed authorities in occupied regions of Donetsk are claiming that almost 4,500 people have died as a result of shelling by Ukrainian armed forces since 17 February 2022. The claims have not been independently verified. It quotes the “joint centre for control and coordination of issues related to war crimes of Ukraine”, saying: During the 389 days of escalation, 677 civilians, including 28 children, were killed in the territory within the borders before the start of the special military operation. In the territory liberated during the special military operation, 3,780 civilians were killed, including 106 children. In total, 4,457 [people], including 134 [children]. “Special military operation” has been Russia’s preferred term for the invasion of Ukraine which it launched on 24 February 2022. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) was founded in 2014, and has been recognised as a legitimate authority by only three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. Russia’s state-owned RIA news agency has reported that Patriarch Kirill of Moscow has offered congratulations to Pope Francis on 10th anniversary of the latter’s election. It quotes Kirill saying “during the difficult times we are experiencing, dialogue between religious leaders can bring good results”. Relations between the pope and the patriarch have been strained since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The patriarch has been a vocal supporter of Russia’s military action, whereas Pope Francis has frequently called for peace during his regular Vatican addresses. Russia’s industry ministry said on Monday it was expanding its list of brands that can be imported without the trademark owner’s permission to include goods from companies such as Ikea and US toy manufacturers Hasbro and Mattel. Reuters reports Moscow has been pushing a so-called “parallel imports” scheme to help domestic consumers maintain access to a host of foreign products in the face of sanctions imposed by the west over the conflict in Ukraine. The mechanism allows Russian companies to buy goods from any company outside Russia, including from the country of the goods’ origin, provided they were bought legally. The Ministry of Industry and Trade’s expanded list includes luxury brands, such as Lancome, Giorgio Armani and Yves Saint Laurent, and brands including Wahl, Zanussi, and Nintendo. Brands of motor oils and agricultural equipment makers were also added. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from Ukraine, showing damage to buildings in Kharkiv. One of President Vladimir Putin’s top allies said on Monday that he doubts that the Nord Stream pipelines were blown up by a pro-Ukrainian group, and said that Moscow still does not know who exactly was behind it, Reuters reports, citing Interfax. Russian security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev also said that Ukraine had gained nothing from the destruction of the pipelines. Reuters has a quick snap to say that sources have told the news agency that China’s Xi Jinping, recently handed an unprecedented third term in office, plans to visit Moscow as soon as next week. It would send a strong signal that China was doubling down on its relationship with Russia at a time when some elements in the west have been expressing concern that China might start to supply arms to aid Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, is reporting that according to the local authority, the settlement of Shalyhyne in Sumy oblast, close to the border with Russia, has been shelled this morning. Ukraine became the third biggest importer of arms in 2022, according to the latest report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. According to the analysis, Ukraine was the 14th biggest importer in 2018-2022, with the top five at the time including India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Australia and China. As of 2022 it had become the third, next to Qatar and India. Alone Ukraine accounted for 2% of global arms imports in the five year period between 2018 and 2022. At the same time Russia’s arms exports fell as weapons and equipment was diverted to support its invasion of Ukraine. Pieter D Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI arms transfers programme, said many of the weapons systems western countries have been reluctant to sell Ukraine were being sold elsewhere. Due to concerns about how the supply of combat aircraft and long-range missiles could further escalate the war in Ukraine, Nato states declined Ukraine’s requests for them in 2022. At the same time, they supplied such arms to other states involved in conflict, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia. For more on this story, read the full report by Daniel Boffey. President Volodomyr Zelenskiy has awarded the Hero of Ukraine to Oleksandr Matsievskyi, a soldier who was apparently shown being executed by machine gun fire on camera after being captured by Russian soldiers. In his late night address on Sunday, Zelenskiy Zelenskiy said Matsievskyi will be “remembered forever”. Today I conferred the title of Hero of Ukraine upon Oleksandr Matsievskyi, a soldier. A man whom all Ukrainians will know. A man who will be remembered for ever. For his bravery, for his confidence in Ukraine and for his ‘Glory to Ukraine!’ For more on this story, read the full report. A documentary film about imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has won at the Oscars. “Navalny”, which follows the poisoning and detention of opposition leader, won best feature documentary overnight. The award was accepted by Yulia Navalnaya, Navalny’s wife and his daughter, Dasha Navalnaya who used the moment to deliver a personal message. My husband is prison just for telling the truth. My husband is in prison just for defending democracy. Alexei, I am dreaming of the day you will be free and our country will be free. Stay strong my love. Speaking to the Associated Press before the ceremony, his daughter said she was attending to bring attention to her father’s imprisonment. It’s crazy. But it’s my life. And I’m fighting for freedom of speech and I’m fighting to get Alexei out – my dad - and I’m fighting for democracy in Russia. Ukrainian forces repelled 102 attacks in the last day according to the latest update from the General staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. In its latest update, it said Russian forces have continued offensive operations in the regions of Lymansky, Bakhmutsky, Avdiivskyi, Marinskyi and Shakhtarskyi directions. It said Russian forces had launched three missile strikes, including on civilian infrastructure in Solvyansk, eight airstrikes and 49 rocket attacks. Around Kupyans and Lymansk, Russian forces have continued attempting to break through Ukrainian defences with assaults in several areas and artillery shelling. The update also claimed Russian forces “continue to plunder temporarily captured territories”. Recently, in Energodar, the occupiers began to remove from the educational and training center of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant educational equipment, which was used to improve the qualifications of personnel. A Russian military blogger claims there is a high desetion rate among Spetsnaz forces. In a report cited by the Institute for Study of War, it was claimed no Septsnaz unit is at its full complement and that some commanders have fled their units despite receiving generous salaries for the past decade. The ISW noted it could not independently confirm these reports and suggested that “it appears unlikely that most commanders have fled these elite units”. Ukrainian forces claim to have killed over a thousand Russian solders in the past few days as they continue to defend the besieged city of Bakhmut. In his evening address on Sunday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said more than a thousand soldiers had been killed and 1,500 wounded in the fighting. In less than a week, starting from the 6th March, we managed to kill more than 1,100 enemy soldiers in the Bakhmut sector alone, Russia’s irreversible loss, right there, near Bakhmut. A shallow river running through the centre of town now marks the frontline in the conflict, according to British intelligence. Information on the frontline is mixed with Ukrainian forces having claim to have repelled Russian attacks across the city . Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin has said the fighting in Bakhmut is “tough, very tough” and claimed “the closer we are to the centre of the city, the harder the fight”. But in one update from a frontline commander on Sunday rejected these claims saying Prigozhin has claimed to have “captured it so many times that no one is interested anymore.” The conflict between Russian Ministry of Defence and Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin has likely reached a climax as thousands of fighters have died fighting in Bakhmut. According to the Institute for Study of War (ISW) analysis, the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) is “currently prioritizing eliminating Wagner on the battlefields in Bakhmut” which it concludes is slowing its advance in the area. It said the conflict began when Prigozhin ran a “relentless defamation” campaign against senior figures in the Russian military, including Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu and Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov. Now that the group has failed to show progress it is believed Russian MoD officials are “seizing the opportunity to deliberately expend both elite and convict Wagner forces in Bakhmut in an effort to weaken Prigozhin and derail his ambitions for greater influence in the Kremlin.” The ISW believes Russian President Vladimir Putin likely became “alarmed” by Prigozhin’s political ambitions in October last year. Putin likely stopped the Russian MoD from directly attacking Prigozhin but instead created conditions in which the Russian military leadership could reassume more authority. Such conditions likely threatened Prigozhin, who began to intensify his criticism of the Russian MoD and further deepened the conflict between Wagner forces and military leadership. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine – this is Royce Kurmelovs bringing you the latest developments. The Institute For The Study of War (ISW) says the tense relationship between the Russian Ministry of Defence and Yevgeny Prigozhin, financier of the Wagner group, has “likely reached its climax” as the battle for Bakhmut unfolds. According to the ISW analysis, senior figures within the Russian Defence ministry are using the battle to churn through Wagner fighters and blunt Prigozhin’s “ambitions for greater influence in the Kremlin”. The analysis comes as the grinding fight over Bakhmut continues with Russian forces failing to advance over the weekend. Both Ukraine and Russia claimed to have killed hundreds of troops on both sides in the fighting. In other developments: Georgian prime minister Irakli Garibashvili has told Ukraine’s political leadership to stay out of Georgian politics. The criticism comes after Ukrainian political leaders expressed their support for protesters in Tbilisi. Garibashvili described the comments as a “direct intervention” in domestic politics and told his Ukrainian counterparts to “take care of yourself and your country, and we will take care of our country”. Belarusian president Aleksandr Lukashenko has arrived in Iran for an official visit to meet local leaders and discuss “trade and economic cooperation”. Russian forces continued offensive operations near Bakhmut but have not completed a turning movement, envelopment, or encirclement around the cit according to the Institute for Study of War. Vyacheslav Gladkov, mayor of the Belgorod oblast in Russia, says the city’s air defence system shot down four missiles. Gladkov said one person had been injured and houses had been damaged by rocket debris. He did not say who he thought had fired the missiles but in the past he has accused Ukrainian forces on the other side of the nearby border of similar attacks. There are reports of partisan attacks on a railway track in Russian-occupied part of Kherson region according to the Ukrainian military’s National Resistance Center. A video posted by the Atesh partisan group appears to show a railway track between the settlements of Abrikosivka and Radensk being blown up. Anton Gerashchenko, a Ukrainian interior ministry adviser, has shared a video on his Telegram channel showing what appears to be an attack on the town of Vuhledar in Donetsk region using incendiary munitions. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a Ukrainian military spokesperson, claimed 221 pro-Moscow troops had been killed and more than 300 wounded in Bakhmut. Russia’s defence ministry said that as many as 210 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the broader Donetsk part of the frontline. Ukraine’s military said it repelled more than 92 Russian assaults in five areas over the past day, according to the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces. The Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said he believed a deal allowing Ukrainian grain to be exported via the Black Sea would be extended from its 18 March deadline. Russia’s foreign ministry said Russian representatives had not yet taken part in negotiations on extending the deal."

                    "bodyText": "Television companies keep a “vault” of shows that were never broadcast due to censorship or concerns about quality. Perhaps the BBC’s archive will now include the pre-production papers for last weekend’s Match of the Day shows, which would have been prepared before Gary Lineker was taken off air and his colleagues refused to appear. Those shows don’t strictly belong in a history of unseen TV as they did go out, more or less (mainly less). The nearest equivalent is the live MotD from 1977 in which the great commentator John Motson, who died last month, got his big chance – a debut FA Cup Final commentary – because David Coleman, the Lineker of his day, had been taken off air in a dispute with BBC Sport over his contract. Some of the most controversial TV shows in history were actually transmitted unaltered. Real Lives (BBC One, 1985), a documentary about Northern Irish rivals Gregory Campbell and Martin McGuinness, was delayed but shown intact after a BBC staff protest. In 1988, ITV’s Death on the Rock overcame attempts at suppression by the Thatcher government to suggest that three IRA members who were shot by the SAS during a Gibraltar mission had been unlawfully killed. But though the shows went out, so did the producers. Alasdair Milne, the BBC director general, was forced out in 1987 by the Tory-appointed chairman, Marmaduke Hussey, due to board concerns including the Real Lives documentary. Thames Television, the company behind Death on the Rock, lost its ITV licence in October 1991, in a bidding process constructed by the Thatcher government. Here is a timeline of shows that were dumped or significantly disrupted. Shows that went on (sort of) Match of the Day/Match of the Day 2 (BBC One/Two, 2023) This weekend’s Match of the Days – much shortened and shorn of the theme tune, commentary, presenter and pundits – have been described as unprecedented. They were certainly striking, but actually sit in a long line of schedule disruption caused by industrial action (of which the walk-out in support of Lineker is the latest example). During previous union disputes, a retired newsreader hosted Breakfast News for one day, while BBC managers falteringly operated cameras. This is never a good look and usually leads to swift restoration of normal broadcasting, as it has in the Lineker case. Sunday Grandstand (BBC Two, 1997) Hosted by Sue Barker, the Sunday edition of the magazine sports show was scheduled to start at noon on 31 August 1997 on BBC Two, including live action from the deciding round of the cricket Sunday League. But following the death of Princess Diana, the BBC screened the same live news service on both its TV channels, judging that any other coverage would be inappropriate. At lunchtime, as viewers realised they were being denied Jonathan Agnew and Geoffrey Boycott reporting on Lancashire v Yorkshire and Kent v Hampshire, copious calls and emails to the BBC led them – neither for the first nor last time overestimating interest in a royal story – to rapidly reinstate sport from 3pm, although Barker was warned to be “solemn and respectful”. It is not yet clear if the make-do MotDs have replaced this as the most complained about BBC sports scheduling. Yesterday’s Men (BBC One, 1971) On his last day in Number 10, after losing the 1970 election to Edward Heath’s Conservatives, the Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, gave an interview to David Dimbleby, then a 32-year-old BBC reporter. Dimbleby had the idea for a documentary about the sudden loss of political power. But Wilson was not told the provocative title, Yesterday’s Men, or that his finances and property purchases would be explored. After the film was previewed, the Labour leader threatened a legal injunction. The BBC eventually showed the film, though it omitted a section in which Dimbleby asked about the money received for his memoirs and the politician demanded that the cameras be stopped. The incident caused long-term problems for the corporation because Wilson turned out to be tomorrow’s man, becoming PM again in 1974. TV Eye: A Bitter Harvest (ITV, 1984) At a time of especially intense rivalry between the BBC and ITV, both current affairs operations urgently worked on stories about the devastating Ethiopian famine. Peter Gill, a film-maker with expertise in international development, made a documentary that was meant to go out ahead of an equivalent BBC film. When an ITV technicians’ strike halted work, unions refused to make an exception even for such subject matter. Eventually, unpaid volunteers were allowed to edit an emergency version, but transmission slipped. The BBC’s film, by Michael Buerk, alerted the world to the crisis, which led to mass charity efforts including Live Aid. Shows that didn’t go on The War Game (1965, BBC) On the first Thursday in September 1965, the BBC director general, Hugh Greene, and chairman, Lord Normanbrook, sat together to watch a drama-documentary about the imagined aftermath of a nuclear attack, made by a 29-year-old production assistant called Peter Watkins. It was highly unusual for the corporation’s top two to preview shows, but they had followed the project from outline stage, given its potential to appal with images of people’s eyeballs melting in an incinerated Britain. Normanbrook, a former cabinet secretary, was officially politically neutral, but behaved, the official history of the BBC notes, “like a government official”, organising a screening for the Home Office and Ministry of Defence, after which the BBC board banned the film. Though it was given limited cinematic screenings from 1966, The War Game was not shown by the BBC until 1985. There is a popular narrative that editorial interference in the BBC is essentially Tory, but that is partly because Conservative governments are more common; it was under the Labour administration of Wilson that The War Game was banned. Brimstone and Treacle (BBC, 1976) In the late 70s, several of BBC One’s Play for Today dramas were dumped due to “sex and violence” (or both), the taboos popularised by morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse. Dennis Potter’s Brimstone and Treacle – in which a stranger who may be Satan rapes a tetraplegic young woman and appears to improve her condition – was written, filmed and scheduled for 6 April 1976. But a worried manager “referred upwards” and Alasdair Milne, then director of programmes (television), who found the play “repugnant”, banned it. After private screenings, both the Guardian and Daily Telegraph acclaimed the play as a complex fable about faith and evil, but the BBC would not resile, and Brimstone and Treacle was not screened until 1987. A film adaptation starring Sting was released in 1982. Scum (BBC, 1977) The Brimstone and Treacle debacle encouraged an “early warning synopsis system”, in which bosses were advised of contentious content. It next led Milne to bin Scum, a play about the brutal borstal system for young offenders, with David Threlfall, Ray Winstone and Phil Daniels in early roles. Scum wasn’t screened by the BBC until 1991, although its writer, Roy Minton, and director, Alan Clarke, remade it as a movie in 1979. Solid Geometry (BBC, 1979) A triple bill of deletions was completed by the “halting of production” on Solid Geometry, Ian McEwan’s adaptation of his short story featuring nude sex scenes and a man whose great-grandfather bought at auction a prodigious penis preserved in formaldehyde. The producer, W Stephen Gilbert, was sacked for speaking to the press, then reinstated but demoted. As McEwan wrote in a preface to the published text, Gilbert “ascended to headlines as TV SEX BOSS (ON CARPET). I sped in taxis to urgent conferences.” These three cancellations occurred under the Labour government of James Callaghan. But it is clear that the killed scripts of this era reflect an apprehension about the impending premiership of Margaret Thatcher, whose first term began two months after Solid Geometry’s cancellation. The legend is that a BBC manager yelled: “Margaret Thatcher is about to become prime minister and you’re trying to make a play with a fucking 12-inch pickled penis in a bottle!” Sin on Saturday (1982, BBC One) Bernard Falk, a perky reporter, sold himself as the host of a “summer replacement” late-Saturday-night studio show, in which one of the seven deadly sins would be discussed each week by studio guests, with an eighth edition debating the modern concept of transgression. Songs and sketches about temptation featured a young comedian called Robbie Coltrane. Editions on lust, covetousness and envy notably failed to rouse those feelings in viewers or reviewers, who saw the show as vulgar and cheap, and, after pushing back envy as close to closedown as possible, the BBC – where Milne was now director general – pulled the plug on gluttony, ending the series five shows short. Secret Society: The Secret Constitution (BBC One, 1986) The government was alarmed to discover that a BBC Scotland series made by the reporter Duncan Campbell included details of a secret satellite surveillance project called Zircon. Thatcher ordered a police raid on BBC Scotland to seize the films. After the dispute contributed to Milne’s removal, the BBC eventually screened the Zircon film in 1988, but an episode about cabinet committees – called The Secret Constitution – remains in a deep BBC vault, 36 years after it was made. Hardwicke House (ITV, 1987) This seven-part sitcom was set in a comprehensive school with a paedophile deputy head and a pupil who was a serial killer. Two episodes ran in February 1987, but viewer, media and political fury about such strong content in a comedy made this another victim of the Thatcherite culture wars. The final five episodes have never been shown. Gerry Adams (BBC, 1988-94) In an attempt to switch off what Thatcher called the “oxygen of publicity”, the British government banned from being broadcast the voices of allegedly pro-terrorist nationalist leaders in Northern Ireland. The BBC got round this by using actors to dub the words of Gerry Adams and others, bringing a usefully lucrative income stream for soundalike actors including Stephen Rea. Shows that went on … digitally Viewpoint (ITV Hub, 2021) Starring Noel Clarke as a surveillance detective, this five-parter was scheduled to fill ITV primetime from Monday to Friday, starting on 26 April 2021. But after the Guardian reported multiple allegations of sexual assault and intimidation against Clarke (which he denied), ITV pulled the fifth episode from the schedules, although made it available on the catch-up service ITV Hub – a pioneering use of having your censorship and cheating it. David Attenborough documentary (BBC iPlayer, 2023) Another use of this “split screen” approach will see Sir David Attenborough’s five-part series Wild Isles supplemented by a documentary about “re-wilding” that will only be available on iPlayer. Some BBC staff have suggested that a “sixth episode” was censored in case it upset rightwing anti-ecologists in government and elsewhere. But the film would irritate them just as much digitally, and the paper trail seems to show that the documentary was made separately and bought by the BBC as extra content for iPlayer, driving audiences there in line with its digital-first policy. • This article was amended on 14 March 2023. The caption of an image embedded in the story said it was Dennis Potter with Sting, “who co-starred in Brimstone and Treacle, in 1976”. Sting was not in the pulled television drama, but starred in the film version, released in 1982. The BBC documentary Real Lives was about Martin McGuinness and Gregory Campbell, not Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams as an earlier version said."

                    "bodyText": "Independent MPs Allegra Spender and Zali Steggall are pushing the government to include an absolute cap or an explicit objective that emissions must come down under the safeguard mechanism. And Spender is publicly insisting Labor has not ruled out a “carbon budget” for big emitters. While the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has designed the scheme to be open to new entrants and has ruled out the Greens request for a ban on new coal and gas, the crossbench, including the balance of power senator David Pocock, wants to ensure industries reduce overall emissions. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Despite modelling by the consultants RepuTex suggesting new projects could cause an emissions “blowout” under the safeguard if they produce more coal or gas than forecast, in a speech to the Sydney Institute on Monday Bowen argued the scheme will deliver 205m tonnes of emissions abatement. Bowen said he understood “the emphasis on possible new facilities in the public debate”, but the safeguard mechanism was “about reducing emissions from all facilities: old and new, industrial and resources-based”. “The fact is this: if our reforms are passed, there will be a scheme to ensure emissions come down from big emitters, whether they be old or new,” he said. “If they don’t pass, there will be no such scheme. It will be business as usual.” In a parliamentary inquiry report last week, Pocock called for the inclusion of “an absolute cap” on emissions to ensure that the government’s goal of no more than 1,233m tonnes of CO2 was released from the facilities covered by the scheme between 2021 and 2030, an amendment that has also been moved by Spender. Spender said the goal was “to make sure the safeguard mechanism actually delivers a reduction in emissions” despite the possibility of new entrants. “I’m in constructive conversations with the minister,” she told Guardian Australia. “My goal is … to truly deliver on decarbonisation. On this one, it’s certainly a conversation we’re having.” Bowen last week told ABC’s 7:30 that “a lot of those proposals [for new entrants] are factored in and we still get 205m tonnes of abatement”. “Secondly, in addition to that, we’ve factored in what we call a reserve, if you like, a buffer of an extra 17m tonnes, in case an existing facility increases production or more new facilities come on,” he said. Steggall said the intent of the bill was good, but the crossbench was concerned about new entrants, the unlimited use of offsets, and improving the measurement of fugitive methane emissions. She has proposed adding an objective for emissions to decline – not a hard cap – accepting that there “may be a reluctance” from the government “to be locked into a scenario that creates difficulties”. “The reality is we do need our gross emissions to go down … If not, we’re on a hiding to nothing if we keep increasing emissions but we offset,” Steggall said. Spender has also proposed abandoning a price cap on carbon offsets, planned to start at $75 a tonne of CO2, as a way to create “sharp incentives” to invest in their own abatements. She urged the government to abandon its approach of “sectoral blindness”, warning that industries in which emissions cuts were difficult, such as cement and aluminium, could become “uncompetitive” if they were forced to shoulder a bigger burden to allow new coal and gas developments. Crossbench parliamentarians have seized on Bowen’s remarks that “new facilities will be obliged to comply with the world’s best practice on emissions” as an indication that higher standards on emissions intensity or limits on offsets could be applied to them. Bowen told the Sydney Institute the safeguard mechanism “incentivises onsite emissions reduction” by giving companies credits for coming in under their emissions ceiling. Bowen said the government’s goal of cutting emissions intensity for most facilities by 4.9% each year was “ambitious” but “achievable”. “Because of that level of ambition, and the breadth and variety of sectors covered, it’s necessary to provide flexibility to industries to ensure that ambition is achievable,” he said."

The Albanese government has indicated it would grant an exemption to allow Coles, Woolworths and Aldi to send the plastic offshore for recycling despite a national waste export ban announced by the Morrison government in 2019. The supermarkets have announced they hope to start a new pilot program collecting soft plastic at some sites before the end of the year, but it would depend on first clearing more than 12,000 tonnes across sites stockpiled in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. With no local recycling facilities available to deal with soft plastic at this scale, the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the government would support an export proposal “when there is an environmentally sound pathway for processing this material for recovery purposes offshore”. “Ideally, any exported soft plastics would be processed into recycled pellets that can be remanufactured in Australia,” she said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Sources said the sites being considered for recycling the soft plastic include a facility in Texas. The supermarket chains are also in discussions with recycling facilities in other countries. It is unclear how much of the stockpiled soft plastic is still in good enough condition to be recycled and how much has degraded. Some of it has been stored for at least four years while the company contracted to run the scheme, REDcycle, claimed it was being distributed for reuse and recycling. The supermarkets took responsibility for the stockpiles when the contractor went into administration last month. Last week, under the banner of the Soft Plastics taskforce, they released a “roadmap to restart” that said they hoped to roll out a nationwide in-store plastic collection next year, but indicated it may not be fully operational until 2025. The taskforce said it was working to restart in-store soft plastic collections urgently, but was “severely constrained” by Australia’s limited access to domestic recycling that could manage the “mixed polymer” soft plastic. The Boomerang Alliance, a coalition of 55 environment groups, said the plan was timid. Jeff Angel, the alliance’s director, said it read as though the supermarkets had only just discovered there was a problem with plastic recycling when the challenges had been clear for years. Angel accused the supermarkets of expressing “thought bubbles” and there was a significant risk that the 2025 target of 70% of plastic being recycled or composted would not be met. “Notably, there is no firm commitment by the supermarkets to use collected plastics as recycled content,” he said. Angel said it was “absolutely vital” that governments regulated to make recycling targets mandatory and require nationwide kerbside collection of soft plastic, a step proposed by the Victorian government. He said REDcycle had been collecting less than 1% of the 449,000 tonnes of soft plastic used by Australians each year, and a more ambitious solution was needed than what the supermarkets proposed. A spokesperson for the supermarkets said they recognised the need for a long-term national strategy to deal with the problem. A scheme that charges food and grocery manufacturers a levy to support soft-plastic recycling was being trialled in some areas. “We recognise that, in the long-term, more soft plastic could be diverted from landfill if future schemes are more convenient for consumers and can meet soft plastic at the point where it becomes waste – the household,” they said. “It is crucial that this opportunity to rethink Australia’s future national soft plastic recycling model is not overlooked.” Morrison announced plans to ban the export of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres in August 2019. He expressed concern about the amount of plastic waste ending up in the ocean and cited data suggesting just 12% of Australian plastic waste was recycled."

                    "bodyText": "An evidently tense, physically unassuming but determined-looking player, also from Afghanistan, drove his local cricket club to victory in Melbourne on my recent first umpiring gig in my new country. It was a nail-biting 45-over game down to the last ball, played under typical Melbourne conditions at the end of summer: glimpses of sunshine between constant mild showers. “This bloke looks too tiny for these shots”, remarked the square-leg fielder of the opposing side after a couple of sixes from the Afghan batting in the lower-middle order went flying out of the ground. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads He wasn’t wrong. The courage, timing and the hand-and-eye coordination displayed by this batter against a formidable bowling attack was indeed noteworthy, as he was playing his first season in an alien country. As we were preparing to resume the game after a rain-inflicted delay, I got a chance to chat with my countryman to find out that like me, he came to Australia as a refugee just over a year ago when the Taliban took over Afghanistan. “I used to live in Kabul. What about you?” he asked me without hiding his pleasant surprise at seeing a fellow Afghan supervising a club cricket match thousands of miles away from their native land. He was getting along well with everyone and his teammates were welcoming and supportive. The entire domestic cricket scene in Australia has been buzzing this season with a new cohort of energetic players from Afghanistan. As we headed back on to the ground, I saw him holding the shiny Kookaburra ball to lead the bowling attack. He did pretty well with his fast, swinging deliveries claiming a couple of early wickets before he tired after a few overs. I was sure things weren’t easy for him off the field – as, like me, he must have been on an agonising wait for a family visa. But, the Saturday cricket match was a lovely escape for both of us and so many more Afghans embracing the “gentlemen’s game” on a new level. As a club cricketer myself, I had skipped most of this season’s action for a weekend job to support my family back home. The daily allowance for umpiring wasn’t a bad bargain, especially after this action-packed game. The team batting second fought valiantly until the last ball. The Afghan player stole the show by uprooting a couple of last wickets in his second spell to seal victory for his side. At the end, there were hand-shakes all around to put an end to the hard-fought contest. On my long way back home, I was gripped by thoughts about the future for us newly arrived refugees in modern Australia, while comparing it to our predecessors who came here centuries ago – the Afghan cameleers. Those courageous men with camels faced daunting tasks in outback Australia back in those days, but remained subject to inhuman immigration restrictions, such as not being allowed to travel interstate for work, being forbidden from re-entering Australia if they left and not being allowed to hold a mining rights on the goldfields. The Labor government granting permanent residency to some refugees on temporary visas came to my mind as good news – but that pleasant thought didn’t last long, as I remembered that refugees were made to wait in limbo for more than a decade. This does not really seem like a welcoming gesture to someone like me, who has immediate family members still stranded in Afghanistan after the turmoil in August 2021. I know dozens of new Australians with complete sets of proper documents, working in the community and paying taxes, who are made to wait and wait to see their dear ones. Why can’t the Australian government be as welcoming and supportive to refugees as the Melbourne cricket clubs celebrating success and diversity together? • Shadi Khan Saif is an Afghan journalist based in Melbourne"

With the state election less that two weeks away, Guardian Australia has seen footage from a community event about the Hunter offshore windfarms in which Anderson can be heard remarking to a person beside her, “I don’t believe in climate change”. When contacted by Guardian Australia about the comment, she said it was not a declaration of her beliefs. “I made a clumsy joke in response to the previous speaker, but that was not a declaration of my beliefs,” Anderson said. “I understand that our climate is changing and the NSW government has great policies that preserve our environment for future generations, which I support.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The comments come after it was revealed Nationals candidate for Port Macquarie, local mayor Peta Pinson, told a meeting her scepticism about climate science had “solidified” after reading a paper. She is running in one of just two seats being contested by both a Liberal and National candidate. Nationals candidates are required to submit an extensive form when they apply to run for the party, including details about their support for the party’s policies, but the party embraces a “broad church”, a senior official explained. Pinson’s comments were deemed acceptable within that framework. Anderson made her comment on 7 March while sitting around a table of local residents in Doyalson asking questions about the offshore wind zone in the Pacific Ocean off the Hunter. Consultation for the proposed renewables project that the federal government claims could support the decarbonisation of the area - and create up to 8000 jobs - opened earlier this year, and has included a number of community discussions. Anderson only recently joined the Liberal party and was preselected for the near-unwinnable seat at the end of February. Labor’s Yasmin Catley held the Hunter region electorate on a 10% margin at the 2019 election. Opposition spokesperson Penny Sharpe said the Coalition needed to make sure all candidates were on the same page about climate change. “Climate change is not a joke,” she said. “Mr Perrottet and Mr Toole must guarantee all Liberal and National candidates support taking meaningful action on climate change.” So-called teal independent candidates running in key Liberal-held seats have been campaigning heavily on climate change action. Last week, key hopefuls joined kingmaker, independent Sydney MP, Alex Greenwich, to put forward a wishlist to be used should the NSW election result end up being a hung parliament. The Liberal party has defended its climate stance. “The NSW government has an outstanding track record of delivering renewable energy investment, ensuring energy security and addressing climate change,” a NSW Liberals spokesperson said “The Perrottet government’s long-term plan addresses challenges facing our state, including our net zero programs and policies that are helping to support industry to decarbonise, while promoting jobs and economic growth, and ensuring the delivery of reliable and affordable power.”"

                    "bodyText": "Constitutional conservatives raising doubts about the proposed wording of the referendum on an Indigenous voice to parliament have been accused of acting like “white saviours”, finding flaws with the proposal “just to stay in the spotlight”, according to a member of the government’s advisory group. Thomas Mayo, a Kaurareg and Kalkalgal Erubamle man and working group member, said it was now “crunch time” for the government’s relationship with the advisory group. “We are trying to land on a form of words that will give our people the most powerful voice possible, while also making sure we can still win the referendum,” he said. “We are dealing with the issue of people trying to gain prominence over this matter and act as white saviours. From our experience we know that too often you may fix one problem and they’ll go and find another one just to stay in the spotlight.” At least two other prominent members of the group have also spoken out against those they see as attempting to derail the voice. Prof Marcia Langton said there had been a “relentless scare campaign”, while Marcus Stewart has unleashed on the “relevancy-deprived, race-baiting constitutional conservatives chasing their two minutes of fame”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The referendum working group will meet on Thursday to decide on its final advice to government, including whether to support a proposed addition of words to the amendment suggested by the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, which would allow parliament to decide the legal effect of the voice’s representations. One member claims the change may have been designed to appease constitutional conservatives, a small number of whom raised concerns about court challenges arising from the voice’s ability to advise executive government. The group’s final advice will be considered by cabinet before the constitutional amendment bill will be introduced during the week of 27 March. Guardian Australia understands the group remains unanimous in supporting the voice’s power to advise executive government. The government is not obliged to accept the group’s advice, but advocates of the voice say not doing so would risk undermining the principle on which the consultation body is meant to operate – that Aboriginal people should have a say on matters that affect them. The Nine newspapers reported Dreyfus and the solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, had suggested an update to the constitutional amendment, to confirm the parliament could make laws about “the legal effect of [the voice’s] representations”. Dreyfus and the Attorney General’s Department were approached for comment. Working group members have expressed frustration at the way the suggested additional phrase was introduced, just before the last meeting, limiting their opportunity to fully consider its implications. After the meeting, Stewart on Thursday said the group wanted the amendment to be “as strong as possible” and that there was “no room for mediocrity in this process”. Prof George Williams, a member of the legal expert group, believed concerns about litigation over the voice’s representations were overstated. “This is the rule of law in action … It’d be unusual to put any part of the constitution beyond the audit of the courts. It’s their job to ensure people operate within the law, and that includes the voice,” he said. Some working group members believe the new wording would weaken the voice and lessen the government’s obligation to consult on matters of relevance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Langton, who along with Tom Calma wrote the 2019 co-design report favoured by the current government, said she believed the vast majority of Indigenous people supported their model, and that most Australians would vote for it. “It would be tragic if the referendum were voted down because of the relentless scare campaign from people who clearly do not understand the scale of the tragedy we are addressing,” she said. Stewart was also critical. “We have a duty and responsibility as the referendum working group. Let us do our job,” he said. Mayo pointed to views expressed by leading constitutional lawyer Bret Walker, who told the Financial Review of what he called a “doomsday borderline approach” from some lawyers. Mayo called on conservative constitutional experts “who say they support this, to back it”, saying the referendum “go down to the wire”. “Their actions could be the difference between winning and losing. So for something that is really a minor issue, we might waste this opportunity and it’s not their families who would suffer.”"

                    "bodyText": "Academic staff at multiple universities have spoken out about the outsourcing of courses to for-profit providers, saying it has led to “distressing” workloads, poor quality standards and aggressive marketing. “Some staff are too scared and clinging to their jobs to share [their] stories,” one academic told Guardian Australia. Australian universities now offer more than 850 courses, mostly online postgraduate diplomas or master’s degrees, where the course management, administration and marketing is contracted out to third-party online program management companies, or OPMs. Materials for outsourced courses are usually prepared by academic staff at the university before being provided to the OPM to administer. Different universities retain different levels of oversight of outsourced courses. Some universities provide teaching staff – although these are often different from the staff who design the course – while in other instances the oversight is more cursory. An academic at the University of Sydney, who asked to remain anonymous, told Guardian Australia the outsourcing arrangements at that university were almost “universally hated” by academics. The university announced last year it would offer four postgraduate degrees online in partnership with the multinational OPM 2U. The first classes began this year and about 30 staff are involved in unit design. The staff member said academics at the university had multiple concerns with how the courses were being rolled out. “First, the workload of designing a new class you get absolutely no credit for … it’s not considered a teaching load and you’re promised you’ll have help but you don’t.” Academics were given no teaching relief or extra compensation for their work, they said. “Second, you put your name on things but you don’t know how it’ll run. If a crappy experience happens, your name is still running on every slide. “And third, designing a course takes a lot of time, then someone else is the unit coordinator and might not be a specialist at all. There’s a complete disconnect between who designs the class and who runs it after that.” ‘You lose control of the material’ More broadly, there were also fears among staff at the university about the vast amounts of online content created by academics – both during the pandemic and for outsourced courses – being reused in ways they do not approve of, the staff member said. “If someone goes on strike, what prevents [the university] from using lectures? You lose control of the material. I like to think we’re a bit more than glorified YouTube videos, but you’re signing a blank cheque with your name on it.” Staff at USyd have held strikes on seven days since August 2021 – the longest-running campaign of work stoppages at an Australian university. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) is pushing for a pay rise in line with inflation, protection of the “40-40-20” rule balancing teaching and research roles and an increase in permanent positions for casual staff. A spokesperson for the university said it did not outsource any academic work or teaching to 2U, and every course included a weekly 90-minute Zoom class run by a USyd teacher who, in some cases, was the academic who designed the unit. “This gives students opportunities to build connections with each other and their teachers, and to put what they have learned into practice.” They said the courses were outsourced because “time-poor mature-age students prefer completing postgraduate studies online”. Guardian Australia asked a number of times whether the academics who ran the courses had PhDs in the areas they were teaching. The spokesperson said teachers were employed under the same hiring and contracting processes as all academic staff, with the same qualifications required by the regulator. “These units are coordinated and the teaching is led by experienced academic staff with PhDs in relevant fields and are fully compatible with our [Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency] requirements.” Student learning a ‘lower priority’ Another academic, who also asked to remain anonymous, said in his experience of developing a master’s course at James Cook University (JCU) for the OPM Keypath Education, “the student learning is very much a lower priority”. He told Guardian Australia the OPM used aggressive marketing tactics on prospective students. “Usually it’s just about marketing and getting them enrolled. After that they didn’t seem to care about the quality and were hard to work with to fix content.” JCU signed a 10-year agreement with Keypath in 2017 to initially deliver online master’s degrees in nursing and data science. It has since expanded to business and psychology, offering nine courses marketed under the brand “JCU Online”. Keypath runs the marketing and recruitment, course design and “student retention and success services”. Guardian Australia put questions to the company but they did not respond. The academic said the reuse of lecture material by someone other than the academic who created it is a problem across the tertiary education sector, not isolated to third-party providers. It was part of a broader move towards online education during the pandemic, he said. “Whether through online master’s or normal undergraduate courses, the reuse of video lecture material is a big issue.” Universities own the intellectual property that academics create in the course of their employment, including lecture content. “I don’t know if there’s any real ground [for staff] to stand on,” he said. A spokesperson for JCU said: “Working with an external provider has allowed JCU to broaden the reach of its courses, and to increase the range of flexible, high-quality courses it offers.” They said JCU provided the curriculum, teaching and assessment for all courses and the copyright and intellectual property remained with the university. Keypath delivered all non-academic support. “The courses are run by JCU staff who are fully qualified and accredited to run the courses. The course lecturers are tenured academics and there are also tutors who run some tutorials, and all are qualified and accredited,” they said. ‘Distressed staff’ Guardian Australia has also been shown several contemporaneous emails from staff at Australian universities complaining about workloads, quality standards and other issues in relation to the outsourcing of courses to OPMs. In one email, an academic asks for their name not to be used on the OPM platform due to being unhappy with the quality of the course content. In others, students expressed concern over poor standards. A senior academic at one top-ranking Australian university, who asked to remain anonymous and did not want their workplace disclosed for fear of repercussions, told Guardian Australia “there were unreasonable pressures on teaching staff to confirm to timelines provided by online service providers”. “We had some seriously overworked and distressed staff because of having to provide those services,” they said. “Academic staff were told the material they supplied to [the OPM] was ‘too academic’ and in-depth and that there was way too much reading. “They only schedule in reviews of material about every few years. Some staff are too scared and clinging to their jobs to share more stories.” ‘Brutal’ job cuts The national president of the NTEU, Dr Alison Barnes, said the union fiercely opposed any moves by universities to outsource teaching. “It undermines the pay and conditions the NTEU fought for under enterprise agreements,” she said. “Universities’ spending on staff as a percentage of their income is at historic lows. Investment in staffing fell from an average of about 52% between 2013 and 2019 to just over 41% in 2021. That shows the brutal job cuts the sector has endured. “Universities must come clean on exactly what their arrangements with online program managers are,” Barnes said. “The dramatic increase in third-party, for-profit companies delivering courses is a massive worry because it’s largely been obscured from the public’s view. The lack of accountability is just astounding. “Universities owe it to students, staff and the public to be upfront about exactly what’s going on here. The amount of unanswered questions around OPMs should ring serious alarm bells.” • This story was amended on 14 March 2023 to remove a quote from the Teqsa website that was mistakenly attributed to the spokesperson from the University of Sydney.

                    "bodyText": "When the ceiling of an upstairs bedroom in Dean Kahukiwa’s public housing unit in Sydney collapsed during a storm in February, the father of three immediately started calling for help. “I was watching it as it was happening, first the water started to come in through the window. Then it sort of spread across the ceiling towards the light and all of a sudden a crack started to appear. Then ‘whooosh’ it went,” he told the Guardian. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “I was in tears mate. I’m on the phone to housing, trying to get them to do something, they said we can send someone in 48 hours. I had to get the SES to come out and they did an inspection but they said it was too unsafe to go on the roof because no one had fixed the gutters.” A month later, nothing had changed. The room was covered in mould and debris from the storm, and mushrooms had begun to grow in the skirting boards of the bedroom. Yet Kahukiwa, a quietly spoken man, continued to live in the unit with his three boys, their belongings stacked up in the living room while the upstairs room remained uninhabitable. “I just feel embarrassed about it,” he said. “I know it’s not our fault but it does make me feel really down.” When the Guardian contacted the NSW Land and Housing Corporation last week, a spokesperson said it had been aware of the damage since 9 February and had planned to complete the work by this week. Kahukiwa was relieved on Monday when the repair work began, but he disputed the department’s claim that it had “commenced” repairs only five days after the storm. He said that before the damage occurred, he had repeatedly requested the gutters of the townhouse to be repaired, without luck. Two weeks after the storm, the gutters were repaired but the collapsed ceiling remained, he said. While housing – through rental and home ownership reforms – has dominated much of the looming NSW state election, the state of public housing has been largely absent from the agenda. But there have long been concerns about the state of the sector. New data released a few days before Christmas last year revealed there are now more than 50,000 people on the waiting list for public housing. Last week the Guardian reported new figures from the Community Housing Industry Association which revealed an 8% increase in the social housing waitlist in Sydney’s western suburbs, and 15% across the state. Previous reviews also paint a dire picture of the state’s failure to maintain an ageing public housing portfolio. In 2021, a parliamentary inquiry found the “current state of the housing portfolio and the lack of adequate resources to keep it in a suitable condition for occupation”. “The combination of an ageing housing stock and increasing demand for public housing has created a situation where the resources available cannot meet the needs of a vulnerable population,” the inquiry’s chair, Lake Macquarie independent MP Greg Piper said at the time. Maryanne Stuart, Labor’s candidate in the seat of Heathcote where Kahukiwa lives, came across his property while door-knocking in the lead up to the election. She was moved to tears when she realised he was still living in the property and had not been moved to crisis accommodation. “I do not believe that if someone from the department had actually come and looked at the property that Dean would still have been living there,” she said. “He was calling them daily, trying to get in contact, and no one had been out to see his home.” In its statement, the department spokesperson said Kahukiwa had remained in the property “as the two other bedrooms at the home are unaffected”. “The NSW Government and LAHC take all tenant concerns about safety within our properties very seriously,” the spokesperson said. Key to the 2021 inquiry’s concern was the split between public housing maintenance and tenancy services in NSW, which was “seen to be counterproductive by adding further layers of complexity and creating additional confusion for residents”. Labor has promised to address that problem by creating a new agency, Homes NSW, which would oversee the sector. It has also said it would require more new housing developments to include a proportion of social housing, while saying it would walk back the planned sale of some existing properties. Ned Cooke, from the Inner Sydney Tenants Advice and Advocacy Service at the Redfern Legal Centre, said stories like Kahukiwa’s were “extremely common”. “It’s a major issue and has been for a long time, and typically it’s the most major repairs where it’s really affecting the liveability of the housing are when it’s the hardest to get any action,” he said. While the issues with public housing maintenance were “multi-faceted”, the lack of coordination between the tenancy and maintenance services created a level of “accepted inefficiency” within the system. “It really is unacceptable and I suppose the devil is in the detail [on Labor’s policy] but anything which can remove that inconsistency or blockages in the system will help,” he said."

                    "bodyText": "He was the fantastic fox that derailed a multimillion-dollar plan to reintroduce endangered native species into one of Australia’s largest forests. But after a five-year hunt that involved 10,400 traps, 3,500 baits, 73 stakeouts, 55 days of scent-tracking dogs and 97 infrared cameras filming 40 hours a week, the red fox nicknamed Rambo is officially “no longer”. It means, for the first time in a century, greater bilbies are running wild in north-west New South Wales. The bilbies – of which there are believed fewer than 10,000 nationwide – are the first of six locally extinct or vulnerable species that the Australian Wildlife Conservancy with NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service will reintroduce to the sprawling wilderness between Narrabri and Coonabarabran known as the Pilliga Scrub. Next in line are bridled nailtail wallabies and brush-tailed bettong, with the vulnerable plains mouse and western barred bandicoot to be reintroduced in June and September. But it’s been a long time coming. AWC operates the largest private and donor-funded sanctuaries in Australia, with safe havens for endangered-species in Scotia and Mallee Cliffs (NSW), Yookamurra (SA) and Mt Gibson (WA). But none have faced the unique challenge that beset the 5,800-hectare conservation area in the Pilliga: a feral that couldn’t be caught. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “We see it occasionally in large-brained placental carnivores,” says Dr Tim Flannery, who followed Rambo’s story. “They don’t become smarter than their human hunters but they‘re better evolved than their brethren. Waiting them out siege-style becomes the only option.” Pilliga operations manager Wayne Sparrow has managed the hunt for Rambo for five years. “When we started fencing the enclosure in 2018, Rambo was just a kit and we reckon he lost his mother to a trap and a sibling to 1080-bait soon after,” Sparrow says. “That was his education, and it made him this reclusive, shy, intuitive animal. But he was no typical fox.” Sparrow says Rambo - named for Sylvester Stallone’s unkillable action hero – didn’t move with the cycles of the moon or use the same path twice. Nor could he be lured with baits like most foxes or trapped using snares like other ferals. “I came to respect him,” Sparrow says. “I knew I had to bring my A-game to ever catch him.” Smuggled into Australia in 1835 to be hunted, the red fox’s adaptability and intelligence allowed it to spread quickly across the nation. Today, Melbourne is estimated to have 20 foxes per square kilometre and Sydney 10. Last March, it was estimated that Australia’s 1.7m foxes kill in the vicinity of 367m mammals and 111m birds every year. In the Pilliga, as the hunt for Rambo stretched into years, Sparrow became increasingly desperate. He brought in Indigenous trackers, ex-military assassins, soft-jaw trap specialists, even a hunting-dog breeder who claimed to have bred a “beagle-kelpie fox-finder” hybrid. “At first every shooter and trapper wanted Rambo as a trophy,” Sparrow says. “But every one of them came, tried and left empty-handed.” Sparrow himself spent countless nights on a perch in the Pilliga with lure boxes laid and a thermal rifle at the ready. But to no avail. Now, despite Sparrow’s best efforts, Mother Nature appears to have done what he and a long line of hunters, scientists and rangers couldn’t, and outfoxed Rambo at last. Camera-trap footage last caught sight of Rambo on 9 October 2022. Since then, despite intensive monitoring and tracking, no evidence of the wily fox has been found. It is suspected Rambo died during one of two flooding events that hit the Pilliga in October last year “I am 100% confident he is gone,” Sparrow told the Guardian. “After a huge volume of work and a lot of stress, it’s over. Rambo will always be in my thoughts but he’s finally left my dreams.” In the years Rambo delayed a full-scale reintroduction, AWC released 60 bilbies into a temporary breeding area of 680 hectares in 2018. Ecologists now estimate the population to be 335. Bridled nailtail wallabies have flourished similarly with 42 originals now a mob of 148. This month, after adhering to eradication monitoring periods which require a fenced area to be clear of feral predators for a minimum of three months, AWC officially declared the enclosure “feral-free” and moved these pioneering colonies into the wider Pilliga. “Bilbies have lived in Australia for 15m years,” said AWC ecologist Dr Vicki Stokes. “The timing [for their reintroduction] is perfect. Good conditions in the forest over the last few years have meant that both populations of bilbies and bridled nailtail wallabies are doing exceptionally well and it’s good to get them out into the wider area so they can flourish.”"

                    "bodyText": "An energy security strategy will be launched “shortly”, Rishi Sunak has promised, with a focus on ramping up carbon capture and small modular reactors to develop homegrown energy and meet net zero commitments. Ministers have been forced to rework their plans after a ruling by the high court last July. It found that the government’s net zero strategy was unlawful due to a breach of the 2008 Climate Change Act, given the document did not outline how climate policies would meet legally binding carbon budgets. Campaigners have called for regulation to be cut for new clean energy projects in order to speed up Britain’s energy independence and for potential savings to be passed on to consumers. Sunak told reporters on his way to a trilateral meeting with the Australian and US leaders: “Shortly we will be outlining, in the energy security strategy, an approach forward.” He said it would focus on “carbon capture and storage, small modular reactors and the like”, and talked up the success of investment in research and development of energy sources such as offshore wind. “I am very confident that we will continue to have a very vibrant set of companies and jobs created in the UK as we transition to net zero, and our track record should give everyone confidence we know how to do this and get it right,” Sunak said. Sam Richards, the founder and campaign director of the “pro-growth” campaign group Britain Remade, blamed Britain’s energy insecurity for “surging energy bills and unsustainable levels of borrowing”. He promoted the benefits of small modular reactors, which the World Economic Forum has identified as a new breed of power source that does not emit greenhouse gases and is less exposed to traditional dangers such as earthquakes and meltdowns. The technology is sparking a renaissance for nuclear energy, with a range of next-generation small modular reactors being developed in the US. However, Richards said they would “not be delivered at the pace needed without streamlining the regulatory approval process”, and he called for a list of prospective places, including a list of decommissioned nuclear sites, to be drawn up. “The government will not be able to cut Britain’s dependency on expensive foreign gas and reduce energy bills without reforming the planning system that holds back clean energy infrastructure such as onshore wind, the cheapest form of energy available,” Richards said. “With the vast majority of major clean energy projects being developed outside London and the south-east, boosting investing in clean energy infrastructure will deliver a significant economic boost and job creation in Britain’s former industrial heartlands across the north and Midlands.”"

                    "bodyText": "Good morning. Everything Everywhere All at Once has dominated this year’s Oscars, winning seven awards including best picture in a big night for Asian and Asian American representation. The manic multiverse fantasy, about a fractured family swept up in an interdimensional adventure, also delivered wins for best actress, best director, best supporting actor, best supporting actress, best editing and best original screenplay at the 95th Academy Awards ceremony. It was the most nominated film of the night. Michelle Yeoh became only the second woman of colour to win the best actress Oscar, following in the footsteps of Halle Berry in 2002. “For all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight this is a beacon of hope and possibility,” she said, before adding: “Ladies don’t ever let anyone tell you you are past your prime.” Ke Huy Quan was named best supporting actor for his role in the film, beating Barry Keoghan and Judd Hirsch. He is the first Vietnam-born actor to win an Oscar. “Mom, I just won an Oscar!” he said tearfully. “They say stories like this only happen in the movies, I cannot believe this is happening to me.” How did Everything Everywhere All At Once sweep the Oscars? A combination of old-fashioned star power and zeitgeisty marketing captured Oscar voters (and audiences) across the board. Did anyone bring up the slap? Yes. Host Jimmy Kimmel laid into Will Smith, saying: “If anyone in this theater commits an act of violence at any point during the show, you will be awarded the Oscar for best actor and permitted to give a 19-minute-long speech.” Where can I find the full list of winners? All the winners and losers from the 95th Academy Awards are here. Tucker Carlson firestorm over Trump texts threatens to engulf Fox News Tucker Carlson was once seen as untouchable. Now the most popular TV host on American cable news is at the center of a firestorm threatening to engulf Fox News and also anger Donald Trump, whose conspiracy theory-laden political cause he has long championed and who his audience loves. Court filings attached to the $1.6bn Dominion Voting Systems defamation suit accuse Fox News of allowing its stars to broadcast false accusations about rigged voting machines in the 2020 presidential election. The documents contained numerous emails detailing the private views and concerns of senior Fox management and its stars, which often seemed at odds with what they were publicly broadcasting to their audience. While the anchors Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo have been singled out for pushing false claims of a fraudulent election, the fallout has landed primarily on Carlson. In group chats obtained by Dominion, the network’s biggest names – Carlson, Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity – appeared to doubt claims of election fraud that were featured prominently on the network. At the same time, the Fox owner, Rupert Murdoch, said in a court deposition that anyone who knowingly allowed lies to be broadcast “should be reprimanded, maybe got rid of”. Is Fox standing by its stars? So far, yes. On Thursday, Lachlan Murdoch, the eldest son, heir apparent and executive chair and chief executive of Fox Corporation, expressed support for management, its roster of stars and backed Fox News’s editorial standards. What else is happening? As Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Corporation battles to contain the Dominion lawsuit scandal that has engulfed its top executives and stars, another crisis is building that has the potential to cause further turbulence for the media empire. Republican response to the January 6 Capitol attack divides party Some Republicans have rebuked efforts by Donald Trump and the Fox News host Tucker Carlson to whitewash the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, underscoring a significant split in the party over attempts to downplay the day’s events. Kevin McCarthy, the House speaker, turned over more than 40,000 hours of security footage from the Capitol to Carlson earlier this year. This week, Carlson aired selectively edited portions of that footage, falsely claiming the rioters were “sightseers” and “not insurrectionists”. At least 1,000 people have been arrested for their role in the January 6 attack. Five people died as a result of it. More than 999 people have been arrested so far, according to the justice department. About 518 people have pleaded guilty to federal crimes to date and 53 have been found guilty at trial. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, quickly distanced himself from Carlson’s portrayal. “It was a mistake, in my view, for Fox News to depict this in a way that’s completely at variance with what our chief law enforcement official here at the Capitol thinks,” he said on Tuesday. What have some Republicans said? Thom Tillis, a Republican senator from North Carolina, said: “I think it’s bullshit. I was here. I was down there, and I saw maybe a few tourists, a few people who got caught up in things.” In other news … Donald Trump’s third national security adviser, John Bolton, did not brief the then president on suspicions Russia may be behind mysterious “Havana syndrome” attacks on US diplomats because he did not think Trump would support him. Bolton was national security adviser from April 2018 to September 2019. All toilet paper from across the world checked for toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” contained the compounds, and the waste flushed down toilets and sent to sewage treatment plants probably creates a significant source of water pollution, research has found. Nuclear-armed North Korea test-fired two strategic cruise missiles from a submarine on Sunday, the state news agency KCNA reported, just as US-South Korea military drills were due to begin. “Strategic” is typically used to describe weapons that have nuclear capability. Xi Jinping has stressed the need to oppose “pro-independence” influences in Taiwan, as he closed the National People’s Congress (NPC) after a week in which the rubber-stamp parliament handed China’s president an unprecedented third presidential term, and key roles at the top of the government were reshuffled. Don’t miss this: long shadow of US invasion of Iraq still looms over international order The French statesman Georges Clemenceau once said: “War is a series of catastrophes that results in a victory.” In the case of the invasion of Iraq, however, the war that began 20 years ago started in victory and has ended in a series of catastrophes, writes Patrick Wintour. The main US military pullout from Iraq was ultimately completed by 2011, finally answering the question posed by Gen David Petraeus during that first push to Baghdad in 2003: “Tell me, how does this end?” Yet the long shadow of the invasion still looms over the international order, staining the reputation of those who instigated it and the political process itself, and dealing a heavy blow to the self-confidence the west felt in the years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Climate check: Alaska protections announced as Biden reportedly prepares to approve huge oil project Joe Biden has announced steps to ban oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Ocean and limit onshore drilling in Alaska, as his administration reportedly prepares to approve a huge new oilfield in the state. Plans announced on Sunday night will bar drilling in nearly 3m acres of the Beaufort Sea – closing it off from oil exploration – and limit drilling in more than 13m acres in a vast swath of land known as the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. The moves come as regulators prepare to announce a final decision on the $8bn Willow project, a controversial oil-drilling plan pushed by ConocoPhillips in the petroleum reserve. Climate activists have rallied against the project, calling it a “carbon bomb”. Last thing: Hugh Grant, Malala and a donkey: the best memes and moments from the 2023 Oscars Hugh Grant stammered and equivocated his way through one of the more excruciating awards moments before the ceremony – in an interview that launched a thousand memes. “The whole of humanity is here … it’s Vanity Fair,” he said in a red carpet interview with the American model Ashley Graham, referring to the 1848 novel by William Thackeray. “It’s all about Vanity Fair – that’s where we let loose and have a little bit of fun!” beamed Graham in response, referring to the magazine that famously hosts an Oscars afterparty. Presenting an award later in the night, he referred to his face as a scrotum, possibly making him the first person to say “scrotum” at the Oscars (not factchecked, do not hold us to this). There was cringe. There was chaos. There was Cocaine Bear. Here are the other most viral bits from this year’s ceremony. Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

                    "bodyText": "Peter Dutton has suggested the Coalition would offer bipartisan support for cuts to the national disability insurance scheme to keep it “sustainable” and pay for the Aukus nuclear submarine acquisition. The former defence minister and opposition leader offered bipartisanship on budget savings ahead of Anthony Albanese announcing the submarine plan on Tuesday morning AEDT, with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the US president, Joe Biden. The Aukus plan to buy up to five Virginia class submarines before working jointly on a next-generation submarine with the UK is expected to cost hundreds of billions over several decades. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Asked if bipartisan support for Aukus would extend to giving the government leeway to make budget savings to pay for it, Dutton told ABC’s 7.30: “The short answer is yes.” “In my budget in reply speech last October I said that we would work with the government if they had tough decisions to take, for example, keeping the NDIS sustainable. “It’s an incredibly important program but it needs to be sustainable. And if the cost trajectory of that is going to result it in falling over, I think the government itself has pointed out that’s not sustainable.” “So, if there are different ways in which we can provide support to the government, we’re happy to do that.” Dutton noted spending for nuclear submarines was “over a long period of time”, into the 2050s and beyond, whereas the budget focused on “the next four years”. “There will always be points of difference about where spending priorities lay and we will work through that.” On Saturday, Albanese threw down the gauntlet to the opposition to back budget savings to pay for an increase in defence spending, promising that Labor “will” explain to the Australian public why it was worthwhile. “That’s why some of, frankly, the juvenile response of the opposition to some of the fiscal matters that are before us deserves contempt,” Albanese told reporters in India. The comments were a reference to the Coalition vowing to repeal Labor’s proposed reduction in tax concessions on super balances of over $3m, which the opposition branded an attack on middle Australia. “Australia faces real challenges,” Albanese said. “We have said very clearly and explicitly that there are major pressures on expenditure, not just in defence, but in other areas as well.” With more than half a million participants, the NDIS cost $35.8bn in 2022-23, making it the second largest social program after the pension. The NDIS is set to cost more than $50bn by 2026, the second fastest growing element of the budget after interest payments. Labor is reviewing the scheme, but has so far focused on the need to crack down on fraud rather than broader changes such as means-testing."

                    "bodyText": "What we learned today, Monday 13 March And that’s where we’ll leave you this evening. Thank-you for following along. Here’s a wrap of the main highlights today: Prime minister Anthony Albanese arrived in California and met with UK prime minister Rishi Sunak ahead of the Aukus submarine announcement tomorrow, along with US president Joe Biden. The deal is expected to cost an estimated $200bn over three decades. The Coalition’s defence spokesperson Andrew Hastie has pledged bipartisan support. An evacuation notice was issued to residents along Muttama Creek near Cootamundra due to flash flooding, however the alert was downgraded throughout the day as waters receded. Meanwhile, historic flooding in north-west Queensland continued with more rain forecast for tomorrow. A man who fired several shots at police vehicles in a Townsville suburb was found dead inside a home after a near 10-hour siege. Police said the man fired several shots, hitting nearby houses, a car and responding officers’ vehicles, however no one else was injured. Lifeline 13 11 14 / beyondblue 1300 22 4636 Everything Everywhere All at Once won big at the 95th Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles, taking out seven awards including best picture. Michelle Yeoh won the best actress Oscar for her role in the film, beating Australia’s Cate Blanchett who was nominated for Tár. Senator Penny Wong and Dr Helen Haines were awarded the 2022 McKinnon prize for political leadership. Wong was named the political leader of the year, while Haines was recognised as the emerging political leader of the year. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet defended a proposed future fund for the state’s children after being questioned on whether if favours wealthy families. He said low to middle income earners “will get an automatic $200 without having to make a co-contribution.” Labor leader Chris Minns criticised the policy, saying he would rather the money be spent on education. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced a state parliamentary inquiry into vaping, amid concerns children as young as primary school age are addicted to e-cigarettes. McGowan to visit Beijing next month Mark McGowan will become the first Australian state premier to travel to China since before the COVID-19 pandemic, AAP reported earlier today. Western Australia’s premier confirmed he plans to visit Beijing in late April to discuss the lucrative trade relationship between the two. He also expects to visit Guangzhou to address the resumption of direct flights between Perth and the massive port city. McGowan said: It obviously needs approval from the Chinese authorities but that’s the plan. Reinstating direct flights and making sure that the relationships, particularly in relation to our major export industries, remain strong (is the priority). WA exported $136 billion worth of goods to China in the 2022 financial year, with iron ore accounting for the bulk of the trade. Foreign minister Penny Wong travelled to China in December last year, the first visit by a federal government minister since 2019. Prime minister Anthony Albanese has also expressed interest in visiting. Trade minister Don Farrell is also preparing to visit China as the two nations continue talks on dropping billions of dollars worth of trade sanctions against Australian industries, including seafood, cotton and timber. Prime minister Anthony Albanese has taken to social media ahead of the Aukus announcement tomorrow morning: Queensland flooding continues but expected to ease Flooding in the north-west of Queensland continued today with a flood warning issued for the remote Burketown. Hundreds of residents have already been evacuated, however flooding is now expected to ease slowly. Storms are possible across the east and north of the state tomorrow, with localised heavy rainfall predicted between Mackay and Gympie. Meanwhile, a visitor to Burketown captured footage of an exhausted wallaby making its way out of the murky floodwaters to a dry bank: No-smoking means no vaping as Queensland rolls out new legislation in smoking crackdown People using vapes will not get a pass in no-smoking areas and there will be a crackdown on tobacco “chop shops” under new laws proposed in Queensland. Under legislation to be introduced to the state parliament this week, there will also be an expansion of smoke-free areas, a new licensing scheme and greater restrictions on cigarette sales in pubs and clubs. The bill comes after the state government ordered a parliamentary inquiry into the health risks of vaping and young people using e-cigarettes. Member for Dobell, Emma McBride, said on Afternoon Briefing that a working group had been established at a Commonwealth level to look into the issue: I was a pharmacist and someone accredited in nicotine addiction and smoking cessation, and what concerns me from hearing from the expert is the gateway, particularly for young people, from cigarettes into nicotine. We had some of the lowest rates of smoking around the world, and part of that is plain packaging and other reform where we have been really at the forefront globally … I have particular concerns when I hear from high school teachers about the real problems they are seeing in classrooms and playgrounds. Riverina MP, Michael McCormack, shared his own anecdote about vaping, arguing it is “out of control”: I went to a wedding and it was like every second young person [there] looked like Puff the Magic Dragon with fumes coming out of the nostrils. We need to do something, we need to act quickly, I commend the Queensland premier for what she is doing [and] I would urge and encourage federally to do everything we can. - with AAP Higher interest rates may have chipped away at property prices in the past year or so, but for most of the country, home values remain well above their pre-Covid levels, data firm CoreLogic says. Nationally, those prices remain about 14.8% higher than they were in March 2020, even after taking into account the slide of 9.1% or so since their peak. And with a “pause” nearing for the Reserve Bank (our bet is that there is another interest rate rise coming in April), the decline in prices may not go much further. Eliza Owen, CoreLogic’s head of research, said: It may be too early to call the ‘bottom’ of the downswing due to further rate increases, and a looser labour market, expected in the coming months. However, as the rate hiking cycle slows to a pause later this year, it is possible the housing market will revert to slower, steadier growth patterns. Adelaide houses have come out on top across the capital cities, sitting 43.7% higher than at the end of March 2020, CoreLogic said. That added $211,097 to the median house value in the South Australian capital, lifting it to $694,653. That increase compared with a median house value gain in Sydney of $119,830. Melbourne house values didn’t receive the same Covid kick (perhaps the lengthy lockdowns played a role), and median house values there are down $1,009 compared with March 2020. The relative “lack of stock” may be helping to stem the price falls, with annual sales volumes down 21.5% from their peak in December. That property prices are retaining much of their gains won’t be any consolation for renters, who have seen rent levels climb relentlessly after some declines at the start of Covid. Perth has seen among the biggest increases, with rents now 35.4% up over the past three years, compared with a national average of 23.1%. As CoreLogic notes, renters were accustomed to rises averaging 2.1% a year during the 2010s, so the past couple of years will come as a shock for many. Owen said: With net inflows [of migrants] expected to return to pre-pandemic levels this year, and a rental vacancy rate of just 1.0% in February, there is no indication of rents going backwards nationally. With approvals for new housing also on the slide, rental strain looks to be only getting worse. Cootamundra flooding advice downgraded to ‘monitor conditions’ Circling back to the flooding at Cootamundra, the advice has been downgraded to ‘monitor conditions’ as water levels continue to fall along Muttama Creek. Riverina MP, Michael McCormack, provided an update while appearing on Afternoon Briefing this afternoon: The waters of the creek have subsided which is good news … [There was] quite a storm and it rained out here in Wagga Wagga and it came down in buckets and the region was very hard hit [with] some trees down … [we] encourage anyone driving in that area to take every precaution. Mookhey says Perrottet’s savings fund voter pitch offers least benefit to those who need it most Labor NSW’s shadow treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, has been questioned about premier Dominic Perrottet’s pitch to voters that the government would contribute to a long-term savings fund for children under 10. On Afternoon Briefing, Mookhey argued that under the proposed scheme, families who need the most support will “benefit the least from this policy”: There is no doubt that this policy works best for children whose parents have the wealth to be able to make $1000 contribution per child each year every year for the next 18 years. It certainly is the case that the families who are doing [it] tough and interest rates are rising and rents are soaring, tolls are going up, certainly, they will not have the spare cash lying around in order to make a contribution, and those families will be worse off compared to those who are perhaps a little bit more affluent. Aukus announcement Albanese’s most significant since taking office The Aukus announcement will be Anthony Albanese’s most significant announcement since taking office. As the official unveiling tomorrow morning draws closer, many questions remain unanswered. My colleague Daniel Hurst has taken a look at some of the most pressing questions below: Wollongong mayor speaks about Port Kembla sub base speculation Also appearing on Afternoon Briefing is Wollongong mayor, Gordon Bradbury, who is speaking about speculation that Port Kembla is likely to be the preferred harbour for an East coast base for nuclear submarines, both visiting and owned. Bradbury said he doesn’t have a lot of detail on the topic and while the proposal has “a lot of challenges associated with it”, it could also expand the economic activity in Wollongong and the South Coast: [It] is going to be one of those long-term projects over decades that will probably inject a lot of activity into local communities as well as the economy. Overall, the mayor’s biggest concern appears to be existing congestion at Port Campbell. Bradbury said: Port Campbell at the present time is very congested, so I hope the plan means that there will be an expansion of the port as well. …the port is very well utilised at present [so] the logistics of dealing with Defence as well as all the other activities taking place … the materials in and out of the port as well as servicing it with the personnel, that’s going to be the big challenge for the future. Australia Institutes’s Behm anticipates much ‘political theatre’ tomorrow Director of the Australia Institute’s International &amp; Security Affairs Program, Allan Behm, has just appeared on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing. Speaking of the Aukus announcement due tomorrow morning, Behm said he anticipates that “we will have a lot of political theatre tomorrow”: It’s not often that an Australian prime minister, the US president and British prime minister minister get-together [at] an aircraft carrier in San Diego next to [a] Virginia-class submarine. I think it is a last performance. I think what the Government is keen to do now is to get this off the table … Aukus has taken up a lot of bandwidth, a lot of time, and I suspect that the prime minister and the cabinet will be pretty keen to get back to [Australia]. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has met with Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, where they discussed a number of issues, mainly the Aukus submarine unveiling, which will take place tomorrow. Albanese told Sunak the agreement “builds on our long-term relationship”: Aukus has been a lot of hard work but it is in the three countries’ interest … we see that as an investment in our capability but at the same time, we are investing in our relationships in the region as well. Sunak said the agreement is important to “demonstrate our commitment to the values that we both have”. Minister will soon be handed report on TikTok The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, will soon receive a review into privacy, political censorship and disinformation on the Chinese‑owned social media app TikTok, AAP is reporting. The US, Canada and the European Union have banned government employees from having TikTok on work-issued devices. Minister for the environment and water, Tanya Plibersek, has urged the community to reconsider the apps they use and what data they are handing over. She said: It’s important to know what you’re letting yourself in for when you’re participating in social media in this way. It’s important that you know what your kids are downloading on to their phones as well. Plibersek added that when it came to social media apps, “if it’s for free and it seems too good to be true, it probably is”. MP Alicia Payne tweets a ‘Happy Birthday Canberra’ message Member for Canberra, Alicia Payne, has taken to social media to show her appreciation for the nation’s capital on Canberra Day. Canberra Day is a public holiday commemorating the official naming of the city, held on the second Monday of March in the ACT. Payne said Canberra, today celebrating its 110th birthday, was “established to be the meeting place of our democracy and the home of the Australian public service, serving our Government and through it our nation … delighting and inspiring us”: Grocery bill stress reaches record high in March New research by Finder has found that Australian households are paying thousands of dollars more for groceries year on year, with grocery bill stress reaching a record high this month. The average Australian household spent $185 on their weekly groceries in February 2023, up $37 a week compared to last February, according to the research. That is an increase of $1,924 per household over 12 months, or $18.8 billion more nationwide. The research also shows one-third of Australians (33%) are at the shops every few days, while more than half (53%) shop once a week. Around 9% go food shopping once a fortnight, while just 1% can stretch supplies all month. Sarah Megginson, money expert at Finder, said Australians are “having to change how and where they shop just to keep food on the table”. Grocery bill stress reached a record high in March, with 43% of Australians ranking groceries as one of their top three most stressful expenses – the highest level since Finder’s Consumer sentiment Tracker started in April 2019. An Everything, Everywhere kind of wrap for the Oscars The 95th Academy Awards Ceremony has wrapped up in Los Angeles and Everything Everywhere All at Once was the big winner, taking out seven awards including best picture. Michelle Yeoh also won the best actress Oscar for her role in the film, beating Australia’s Cate Blanchett who was nominated for Tár. Thanks Natasha, and good afternoon everyone! Stay tuned as we continue to bring you the latest. Thanks for your attention today. Emily Wind now has the blog! Australian Ethical offloads Lendlease shares over development threat to koala population My colleague Lisa Cox today reported that one of Australia’s leading ethical investment managers says it has sold its shares in Lendlease over concerns a planned housing development in south-west Sydney threatens the survival of Sydney’s largest healthy koala population. The Mt Gilead development proposes more than 3,000 additional houses in the Campbelltown local government area, which includes habitat for koalas. Australian Ethical Investment has also taken to social media to encourage followers to email the NSW environment minister, James Griffin, about their concerns for the koala population if the development goes ahead. You can support the cause by emailing the NSW minister of the Environment about the impact of the Lendlease Mt Gilead development on koalas. The issues around Sydney’s growing pains was the subject of a major investigation by Anne Davies and Cox which if you missed, you can catch up here: Dominic Perrottet says ‘never’ any pressure from clubs lobby to remove former gaming minister New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has denied removing a senior minister from the state’s gambling portfolio due to pressure from the powerful clubs lobby, saying he was “never under pressure” over the decision. Less than two weeks out from the NSW state election, today Perrottet was forced to deny claims he removed senior Liberal minister Victor Dominello from his position as NSW gaming minister during his first reshuffle as premier in December 2021 due to pressure from the clubs lobby, which was allegedly unhappy at his push for gambling reform. Baby kangaroo rescued from Queensland floodwaters Police have rescued a baby kangaroo from floodwaters in Burketown in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Queensland. “Shh, it’s alright mate,” the officers said as they pulled the drenched animal into their boat and returned to dry land. Police say a helicopter pilot flew over at the time and spotted two very large crocodiles nearby. NZ hikes welfare payments as fruit and vegetable prices soar The New Zealand government has bumped up welfare payments and government support as food prices soar, AAP reports. New data released by Stats NZ today showed the cost of fruit and vegetables grew by 23% in the past year - the largest single-year jump in 34 years. Grocery food prices were also up 12%, led by increasing prices for eggs, potato chips and cheddar cheese, Stats NZ said. The rising prices come as New Zealand endures an economy-wide inflation challenge in the wake of Covid-19, exacerbated by wet weather and, most recently, huge storms. Vegetables NZ chair John Murphy said: Vegetable growers have endured exceptionally bad growing weather for several months now. Months of wet, humid and unpredictable weather have affected growers’ ability to plant and harvest. Most graphic have been the pictures of onions in drains in Pukekohe and on beaches and in drains in Hawkes Bay, plus the news that up to 90% of Northland’s kumara (sweet potato) production has been wiped out by Cyclone Gabrielle. In response, the government has opted for a higher-than-usual annual rise in government payments. In recent years, benefits have been indexed to the average wage rise, but Prime Minister Chris Hipkins today said the government would lift payments by 7.22% this year in line with headline inflation. The package of bread and butter support we are announcing today will help people who are really feeling the bite from the rise in the cost of living. The Coalition’s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, has pledged bipartisanship on the overall Aukus deal, saying it is “truly a multigenerational nation-building task for the Australian people” and that it “cannot fail”. Hastie told reporters in Parliament House in Canberra that the opposition welcomed early reports of plans for the “rapid acquisition” of Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines from the US, saying that it would partly answer the rapidly deteriorating strategic situation in the Indo-Pacific (that is code for China). Amid predictions Aukus could support up to 20,000 jobs in Australia over the long-term, Hastie added: It’s an opportunity for young Australians who want to cut steel on submarines, those who want to be engineers, those who want to work in advanced technology, and those who want to become experts in nuclear science … One of the things I’m most excited about, the opportunity in education this presents for young Australians. I want to see our primary, secondary, and tertiary educations sending the signals to young Australians that Aukus is something they should pursue as a career. While pledging bipartisanship overall, Hastie made clear this stance would not stop the opposition from performing a traditional accountability role in scrutinising program delivery, sequencing and cost: Of course, tomorrow morning we’ll be very interested in the timing of this, how long it will take to get the first Virginia-class submarines, how long it will take to built the joint sub with the UK; and we’re looking for significant budget investment. Hastie noted renewed talk that the program could cost up to $200bn over the long term, and added: We know that money doesn’t grow on trees. This will take some hard choices and it’s important that we make clear that we’re going to work with the government bipartisanly in making sure that we can deliver these submarines. Hastie said the program would require “a level of bipartisanship that we probably haven’t seen for a generation”. Pressed on the Coalition’s recent opposition to very modest superannuation changes – and how that fitted with the overall budget task to make Aukus a success – Hastie said: Let’s see what the costings are when we get to tomorrow and potentially the budget. Of course we’re going to work with the government to make sure that we can finance this because, as you know, it’s a very competitive environment [for budget funds]. There are a lot of wants out there and we can’t fund them all. And if we’re committed to Aukus then we need to make sure that we finance it properly. Tom Armitt from the Queensland police has been speaking with ABC News about the record floods in Queensland’s Gulf country, which has been one of the biggest wet seasons on record. At this stage pretty much every community in the gulf area of northern Queensland’s cut off. So, they have been for a number of months, for the duration of this wet season. So, ongoing since mid-December of 2022 we’ve been doing aerial resupplies into those communities. They’ve been managed by the local disaster management groups or by a district group. However, that obviously ramped up once we had that significant rainfall last week, dumping over half a metre across those catchments. We’ve had a number of areas flood. The worst being Burketown, the township itself. But a number of isolated cattle properties are throughout the north and we’re working towards resupply of those areas for an extended period of time. And then looking to repair and repatriate once the floods recede. … It’s about 3 tonnes of essential goods going on a daily basis into the Gulf. On alternate days, Doomadgee may receive a 3-ton resupply, we’ll fly into Mornington Island, we’ve been supplying Normanton and Burketown as well. Amitt says emergency services are attempting to provide supplies to a “substantial” area: Almost the entire Gulf is a sea of water. There’s also some significant flooding to our west of Mount Isa along the Georgina catchment, that’s affecting communities. ‘Treat abortion as other essential healthcare’: Greens launch campaign for accessible reproductive health We mentioned on the blog earlier that the NSW Greens were launching their plan for accessible reproductive rights ahead of the March election. Deputy leader of the Australian Greens, Mehreen Faruqi, launched the campaign with the NSW Greens candidate for the upper house Amanda Cohn, promising to make all public hospitals provide abortions. Faruqi said: Governments must listen to the community and treat abortion as other essential healthcare - provided in public hospitals, free and covered by medicare. Woman and child die in car crash in south-west Sydney A woman and child have died after a crash in Sydney’s south-west. A northbound cement truck and an SUV were involved in the incident in the northbound lanes this morning on the Hume Motorway, police said. Emergency services were called to the scene at Menangle Park at about 11.20am and found that the female driver and a child had died. Paramedics are assisting a second child, with a helicopter landing a medical team nearby. The truck driver was not injured and has been taken for mandatory drug and alcohol testing. Police have established a crime scene which will be examined by specialist police from the Crash Investigation Unit. A report will be prepared for the coroner. Crocodile warning as record-breaking floods continue Residents who refused to evacuate their homes in Far North Queensland are being urged to stay out of the flood waters with crocodiles spotted in the debris. Flood waters are starting to slowly ease in remote Burketown and the emergency has shifted south to Urandangi, with 16 people so far evacuated as water levels start to rise. Air assets are stationed nearby and on standby for emergency rescues and transport of food, water and medical supplies, Senior Sergeant Adrian Rieck from the Mount Isa District Disaster Coordination Centre said. He said: Water reserves and food supplies are good, and resupply continues. Telstra Services have also been restored to the area. - AAP Queensland’s department of transport has shared some of the images of significant road damage which can be seen as floodwaters recede. The Barkly Highway remains closed between Mount Isa to Camooweal. Key events leading up to decision on nuclear submarines AAP have taken us on a little stroll down memory lane, with a timeline of all the key events that have led up to the big unveiling of the Aukus deal which will take place tomorrow – or technically Monday local time in California. Late 2019: Scott Morrison tasks defence officials to look into feasibility of acquiring nuclear powered submarines after doubts over the French contract. May 2021: Morrison presents Aukus proposal to full national security committee and is given permission to approach US and UK leaders with an official government policy. June 2021: Morrison meets with US president, Joe Biden, and then UK prime minister Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the G7 and agree to an in-principle deal. September 2021: The deal is publicly unveiled, with Morrison announcing it in Canberra flanked by TV screens of the US and UK leaders. An 18-month consultation period begins into how Australia will acquire nuclear powered submarines and which model it will go with. May 2022: Labor wins the federal election, triggering a change in government. August 2022: The defence minister, Richard Marles, announced a review into the defence force and how it will tackle emerging threats to run alongside the Aukus consultation period. December 2022: Marles and the foreign minister, Penny Wong, meet with their US counterparts in Washington for the annual Ausmin meeting. January 2023: Australian government finalises submarine pathway. February 2023: Australian and UK defence and foreign ministers meet for annual Aukmin consultation. February 2023: Defence force review is handed to the prime minister and defence minister. A government reply is expected in April. March 2023: the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, Biden and UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, unveil the pathway forward to acquiring nuclear powered submarines. Cootamundra flash flooding warning downgraded to Watch and Act An evacuation order for flash flooding in Cootamundra, NSW has been downgraded to a Watch and Act as water levels begin to ease at Muttama Creek. The SES are warning residents not to enter flood water and to remain alert for any changes in advice, with more showers and thunderstorms forecast. ACT Senator David Pocock and Wentworth MP Allegra Spender have congratulated Senator Penny Wong for winning the McKinnon Prize for political leader of the year and given a shoutout to their fellow independent MP Helen Haines who was recognised as an emerging political leader. The 95th Academy Awards are under way in LA, with many Australians in attendance and up for awards. As Guardian Australia’s lifestyle editor, Alyx Gorman, points out, Cate Blanchett and Nicole Kidman’s luminous red carpet looks are down to more than just what outfits they’ve chosen this evening, with evidence of a skincare routine that defies the harsh Australian sun. Nationals leader David Littleproud wants a regulatory model to legalise vaping products put in place in order to crack down on the thriving e-cigarette black market. He has told the Australian that together with Pat Conaghan, he will push his partyroom to adopt a formal position on vaping next week when parliament returns. Littleproud said: We need to regulate further. The regulations put in under Greg Hunt haven’t worked. The market has moved so far now that children have become exposed and the government needs to regulate urgently, particularly about the flavours and types of vapes that are sold, and where they’re sold. Conaghan said: We have to treat it the same as cigarettes, it needs to be regulated and we can take the excise from it, which is a tick for government, but we also need to treat it as a health issue. The problem of how the next generation became hooked on vaping has been the subject of a major investigation by Guardian Australia’s medical editor, Melissa Davey, at the end of last year. New ABC chief content role goes to Netflix executive Netflix’s director of production for Australia and New Zealand, Chris Oliver-Taylor, is set to jump ship to the national broadcaster. Oliver-Taylor has been appointed to the newly created role of chief content officer at the ABC, in which he will be responsible for the new division created from the merger of the entertainment and specialist and the regional and local divisions. Oliver-Taylor had previously held roles at the ABC as well as the BBC, NBCUniversal and Fremantle Asia Pacific. ABC managing director David Anderson praised Oliver-Taylor’s experience locally and internationally and his “well-honed sense of audience expectations and creative trends across platforms and technologies”. I am very pleased that a leader of Chris’ experience and calibre is joining us for the next stage of the ABC’s story. Oliver-Taylor said he was “absolutely thrilled” to bring his experience to the role at a vital time in the ABC’s history. In a time of infinite choice across screen, audio and digital, we must deliver high quality and impactful content that resonates with all Australians, and I know to deliver this impact you can only do it with an amazing team. Anna Mallett, Netflix’s vice-president, production, for APAC/EMEA/UK, said: Chris is hugely talented and has made significant contributions leading our studio in Australia and New Zealand since joining Netflix. We are enormously grateful to Chris, wish him every success for the future and look forward to working with him again as a content partner. ’Twas the night before Aukus, when all through the house. Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. Except for the following: The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has declared “a new dawn for Australia’s defence policy” as he prepares to announce the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine plan tomorrow. Albanese gave some brief remarks to reporters in San Diego, California, during a bayside walk with the chief of the Royal Australian Navy, Vice-Admiral Mark Hammond (both were wearing Rabbitohs caps). Speaking on the eve of the joint announcement – which will be made alongside the US president, Joe Biden, and the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak – Albanese said: A new dawn in San Diego and a new dawn for Australia’s defence policy tomorrow. Reports published late last week suggested Australia would buy between three and five Virginia class submarines from the US by the 2030s, before moving to a British designed submarine with heavy use of US technology as a longer term solution. Robodebt inquiry commissioner praises ‘committed’ coverage by Guardian Australia My colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes has been recognised by the Walkley awards for his coverage of the robodebt scandal, but at the conclusion of the royal commission into the illegal scheme the commissioner has also praised his committed coverage of the inquiry itself. The former Queensland supreme court chief justice overseeing the commission singled out reporters from Guardian Australia alongside the Saturday Paper for their “committed” coverage of the evidence. The commissioner, Catherine Holmes SC, took a few minutes to make observations about media coverage of the proceedings, calling it a “remarkably useful and important public service”, while criticising many other media outlets for their “patchy” coverage. Heavy rainfall could cause flash flooding in parts of NSW, BoM warns As residents in low-lying parts of Cootamundra are being warned to evacuate this morning, the Bureau of Meteorology is warning other parts of NSW could also see flash flooding. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding in parts of the Mid North Coast, Hunter, Central West Slopes and Lower Western regions of NSW. The Bureau of Meteorology is saying the conditions could affect Port Macquarie, Taree, Kempsey, Maitland, Parkes and Condobolin. 60,000 Victorians benefit from landmark sick pay scheme for casuals The Victorian government’s landmark sick pay scheme for casual workers has paid out $22m since it was launched last year. Government minister Colin Brooks on Monday announced 60,000 Victorians have signed up to the pilot program, which provides up to 38 hours a year of sick and carer’s leave for casual and contract workers at the national minimum wage. He said since the scheme launched on Labour Day last year, more than $22m has been paid to support more than 93,000 claims for sick and carer’s pay: Casual and contract workers are telling us that when given a choice – a proper choice – they will choose to stay home and recover when they’re sick. We’ve already supported workers when they need it most – with more than one million hours of sick and carer’s pay. This scheme is protecting more and more Victorians and giving them the support they need when they’re sick or caring for a loved one. Brooks said 41% of workers surveyed said they would have gone to work unwell if they had not registered for the scheme. The premier, Daniel Andrews, unveiled the pilot in March last year to mark Labour Day – a public holiday with its origins in the union movement’s fight for an eight-hour working day. It was designed to help 150,000 casual and contract workers in hospitality, retail, aged and disability care, cleaning and laundry services, security and the supermarket and supply chain industries. Andrews said the pandemic had exposed the “completely and utterly toxic” nature of insecure work, with some casual and contract workers forced to choose between feeding their family or going to work while infected with Covid, as they could not afford to take time off. The $245.7m pilot is fully funded until March 2024. Helen Haines receives McKinnon prize for emerging political leader of the year Independent MP Helen Haines was awarded the McKinnon prize for emerging political leader of the year for her commitment to integrity in politics, culminating in the parliament legislating a national integrity commission in 2022. In accepting the prize, Haines thanked her constituents for their ongoing support: It is the honour of a lifetime to represent the people of Indi in the federal parliament, and it is the people of Indi who have spurred me on in my work to improve integrity, accountability and transparency in federal politics. The establishment of the national anti-corruption commission is the most significant integrity reform at a federal level in more than 40 years and I am incredibly proud to have played a role in that, and look forward to continuing to work to improve integrity and transparency in politics. I also look forward to continuing working to improve healthcare in regional and rural Australia, tackling the local housing crisis and implementing action on climate change that benefits regional Australia. I pay tribute to the Susan McKinnon Foundation and their work to improve Australia’s democracy and to all of the prize nominees. The judging panel particularly praised the way Haines connected her work in her electorate to her national policy work, highlighting the way she worked with her constituents to develop a set of principles to guide a federal integrity commission (known as the Beechworth principles). Member of the selection panel, chancellor of Macquarie University and former senior public servant, Dr Martin Parkinson, said: Helen wasn’t the only one to have made integrity an issue, but what was truly outstanding was the way in which she gradually built support across her community and across the broader parliamentary community. Politics is the art of the possible, and that’s something that you can be dismissive of, but what she did was to find a way to walk a path through all the competing groups and [end] up with a policy position that everybody could come in behind. Helen did something unusual in that she engaged her local community on the integrity principles. It showed proper grassroots democracy. She took up an issue – that for many people was probably distant – and gave them a mechanism whereby they could contribute. Wong recognised for leadership in McKinnon prizes In more award news closer to home, the foreign minister, Penny Wong, says she is honoured to receive the McKinnon political leader of the year prize. The selection panel recognised Wong for her “swift and demonstrable progress in re-setting Australia’s foreign policy agenda,” restoring Australia’s diplomatic relationships through a “listen first, talk second” approach. Wong said on receiving the prize: The Albanese government faces the world as it is, and we seek to shape it for the better. As foreign minister this means using all elements of our power – strategic, economic, social and diplomatic – to advance our interests and values. I’ve placed a priority on re-engaging with our region and renewing our relationships. I thank the Susan McKinnon Foundation and the University of Melbourne for the work they do to advocate for democracy and encourage strong political leadership. Selection panellist and former Victorian premier John Brumby hailed Wong as a “true statesperson”. Penny Wong … has consistently represented Australia’s best interests through her calm yet commanding diplomacy. She is highly effective internationally and displays the values Australian’s respect in their political leaders. Penny has shifted the tone of Australia’s international dialogues and relationships for the better. She’s been engaging but firm building genuine relationships in the Pacific, as well as refreshing and restarting our relationship with China and we’re seeing the benefits of that now. NSW opposition leader says proposed children’s future fund ‘very expensive’ New South Wales Labor leader Chris Minns has labelled the Coalition government’s flagship election commitment of a new children’s future fund as “very expensive”, criticising the policy for driving up the state’s debt levels. On Sunday the premier, Dominic Perrottet, announced a new fund which would see the government match parent contributions up to $400 each year until the age of 18. Today, Minns criticised the policy, saying he would rather the money be spent on education. He said: The single best investment we can make in the next generation of young Australians is to ensure we’ve got a world-class education system in this state. When you consider that we have nearly $200bn worth of debt, the equivalent of that debt for every man, woman and child in NSW is over $20,000 per person in this state. We need to make decisions about what’s affordable. Best in Show named at Crufts Dog Show If you were thinking that the Oscars was the most important awards ceremony happening today, you might want to think again, as the winners are being named in UK Kennel Club’s Crufts Dog Show. A Lagotto Romagnolo named Orca has been named Best in Show. Archie the doberman placed first in the working dog category, while nine-year-old staffordshire bull terrier Stella won the Hero award for eight-and-a-half years working with the police. We mentioned on the blog just now that Australian Callum Robson has scored a perfect 10 in the World Surf League’s competition in Portugal. If you want to see Robson flawlessly moving through the barrel for yourself, here’s the footage: Australian Ethical offloads Lendlease shares over development threat to koala population One of Australia’s leading ethical investment managers says it has sold its shares in Lendlease over concerns a planned housing development in south-west Sydney threatens the survival of Sydney’s largest healthy koala population. Australian Ethical has divested $11m in shareholdings in the property developer’s listed assets, saying Lendlease had failed to provide “critical information” about the width of planned koala corridors at stage two of its Gilead housing development. Australian surfer nails perfect 10 in Portugal Australia’s Callum Robson has held his nerve to produce the first perfect 10-point ride of the World Surf League championship season in the nick of time, AAP reports. Robson was facing an early exit from the Rip Curl Pro Portugal and needed a big score in the dying minutes of his elimination round heat against Brazil’s Gabriel Medina and Frenchman Maxime Huscenot at Supertubos Beach on Sunday. When a huge wave appeared, he launched into a deep drop, barely making the bottom turn then disappearing from view, before rocketing out of the tube and drawing a 10 from the judges to advance. 22-year-old Robson said: It feels really good, especially in a moment where I needed it the most. I was so happy, I was clapping so hard that my hands got sore.” Following the men’s elimination round, competition in Peniche was put on hold while organisers waited for the massive swell to ease down and the tide to turn. Later in the day, Robson also advanced through his round of 32 match-up over compatriot Liam O’Brien, while a number of big names bowed out. Former world champions Kelly Slater and John John Florence were eliminated as was current world No 2 Brazil’s Felipe Toledo and No 4 Italian Leonardo Fioravanti. While two round of 32 heats are still to be completed, five Australians including Robson and rankings leader Jack Robinson are through to the round of 16. Robinson next takes on compatriot Ryan Callinan. Oscars red carpet under way The Oscars red carpet is under way, and you can follow on our live blog here: If you’re in front of a TV and want to watch it for yourself, 7Bravo is carrying E!’s red carpet coverage from 8am AEDT. The full ceremony starts on Channel 7 and 7Plus at 11am AEDT, finishing at 2pm AEDT. The NSW SES have warned residents along Muttama Creek to evacuate now due to flash flooding. SES had issued a flood warning before 9am this morning as 93mm had already fallen at Berthong Road and more showers and storms are forecast today. A man who fired several shots at police vehicles in a Townsville suburb has been found dead inside a home after a near 10-hour siege, AAP reports. Queensland police declared an emergency about 9pm on Sunday for an area of Kirwan bordered by Dalrymple Rd, Kern Brothers Dr, Sandstone Dr and Golf Links Dr. The emergency declaration followed earlier reports a man armed with a gun was alone in a home in Elphinstone Dr. Police said the man fired several shots, hitting nearby houses, a car and responding officers’ vehicles. Residents within the exclusion zone were urged to stay inside their properties and lock their doors during the siege. Police revoked the emergency order at 6.45am after entering the dwelling and finding a 50-year-old man dead. A crime scene has been declared and a report will be prepared for the coroner. No one else was injured. Lifeline 13 11 14 / beyondblue 1300 22 4636 The Aukus agreement will be announced (officially) tomorrow, with Anthony Albanese in San Diego with both the US president, Joe Biden, and the British PM, Rishi Sunak, to set out the details (the details they are making public anyway). The Coalition, which signed the agreement under Scott Morrison, is very onboard, leading to a rare moment of bipartisan agreement between Labor’s Tanya Plibersek and Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce on the Seven network this morning. Even though it is going to cost (an estimated) $200bn (BILLION) over three decades. Plibersek: I think it’s very clear that both the government and the opposition agree that this is an important capability for Australia. These submarines will be very important in our ability to defend ourselves in the future. It’s a very long‑term project and with it will come a substantial number of jobs and huge investment and a real capability in the Australian economy. If we want to be an advanced manufacturing economy, these sorts of projects will really support that, so it’s great for the defence of the nation. It’ll mean thousands of extra jobs and, of course, it lifts our ability as a nation that can make things. Joyce: I’m glad that they’re looking at buying them off the shelf to start off with. That will reduce costs and also allow us to buy a Virginia‑class submarine, which has already had the ticks taken out of it, rather than trying to design it from the start, which obviously comes with delays. This is the cost of defending our nation. It’s one of the primary jobs of government up there with cost of living, and what we’ll see is really – I understand about manufacturing jobs, but its main job is to protect Australia. That’s the main job. But it’s only part of a platform that defends Australia. We have to be as strong as possible, as quickly as possible in every facet, and that’s agriculture, manufacturing; and to do that you need basic things right, like low power prices, to make sure that we have the capacity to pay for it, because it’s alright buying them, but then the job comes of paying for it, and that needs a vibrant economy to do so. Reconstruction fund agreement fuels hope for safeguard mechanism The agreement the Greens struck with the government over the national reconstruction fund has given hope that an agreement could be reached on the safeguards mechanism. David Pocock is not happy with the unlimited carbon credits included in the bill, which he says could mean that companies could increase their pollution, and just buy more credits to offset it. JLN senator Tammy Tyrrell said she wanted to see any carbon credits bought in Australia, not overseas. There’s a company here in Tasmania called LMS energy. They’re actually drilling on all tips like refuse tips, and they’re harvesting methane and they’re 100% utilising the energy that they produce, and they sell clean carbon credits … I’d rather [that they buy] their carbon credits at a reasonable price here in Australia rather than buying carbon credits from overseas. Tyrrell said she hadn’t put it on the line, but that she wanted people to think about where companies might be buying their carbon credits from. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has announced a state parliamentary inquiry into vaping, amid concerns children as young as primary school age are addicted to e-cigarettes. Nicotine vapes are illegal in Queensland without prescription, but are still sold online and in some stores. Palaszczuk says her government is moving to set up this inquiry because of the proportion of people vaping: At the moment they don’t know what they are inhaling. These vapes can contain toxic chemicals, like [those in] nail polish, nicotine, ingredients that are in bug sprays. It is not clearly labelled on these vapes. They are being portrayed as being like a lolly, flavoured, whether they are blueberry, watermelon, banana, so, young people are, of course, very attracted to it. Even adults don’t know that these are highly addictive substances that I feel is a like a back door for some big companies to infiltrate the younger generation. I’m particularly concerned about children in primary school. I hear reports that teachers are saying that they know young children are vaping in lunchbreaks … It’s prevalent in our senior schools. I think it’s a big issue and we need an education campaign hence the parliamentary inquiry and hopefully health professionals talk there about the harmful consequences of vaping. It’s almost like the next smoking wave. The problem of how the next generation became hooked on vaping has been the subject of a major investigation by Guardian Australia’s medical editor Melissa Davey at the end of last year. Senator Tammy Tyrrell says she is ‘not a professional politician’ The Jacqui Lambie Network senator, Tammy Tyrrell, has been one of the surprises of the new parliament. The Tasmanian senator, like Lambie, puts Tasmania at the centre of every decision, and while she hasn’t received a lot of attention so far (David Pocock and the Greens tend to act as the balance of power) she is rising in prominence. The Greens gave the government the numbers it needed for the national reconstruction fund last week, after the government agreed the fund could not be used for coal, gas or native forrest logging. Tyrrell released a letter Anthony Albanese had sent the Tasmanian logging industry in May last year, assuring it a Labor government wouldn’t hurt its interests, accusing the government of “betraying” the industry. The industry minister, Ed Husic, said that the agreement would not impact operations with Tasmanian native forestry logging and Tyrrell said she’s prepared to listen; We had a meeting with him as well. And we’ve asked for more detail. We’ve asked for the logic behind it. And he’s agreed to give it to us. So once he’s given us [that], I’ll be 100% cool with it … What he gave the Greens, it doesn’t sound like as much of anything … if it’s not going to do what they asked him to do. Tyrrell said it sounded to her as if the Greens didn’t secure anything. Well, in all honesty … I wouldn’t be really happy of all the negotiating that they’ve done, and they’ve really come out with nothing, but that’s what it looks like to me and I’m not a professional politician. So if I can see that they’ve actually won not a lot of anything that doesn’t really make a lot of sense. But Husic amazing. He’s going to send us some information so that I can be assured that Tasmanian industry and business isn’t going to be impacted. And that’s all I care about, really – is … people’s jobs and their living, how they’re gonna help their families keep a roof over their head and afford the cost of living. That’s what’s important to me and industry being kept here in Tassie and Australia. Husic said the fund was never going to be used for coal, gas or logging so it wasn’t an issue. The Greens said they wanted the agreement to ensure that future governments couldn’t use the fund to hold up those industries (like what happened with the clean energy fund while the Coalition was in power) NSW premier says lack of former Liberal leaders at campaign launch due to being ‘focused on the future’ Perrottet is being pressed on why the federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, wasn’t at the NSW Liberal campaign launch yesterday. Apparently Perrottet decided to have John Howard as the only former PM in attendance because he is “focused on the future”. Michael Rowland: You had your campaign yesterday. You’re the last remaining mainland Liberal government. Where was Peter Dutton? Perrottet: The only leader we had there was John Howard. He’s obviously a great in the Liberal Party. Rowland: Why not the current Liberal leader? Perrottet: This is a New South Wales election. It’s on New South Wales issues. I’m the premier. We did haven’t any former Liberal premiers or former prime ministers outside of John Howard. Rowland: There’s been federal Liberal leaders who have attended the 2019 and 2015 Liberal party launches. Perrottet: Well, I wanted John Howard there. I’m focused on the future. So, that’s the reason we made that decision. Ultimately it’s about our policies for the great people of New South Wales and to take the state forward. I’m not concerned about attendees, I’m concerned about our policies – that’s my focus, not personalities. Perrottet grilled on future fund’s potential to skew in favour of wealthy families The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, is speaking to ABC News about this future fund for the state’s children. Breakfast host Michael Rowland is pressing the premier on the fact that the scheme favours wealthy families with the government contribution each year only matching what families can put in after the initial kickstarting the account. Perrottet: Parents across New South Wales will be able to go through our Services Australia app, set up an account for their child. We will put in $400 to kickstart the account. We will match contributions each year up to $400. That would mean by the time that a child turns 18, they will have to up to $49,000 in their account which they can draw down on for the costs of education, and also for housing. So, this is about making sure we give our kids the best opportunities and head start in life and if I think of something like this could have been put in 18 years ago, so many children would have had the help with early expenses. Rowland: Parents can contribute up to $1,000 – $400 – if they had the money up to $1,000. Doesn’t this unnecessarily favour wealthy families? Not every family will be able to contribute anywhere near $400. Perrottet: As part of this if a family is on Family Tax Benefit, we will contribute each year $200 without a co-contribution being required. Rowland: The point stands, it does skew to wealthy parents who by definition have the money to pay up to $1,000? Perrottet: We capped it at $1,000. This is about giving every child that great opportunity. For those families, who are low to middle income earners, they will get an automatic $200 without having to make a co-contribution. For those who aren’t on Family Tax Benefits, we will make up to $400 contributions as well. So, on the basis that that is also met by the parents. This is all about encouraging mums and dads across NSW to save for their children and to look to the future. We can get caught up in the day-to-day and the pressures. This is about ensuring we put downward pressure on household budgets – but what is our responsibility? That is to set up our kids for future success. Tyrrell ‘uncertain’ on support for voice Tammy Tyrrell says she believes the government shouldn’t be funding the yes and no campaigns in the upcoming referendum on the Indigenous voice to parliament. The machinery provisions around the referendum will probably come before the Senate next week. The opposition voted no in the house after the government conceded to information pamphlets, but not money, for the yes and no campaigns. I think that the AEC should have control of the information … I have faith in the AEC that they are equal and fair. And I believe that both sides of the argument should have correct information and not lean one way or the other. I think everybody deserves to have a vote. And they need to be well informed. I don’t want anybody to go, ‘I voted yes. And that’s not what I’ve gotten. That’s not what you promised me.’ I don’t want there to be false advertising. … I don’t believe that the government should fund yes or no campaigns. I believe that they should fund one document that gives both sides of the argument. On her support for the referendum itself, Tyrrell says she believes in recognition but isn’t willing to go as far as say she believes the voice should be enshrined in the constitution. I’m in favour of Australia as a whole going to referendum and putting their two cents worth in. I believe that we should have recognition. I believe that this is important, but I’m worried that the country as a whole aren’t going to take it seriously. And aren’t going to take the vote seriously and make sure that they’re heard. That’s my biggest fear: that it’s going to land one way or the other and it’s because people aren’t being informed and they’re not taking their vote seriously. … But my personal vote, I’m still a little bit uncertain. Circling back to the interview with Tammy Tyrrell. Tyrrell wants to see the government invest at least 4% of its multibillion-dollar social housing plan in Tasmania. She says it’s only fair, as a government survey shows 4.6% of people most in need of housing support are in Tasmania. Tyrrell says she will be meeting next week with the housing minister, Julie Collins, about the request. They haven’t shut me down. They haven’t said no, but they haven’t said yes. Good morning from Canberra – it is a public holiday in Canberra today (for Canberra day) but the work doesn’t stop, so here we are. But before we get to the politics, a little announcement – Penny Wong and Dr Helen Haines have been awarded the 2022 McKinnon prize for political leadership. Wong, who also won in 2018, became the first recipient to win twice. The judges, which included former Liberal MP Kelly O’Dwyer and former senior public servant Martin Parkinson, awarded Wong the 2022 McKinnon political leader of the year for “her swift and demonstrable progress in resetting Australia’s foreign policy agenda and in working respectfully to enhance important bilateral relationships in a challenging geopolitical environment”. Haines won the emerging political leader of the year award for her tireless advocacy for integrity in politics, as well as “her dedication to serving her electorate and connecting her constituency to her national policy work, including her commitment to the Beechwood principles for integrity”. Haines told ABC News Breakfast her commitment to her electorate was what guided her. It’s absolutely fundamental to everything that I do. My job is to represent the people of Indi in the federal parliament and in doing that, I try my darnedest to connect policy to the people to the policy, every single time. So I go to them when I have to make a decision about a piece of legislation I may not be clear on. And I go to them and explain why I’ve made the decision I have once that legislation is through the parliament. A man has fired several shots at police vehicles in a Townsville suburb. Residents have been told not to leave their homes during the siege. Queensland police declared an emergency about 9pm on Sunday for an area of Kirwan bordered by Dalrymple Rd, Kern Brothers Dr, Sandstone Dr and Golf Links Dr. The emergency declaration followed earlier reports a man armed with a gun was alone in a home in Elphinstone Dr. Police said the man reportedly fired several shots, hitting responding officers’ vehicles. Residents within the exclusion zone were urged to stay inside their properties and lock their doors. Police said they were still conducting emergency operations in the area on Monday morning and asked people and aircraft to avoid the zone. - AAP Australian industry needs ‘carve-out’ in safeguard mechanism, says Tammy Tyrrell On the safeguard mechanism, Tyrrell says she wants Australian industry to be “cleaner and greener” but she doesn’t want to see industries having to shut down because they can’t meet the demands. We agree that we need to be cleaner and greener but there’s industries that we need for manufacturing and jobs and incomes here in Australia that are going to struggle to do what they’re asking upfront. Concrete, steel, metals, we need them in Australia to build business industry. So they are going to need a little bit of a carve-out so that they can become as clean and green as they can moving forward. But there’s no way I want them shutting down when this legislation gets through the government. We need to take them into account. What are we going to do if they shut down tomorrow? How are we going to build anything? RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas points out under the legislation they will get unlimited carbon credits. But Tyrrell has concerns around the cost of those credits: I’d rather them buy carbon credits here in Australia rather than going overseas. There’s a company here in Tasmania called LMS energy. They’re actually drilling old tips like refuse tips and they’re harvesting methane and they’re 100% utilising the energy that they produce, and they sell clean carbon credits. I’d rather that they sell their carbon credit at a reasonable price here in Australia rather than buying carbon credits from overseas. … If they make them too expensive, people aren’t going to buy them here and businesses are going to go to the wall that are selling the credits like LMS energy. And if they’re too cheap, they might as well just give them away. Tyrrell says Ed Husic has been “very kind” talking to her and Jacqui Lambie and she says “we’re not finished talking to him yet”. Greens deal on reconstruction fund ‘not much of anything,’ Tyrrell says Tammy Tyrrell, senator for the Jacqui Lambie Network, is speaking with ABC Radio after accusing the government on betraying Tasmanian logging through their deal with the Greens on the $15bn reconstruction fund. The bill passed the lower house on Thursday after a deal was struck with the Greens, amending the legislation to prevent the fund being used to invest in coal and gas projects, or log native forests. Ed Husic, the industry minister, told ABC Radio on Friday the deal wouldn’t affect the logging industry, as logging would continue to take place where states and territories allowed it. Tyrrell says she has met with Husic, and once she gets a few more details she’ll be “100% cool” with the reconstruction fund. However, she points out whatever agreement the minister made with the Greens “doesn’t sound as if it’s much of anything if it’s not going to do what they asked him to do”. I wouldn’t be really happy if all the negotiating that they’ve done and they’ve really come out with nothing. That’s that’s what it looks like to me and I’m not a professional politician. So if I can see that they’ve actually won not a lot of anything it doesn’t really make a lot of sense. Chalmers says government ‘closely monitoring’ fallout from US bank collapse The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says the government is seeking advice about the potential impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the biggest failure of a US bank since the global financial crisis. Australian shares, particularly the big four commercial banks and Macquarie Bank, are expected to extend Friday’s falls when trading resumes this morning. SVB reportedly held $US200bn ($A302bn) in assets at the end of last year and was itself valued at $US40bn in 2022. It was seized by US federal regulators on Friday after its effort to raise capital failed and depositors – many of them Silicon Valley start-ups – rushed to pull their money out. Chalmers said in a statement: We are closely monitoring the situation and potential impacts for Australia caused by the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank in the US. In seeking preliminary advice we are aware that some Australian firms have been impacted and we’re working closely with our regulators as well as the tech sector to better understand the implications for the industry as the situation evolves. Australians should be reassured that our institutions are solid, our banking sector is well-capitalised, and we’re in a better position than most other nations to deal with the challenges we face in the global economy. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said over the weekend she had “full confidence in banking regulators to take appropriate actions in response,” adding that regulators “have effective tools” to address the bank’s failure, Bloomberg reported. Investors piled into US treasuries at the end of last week, sending the yield on two-year bonds plunging the most in any two days since the global crisis in 2008. US bank stocks registered their biggest weekly fall since the start of the Covid pandemic in 2020, Bloomberg said. The New South Wales Greens will today unveil its reproductive health policy platform ahead of the 25 March poll. It will include the establishment of a statewide directory of contraception and abortion providers and free period products in all public toilets and schools. All public hospitals would also be made to provide abortions and funding to women’s health centres across the state would be boosted. The plan also includes the provision of a midwife and backup midwife for all parents during pregnancy and birth and the introduction of midwifery staffing ratios. Greens upper house candidate Dr Amanda Cohn said she had experience as a GP looking after patients “who have had to shop around to find an abortion service” and it needed to change: Reproductive health care is health care and should be available through public health services. This is about enabling choice and supporting and empowering people making the significant decision to become a parent or not. The Greens' women’s rights spokesperson, Jenny Leong, said: It is critical we make sure our public healthcare system is able to deliver reproductive healthcare and abortions without political interference. The Greens are proudly pro-choice – every vote, every MP, every time. Disaster funding and loans made available as floods cause ‘significant damage’ The Queensland emergency services minister, Mark Ryan, said there was extensive damage in the state’s north-west after daily rainfall reached more than 300mm. This has caused significant damage to road infrastructure, with large washouts and ground saturation triggering the closure of a number of roads. On Sunday, the federal and state governments announced more disaster funding, including payments for Urandangi residents of up to $180 for individuals or $900 for families to cover personal essentials. In Burke, Carpentaria, Cloncurry, Doomadgee, Mornington and Mount Isa, loans of up to $250,000 are being made available for affected small businesses and primary producers. The emergency management minister, Murray Watt, said in a statement: This weather event has been impacting Queensland for several months, and as conditions escalate, we’re working with the Queensland government to ensure appropriate levels of community assistance are available. More rain forecast for north-west Queensland could elevate already record water levels as residents in the south-east clean up after a wave of thunderstorms, AAP reports. A man was hospitalised in a critical condition after he was struck by lightning at Brendale, north of Brisbane, on Sunday afternoon as thunderstorms rolled across the south-east. In the north-west, an extended period of extreme rain led to almost 100 residents being evacuated in remote Burketown after river levels exceeded seven metres, surpassing the 2011 record of 6.78 metres. Thirty-seven houses had power disconnected as they were inundated in flood waters, while about 70 residents remained in the area with limited electricity and water supplies. Burke Shire mayor, Ernie Camp, said water levels had dropped on Sunday night, bringing some positive news for the flood-ravaged region. He told Seven’s Sunrise program: We do live in a quite extreme part of Australia. The flooding event has broken all records … the First Nations people no doubt would have seen something much higher than this, but certainly in living memory it’s the highest we’ve seen. Severe flooding is continuing along the Gregory, Nicholson and Leichhardt river catchments, which recorded up to 35mm of rain in the 24 hours to Sunday morning. A major flood warning is also active in the lower Flinders and Cloncurry rivers. The Gregory River peaked at 12.3 metres and was falling this morning, although it remained at major flood level. With more showers and isolated thunderstorms forecast for the state’s northwest, emergency services expect peak flooding to continue. Scattered thunderstorms were also expected in southeast Queensland today after heavy rain hit much of the region on Sunday afternoon. About 70mm of rain fell in an hour at Imbil, south of Gympie, while 67mm was recorded in Samford near Brisbane. The Bureau of Meteorology said there was a chance of severe thunderstorms between Mackay and the Sunshine Coast, and in the northern interior, today. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has flown into California where he will meet with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, today, ahead of unveiling the pathway for the Aukus submarine partnership tomorrow. Albanese and Sunak, alongside the US president, Joe Biden, are set to announce the deal which is expected to see Australia buy at least three Virginia class submarines in San Diego on Monday local time. The Albanese government is expected to announce the plan will create and support about 20,000 jobs over the next three decades across the nation’s industry, defence force, and public service. In Queensland, historic flooding in the north-west of the state is likely to continue with more rain forecast, after almost 100 residents were evacuated from remote Burketown. An exclusion zone remains in place in Townsville as police are responding to reports of shots fired in this area. In NSW, the Labor leader, Chris Minns, has ruled out future funds for children after the premier, Dominic Perrottet, used the Liberal campaign launch to pledge up to $400 annually for children to be used on education or housing after turning 18. Circling back to the US where we began this post, the 95th Academy Awards will be taking place in LA. Cate Blanchett, nominated for best actress in Tár, and Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis, nominated for best picture and several other nominations, will be carrying Australia’s Oscar hopes. Let’s get into it!"

                    "bodyText": "Australia will need to significantly scale up local nuclear education and training to build sufficient expertise for the multi-decade Aukus submarine plan, experts say. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is expected to unveil the plan on Tuesday morning AEDT, with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the US president, Joe Biden. The Australian government estimates that Aukus will support 20,000 jobs over 30 years, across the Australian Defence Force, the public service and private industry. It poses a looming challenge to educate, train and recruit the necessary personnel, but experts say Australia has a good base from which to expand its nuclear industry. Dr Patrick Burr, a senior lecturer in nuclear engineering at the University of New South Wales, said “we definitely have a healthy nuclear industry in Australia, but it’s often overlooked”, citing nuclear safeguards and research into nuclear materials, nuclear medicine and waste. “On the other hand … it needs to grow manyfold.” Prof Gregory Lane, who convenes the master of nuclear science program at the Australian National University, agrees. “There’s a lot of knowledge about nuclear science. It’s required in all sorts of different areas: mining, health, sterilisation of materials for general industry, industrial gauging.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup UNSW administers the only nuclear engineering degrees in the country, while the ANU is the only one to educate students in nuclear science. “The skills are available in Australia but there are specifics of [Aukus] that we’ve never had to deal with and they’re going to have to be developed over time,” Lane said, adding: “Fundamentally, we don’t have a nuclear power program in Australia.” The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto), a government agency, runs a nuclear research reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney. Lane describes the Ansto reactor as “one of the most technologically advanced reactors of its type”, which produces neutrons for experiments and to make medical isotopes. “But that’s a very different beast to a reactor that is used for power and then a reactor that you’re going put under water and needs to be absolutely failsafe.” Burr and Lane agree that some nuclear personnel will need to be trained overseas. V Adm Jonathan Mead confirmed last week that some Royal Australian Navy officers were completing a nuclear reactor course in the US and also enrolled in UNSW and ANU programs. Burr said UNSW had about 125 graduates each year across its undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, while Lane said more than 20 students were currently enrolled in the ANU master’s program. For the nuclear-powered submarines, “suitably qualified and experienced personnel” will be required at three tiers of expertise, Burr said. The first tier are those who are “nuclear aware”, which would require only several months of training, Burr said. “In a nuclear submarine … even something as simple as welding a pipe needs to be done by a nuclear-aware welder” – someone with additional training about the implications of working with nuclear-grade materials. “If the weld goes wrong while you’re at sea, it could be catastrophic.” The second tier are people who “have somewhere between five and 10 years of experience, and they typically have an education in engineering as well”. The third tier, requiring the most expertise, are those with 20 to 30 years’ experience and a PhD at a minimum. UNSW modelling, led by Dr Edward Obbard, forecasts that operating and maintaining eight nuclear-propelled submarines would directly require several thousand tier 1 personnel, about 2,500 people at tier 2 and about 200 tier 3 subject matter experts. Experts say scaling up local nuclear capabilities will require national coordination. “This needs to be a coordinated, collaborative effort from all nuclear training and education institutions in Australia,” Burr said. “Ansto will have a crucial role to play, not in education, but in some level of training and some level of government advisory.” Lane said: “We need to be looking at regulation, law, engineering, strategic studies, health – all of these things matter in supporting a nuclear submarine effort.” Ansto declined to comment."

                    "headline": "Long shadow of US invasion of Iraq still looms over international order",
                    "bodyText": "The French statesman Georges Clemenceau once said: “War is a series of catastrophes that results in a victory.” In the case of the invasion of Iraq, however, the war that began 20 years ago started in victory and has ended in a series of catastrophes. The main US military pullout from Iraq was ultimately completed by 2011, finally answering the question posed by Gen David Petraeus during that first push to Baghdad in 2003: “Tell me, how does this end?” Yet the long shadow of the invasion still looms over the international order, staining the reputation of those who instigated it and the political process itself, and dealing a heavy blow to the self-confidence that the west felt in the years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. At this distance, on the eve of the twentieth anniversary on 20 March, it seems to matter less whether the war was launched on a deceit, a distortion, a wilful misapprehension, or a sincere false premise. It was a blunder that looks worse with every passing anniversary and memoir. Barack Obama drew one lesson from the episode: “Don’t do stupid shit.” The question in the title of Baroness Ashton’s new book on diplomacy, And Then What?, was asked by many in relation to Iraq before the invasion. The risky consequences for Iraq were spelt out in memos and meetings at the time by Iraq experts in Britain such as Rosemary Hollis and Toby Dodge and by innumerable US Middle East specialists, including the current CIA chief, Bill Burns, but those who mattered, including the notably incurious George Bush, chose to ignore the warnings. Dodge, freshly back from Iraq, was even invited to Downing Street to warn Blair that the invasion would be a disaster. He recalls Blair saying to him at the outset: “I know you think I should not do it, but I have to. I know it’s going to be bad. Tell me how bad it’s going to be”. Dodge explained: “In London and Washington, there was no one who had the first idea about Iraq, but they were planning to occupy it and run the place. It was hubris of the highest order.” The breathtaking mishandling of the biggest attempt at liberal interventionism since Vietnam is now acknowledged by almost all those involved. As looting swept the capital and the institutions of the dictatorship were dismantled by the new occupiers, the US official designated to oversee the ministry of trade, Robin Raphel, walked the streets of Baghdad with an interpreter, asking: “Do you know anybody who is in the ministry of trade?” The chaos has spawned a vast literature on post-conflict planning, and multi-volume official inquiries, notably the Chilcot inquiry in the UK and a two-volume report by the US army. “We have all over the past 20 years sifted through and tried to read the runes about what was the big mistake. Some things accelerated the collapse, such as the legacy of sanctions or de-Baathification,” Dodge said. “But the big mistake, the original sin, was to invade a country you know nothing about with a bunch of exiles that had not been there for 20 years. It was destined for failure. Full stop.” The aftermath and aftershocks of the war are so pervasive that the only risk is that a line of causality is drawn from the invasion to almost every major global event in the past 20 years. Disentangling what can be legitimately traced back to the “original sin” of the invasion and what may have other origins is no easy task. It is largely uncontentious that ending Saddam’s 24 years in power, with no agreed coherent plan for who or what was to replace him, reawakened a sectarian Shia-Sunni competition for supremacy across the Middle East. It prompted first an insurgency by displaced Sunnis within Iraq, the birth of what would become Islamic State, and then in the chaos of the Syrian civil war, the emergence of the group’s self-proclaimed caliphate across Syria and Iraq in 2011. The war strengthened Iran and its proxies across the Middle East, and then, as the bloodshed continued, created in the west a wariness about military intervention that was to help the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, survive an armed rebellion and give Vladimir Putin an unexpected re-entry ticket to the Middle East. If other Arab leaders needed a reason to suppress the threat posed by the Arab Spring in 2011, the chaos of democracy in Iraq gave them that excuse. The unilateral US withdrawal from Afghanistan, instigated by Donald Trump and then pursued by his successor, Joe Biden, was born of an exasperation with the failure of nation-building exemplified by Iraq. The line of causality also extends to the shredding of the developing doctrine that sovereignty should not be considered inviolate when a country is slaughtering its own citizens. The reputation of intelligence agencies is only now recovering. Brown University’s Costs of War Project estimates that the taxpayer bill for post-9/11 US wars reached $8tn, representing a profound diversion from civilian spending. About 400,000 Iraqis died. Even now, the invasion has a sharp contemporary relevance, with a western wariness about regime change in Tehran, let alone Moscow. “Change to what and by what means?” asked the French president, Emmanuel Macron, at last month’s Munich security conference, knowing the unspoken reference to the succession of corrupt and sectarian governments in Iraq post-2003 was warning enough against inducing regime change in Russia. When the US rightly denounces Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and extols the sacrosanct virtues of national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the UN charter, it only takes seconds for China and Russia, along with a distrustful global south, to point to the example of Iraq and accuse the US of double standards. “Countries have memories,” Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, recently conceded. Indeed, Dr Patricia Lewis of the Chatham House thinktank argues that US policy in Iraq has already become such fertile propaganda territory for Russia that it would be better for the US to get out there first with a mea culpa. “Decisions were made on the basis of false information, and it is best to be open about that so the impact of Russian disinformation is minimised,” she said. The invasion certainly had a profound immediate impact on Vladimir Putin, at the time only three years into his first term as president. American unilateralism in Iraq was critical in convincing Putin, initially an ally in Bush’s war on terror, of what he saw as the irredeemable arrogance of the US. Blair’s press secretary, Alastair Campbell, in his diaries captures the confrontation between Putin and Blair at a press conference in May 2003, and how it spilled over into the dinner afterwards: “This was someone who felt he ought to be treated as an equal and was not being treated as an equal. He said the whole post-9/11 response was designed to show off American greatness.” The US was demanding that Russia acquiesce to a unipolar world in which it was accountable to no one. As Blair started his justification, Putin interjected: “Don’t answer. There is no answer. That is the truth. There are bad people in the administration, Tony, and you know it.” From Putin’s perspective, everything the US did subsequently – including flirting with Islamists during the Arab Spring, misleading him over UN authorisation for the toppling of Gaddafi in Libya, siding with groups that included jihadists against Assad’s Syria and support for Ukraine’s 2014 Maidan protests – were signs of a country that saw no distinction between a “rules-based order” and American hegemony. The Saudis, the US’s long-term ally in the region, also felt betrayed by the invasion, since it had warned Bush of the risks of suddenly importing democracy to Iraq. Riyadh not only did not favour elections in principle, it especially did not favour them when a Shia majority would mean that any elections would naturally turn out in their favour, as they duly did in 2005. Saud al Faisal, the kingdom’s foreign minister for 40 years, complained afterwards that the US had “effectively handed Iraq to Iran on a silver platter”. The Gulf monarchies complained that the west had created a hostile Iranian-Syrian axis, also known as the Hezbollah-Iraq-Syria-Hamas (Hish) alliance, that was later to further tie down the Saudis in Yemen. Iran, delighted to see its old foe Saddam toppled, was quick to exploit the power vacuum in Baghdad and eventually built a whole foreign policy on its success. Hamidreza Azizi, visiting fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, says the 2003 invasion “drastically changed Iran’s threat perception”, where its leaders saw proof of Washington’s desire to embark on a strategy of active interventions. “The most immediate impact was that support for non-state-armed actors came to form a central feature in Iran’s military strategy,” he said. “Since 2003, the main objective of Iran’s security assistance has been to extend the country’s strategic depth through building and protecting this ‘axis of resistance.’” In Iraq, it gained influence through groups such as Jaish al-Mahdi, the militia affiliated with Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, and once the Quds force, the foreign policy arm of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, was established inside Iraq, it built a personal network, often in the process overruling Iran’s ministry of foreign affairs. The Pentagon was later to claim that more than 600 of the 4,000 US soldiers killed in Iraq were felled by Iranian-backed terror groups. It assessed that within two years of the 2005 elections, Iran proxies effectively controlled two-thirds of the council of representative seats in Iraq. It is often said that the sectarian violence that engulfed Iraq following the removal of the Sunnis from power was inevitable. It is true that following the ending of the Sunni minority rule, there was an immediate reassertion of Shia identity, symbolised at the end of April 2003 when over 2 million Shias, many crossing over the Iranian border, marched on the holy city of Karbala in a pilgrimage that the Saddam regime had banned. It was also natural when they were given the chance to vote in 2005 that they gravitated to what they knew. But it was not necessary for Iraq’s government to have behaved in such a sectarian way after the 2005 elections. The US had handpicked Nour al-Maliki to be prime minister in 2006 in the belief that he would not act in a sectarian or excessively pro-Iranian way. Before the fall of Saddam, Maliki had lived in exile in Iran, but he left, objecting to Iranian coercion and a demand that he swear allegiance to Ayatollah Khomenei. Once prime minister, he chose to make Sunni Saudi Arabia the venue for his first official foreign visit in a bid to cement Iraq’s place in the Arab world. According to A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy, a book by the former US intelligence officer and adjunct assistant professor at Georgetown University Katherine Harvey, Maliki, encouraged by the US, genuinely wanted a positive relationship with Saudi Arabia, and to pursue a course independent of Iran. But the July 2006 meeting between Maliki and King Abdullah was the only one the two men had, and in her account it was the choice of the Saudi monarch to cut himself off from the Iraqi PM, describing him as “an untrusted Iranian agent”. Yet as late as spring 2008, Maliki initiated confrontation with Iranian-backed Shia militias in Basra and Baghdad, and the success of these campaigns was seen as a setback for Iran. But as relations with the Saudis slowly deteriorated, and Maliki did not do as well as he hoped in the 2010 elections, he found himself ever more dependent on Tehran to stay in power. The psychological effect of the rise of a Shia-dominated government with ties to Iran inevitably shook the Saudi royal family, already weakened by the fall out from Saudi citizens’ involvement in 9/11. Obama’s decision to reduce US engagement in the Middle East only made Saudi unease worse. That American disengagement took many twists and turns, but the decisive point came when the west, haunted by the shadow of the Iraq war, refused to punish Syria in 2013 after Assad used chemical weapons against rebel groups, crossing Obama’s stated red line. First the British parliament, then Angela Merkel and finally the US Congress rejected military action. Obama was determined not to repeat the disastrous overreach of Iraq and pulled back from striking at Assad. Former French ambassador to Syria Michel Duclos, reflecting French thinking, argues that the Syrian revolution was salvageable at that point. “It would have been a strong signal that would have changed the situation because, at the time, the moderate opposition was still powerful, the jihadists on the sidelines, Iran awaiting the nuclear agreement and Vladimir Putin hesitant,” he said. But Obama read it differently. He decided that the price of action was higher than inaction. The effective impunity granted to Assad was a salutary moment for Riyadh. The Saudi ambassador to the UK, Mohammed bin Nawaf, attacked “the west’s excuses for inaction and hesitation”. Riyadh, he said, would have to go it alone, intensifying its proxy war with Iran by arming and trying to coordinate a wider ideological range of Islamist rebels in Syria. Bush himself was ambivalent about his motives in Iraq, reflecting the administration’s divisions. He initially cast the US response to 9/11 primarily in terms of making America safe from terrorists, and suggested Saddam was arming those terrorists. But by August 2002, Bush signed off a classified document penned by the US national security adviser, Condoleeza Rice, suggesting that the US could act as a midwife to a new Iraq whose society would be based on democracy and be a model of good governance for the region. In his new account of the administration’s deliberations on the war, Confronting Saddam, Melvyn P Leffler, emeritus professor of American history at the University of Virginia, argues that the Pentagon and the military had no true interest in this agenda, but democracy promotion became a useful alibi once no WMDs were found. By the time of his second inaugural address in January 2005, Bush had turned democracy into a major part of the war on terror. “The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands […] The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world. America’s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one.” Rice pursued the theme in a speech in Cairo in June 2005: “For 60 years, my country, the United States, pursued stability at the expense of democracy in this region here in the Middle East, and we achieved neither. Now we are taking a different course. We are supporting the democratic aspirations of all people.” The Bush government identified civil society organisations, including even briefly the Muslim Brotherhood, and financially supported NGOs through its “democracy promotion” agenda. But if anything, the Iraq war acted as a brake on the spread of democracy. The Gulf monarchies breathed a sigh of relief that the region’s premier democratic experiment was nobody’s poster child and polls showed that massive majorities in the Middle East opposed the US invasion. As Burns admitted: “The debacle in Iraq, including the miserable images from Abu Ghraib, poisoned America’s image and credibility. If this was how America promotes democracy, few Arabs wanted any part of it.” When the Arab Spring uprisings occurred in 2011-12, it was little to do with American inspiration and much more to do with youth unemployment, corruption, Qatar’s sponsoring of the Muslim Brotherhood and the rise of a new media landscape. “Many of the movements were not seeking to replicate a prevalent neoliberal world order, but something different,” argues Iyad el-Baghdadi in The Middle East Crisis Factory. Obama disliked the Gulf monarchies, but when the democratically elected Mohamed Morsi was ousted by the Egyptian army in 2013, Obama prevaricated before choosing not to describe it as a coup. The fact that that China and not the US negotiated last week’s Saudi-Iran reconciliation agreement is seen as a further a sign of diminished American influence in the region. What of Iraq itself? Iraq’s current president, Abdul Latif Rashid, a Kurd, urged the world recently not to see Iraq as a war zone and insisted it was better to have freedom and democracy than repression. Baghdad-based Marsin Alshamary of the Brookings Institute says there “is now a passionate turn against the sectarian lens that was imposed on Iraq” and reflected in the way the government was structured after 2003. The 2019 Tishreen uprising marked a reconciliation between Shia and Sunni youth, she says, brought together in a revolt against the corruption of the entire ruling class. A key target was the political system built on Muhasasa Ta’ifia, an ethnic-sectarian apportionment of the spoils, developed by Iraqi exiles in the 1990s with the help of the UK Foreign Office. It is seen as a key source of Iraq’s instability by institutionalising sectarianism in politics. The uprising led to the resignation of the prime minister, some changes to the electoral law giving greater space to independents, and parliamentary elections in 2021, the fifth since 2003. But the changes envisaged in 2019 were not achieved. It took 382 days to form a governing coalition, and the undisputed winners were Iranian-backed parties. Alshamary warns of a disillusionment and even a nostalgia for a strong state. She points out that most Iraqis were born after Saddam’s fall and their memory of Baathism comes from their families or social media. At the end of the day, Iraqi youth are in the same place as a lot of youth in the Middle East. “They thought democracy would produce socioeconomic rights, and when it failed to do so, their attachment to democracy has loosened.” It is not the glorious legacy that those who started the invasion envisaged."

                    "bodyText": "Vlad Beliavsky hoped to bring some peace to the world with his first book, The Pyramid Mind. If we all trained our minds properly, he thought, we could live together in harmony. At best, he imagined his book might even stop wars. Today, he is in Kyiv, wearing military uniform and silhouetted against a neutral background. It is safer not to give details of where; he simply says he is in a military building. As his book is published, 13 years after it was conceived, Lieutenant Beliavsky is marking a year spent fighting for the future of Ukraine. He is a handsome, youthful 33-year-old. In other circumstances you could imagine him in a boyband or becoming the Brian Cox of psychology. But look closely, and there are heavy bags beneath his eyes. His skin is pallid. He talks slowly, measuring his words with scrupulous care. At times, he seems on the verge of tears. You look exhausted, I say. He smiles. “I’ve been in the army for a year, and we don’t have breaks or weekends. We just serve.” But he’s one of the lucky ones, he says. “I’m not on the frontline at the moment. I’m not deprived of sleep as I was in March and April last year.” Back then, he was defending a besieged Kyiv. “It was madness. We slept for only three hours a night.” He is now working in the cybersecurity team. What is life like? “Tough. But we are coping. It’s really hard here. I never thought a war of such intensity would take place again in Europe. It’s not a pleasant experience.” Beliavsky, I realise, is a master of understatement. Until he joined the army, he had always considered himself a pacifist. “I was more horrified at the thought of taking lives than being killed. Life is a gift, and we need to protect it. I always felt my mission was to help people develop this life, to grow, so we could be healthier, more productive, happier.” Not surprisingly, the start of the war caused an existential crisis. He wavered a few weeks before signing up. To go to war was a betrayal of his values. But not to go to war would have been a still bigger betrayal. “There was no other option. The smartest people in the world tried to negotiate with Russia and failed. I came to believe that in some cases you just need to stand up and fight back. Otherwise they would come and destroy everything. And I couldn’t let that happen. I thought if I stood aside, I’d never feel OK with myself in the future.” There is a quiet intensity to everything Beliavsky says. For all his conviction, he seems to be a man still coming to terms with a shattered belief system. Beliavsky grew up in Ukraine with a father who worked in commerce and a mother who worked in marketing. Fascinated by history, as a teenager he would sit with his father discussing the rise and fall of civilisations. Mad and bad dictators were a recurrent theme. At university in Kyiv, he studied international relations, and that’s where he came across Seneca’s writing on stoicism. “This book was written 2,000 years ago and it was speaking to me. That was the first time I understood the power of literature. There could be another guy in 100 years who reads your book and if it has value it could influence him. That’s great!” After an internship at the Ukrainian embassy in Kazakhstan, he worked for a year in international relations at the State Savings Bank of Ukraine. He hoped to become a diplomat. “I thought it was a means to reconcile people; to establish peace. Then I understood that peace comes from within.” He started to believe that conflict had to be treated at its source: by the time the stage of diplomacy is reached, it is often too late. He became more interested in psychology as a route to peace. “I thought, if we know how to reach internal harmony, we’ll know how to create harmony around ourselves. Because if I feel good about myself there is little chance I would start a war or suppress anybody.” In 2014, he began researching psychology and philosophy at Warwick University in the UK, studying for a PhD while continuing to work on his book. The more he studied, the more he realised he had work to do on himself. “I understood that I was messed up as well. I needed tools to fix myself.” In what way? “I didn’t know how to cope with negative emotions.” The Pyramid Mind is Beliavsky’s attempt to fix himself and the rest of us. He describes the book as a “mind management model” that explains how the mind is organised, how it works, and how best to nurture it. Part textbook, part self-help manual, it includes lots of practical advice. Rather than dedicating himself to one school of thought, Beliavsky is an integrative psychologist, uniting traditional medicine, psychology, alternative and complementary approaches. He is also a mixed martial arts expert. At the age of 19, he started learning aikido. “I asked our sensei why we were learning great techniques but ignoring others. Let’s diversify our skillset, I said, but those schools are very rigid.” So he started practising other martial arts away from the aikido class. “I felt as if I was cheating on my tutors and coaches! I ended up doing MMA because I favour this curiosity. You become a well-rounded fighter and it’s harder to defeat you.” Hold on, I say, I thought you were a pacifist? That’s the point, he says – MMA helped him move beyond negative thoughts and made him less likely to have real fights. “Even though I practised martial arts, I never tried to prove dominance over people. If somebody tries to hurt me, I do anything to avoid verbal or physical conflict.” It is a philosophy he took to the frontline. Beliavsky returned to Kyiv from the UK during the pandemic. As an IT expert, he developed apps to improve mental health, while working on his book. When the writing was finished, he planned to go on a long surfing trip in Asia, but by then Russia had invaded Ukraine. Last March he joined the army as a lieutenant. How would he describe a typical day on the frontline? “You sleep little. Too little. Then you go to your checkpoint with your military unit and patrol your district. You communicate with other units and try to capture saboteurs and maintain order in the streets. If there is a suspicious group of people, you need to be ready to use rifles and start fighting. It was like an apocalypse movie because the streets were deserted.” What was it like for a pacifist to use a rifle? There is a long pause. “Well, luckily I didn’t have to use it very often, but still … I was asked this question almost a year ago by a friend who is an American sniper. I said I hoped I would wound a person but not kill them, so that we could interrogate them. So you’re determined to do your job, but to say you’re absolutely determined to take someone’s life … no.” He trails off. What did his sniper friend say? “He said he remembered almost everyone he killed. When I asked how he coped, he said he didn’t perceive those people as human beings and it helped him. It was a hard thing for me to accept.” Could he ever adopt that mentality? “No,” he says quietly. Did he manage to shoot people without killing them? “I hope I didn’t kill anybody.” He says he can’t be sure. “Things happened so fast that you just don’t see everything.” Has his psychology proved useful in a war setting? “Yes, it’s absolutely practical,” he says. Beliavsky spends his spare time supporting his comrades. “I tell people that I know psychotherapy and psychology, I’m here if you want to talk and I have a programme for you. I have little success with the older generation, but young soldiers come for advice.” Beliavsky says his sniper friend knew more about psychology than most. “He suffered from PTSD from the war in Afghanistan and he uses mindfulness techniques to stop flashbacks. He understood the nightmare of having trauma because of war and asked me what he could do to feel better.” Are many people in Ukraine traumatised? “Yep. Many.” Beliavsky stresses he’s not just talking about the military. Is he traumatised? “I hope not,” he eventually answers. “I sleep relatively well. I had a couple of nightmares during the first month. When a shopping mall in Kyiv was destroyed by a ballistic missile, we were nearby. It was a very frightening experience.” Has he lost friends? “Yes. I lost friends on the battlefield. Not many, but some of them I knew well. I lost three friends who I knew before the war. We talked together, went to pubs, and worked together for the same IT company. We enlisted at the same time. Luckily, I haven’t lost relatives.” Beliavsky says his psychology has helped him and others cope with fear. “Soldiers have a stereotype that if I feel fear, I’m weak. And I say, well, that’s bullshit. We all have emotions, including negative emotions, for a reason. We react fast when we face a life-threatening situation. We run faster, we become stronger, we feel fear but that’s OK. It helps us to fight the situation or to flee. Fear only becomes a problem when it paralyses you.” When was he most frightened? “On 4 March, the day I joined the army. I woke up at 4am and heard that there were battles at the nuclear power station in the south of Ukraine. Fire broke out and Russians were shelling the nuclear power plant. It was the most horrifying thing I’ve felt in my life, because if there was an explosion, it wasn’t just about Ukraine – the whole continent would be impacted. It’s the largest nuclear facility in Europe. If there was an explosion, there would be no life. There would be no place for peace, for raising children, for becoming better versions of ourselves.” He seems to be reliving the horror in front of me, and is momentarily overcome by hopelessness. “At times, I just don’t see a solution.” Then he snaps out of it. “I feel lucky I can help people with the skills I have, that I can teach them psychology and instil belief.” Beliavsky knows he can’t afford to despair. He spends a lot of time teaching fellow soldiers how to rewrite the stories they tell themselves. Understandably, many can only see negative endings. “One of our most negative stories is that we’re trapped, we’re losing our lives, so it’s a nasty time to live. I’m helping them to make tweaks to these stories so they can reshape the plot.” In The Pyramid Mind, Beliavsky says that the most contented people are realists rather than optimists or pessimists. So how does he tweak narratives to make them positive but realistic? “A friend of mine said he was afraid there would be no future in our country, even after the war ended. I said: ‘What is one good or constructive thing that has come out of the war?’ And he thought, and said: ‘Well, we have become stronger as a nation, we have a powerful army, and we have people we are proud of.’ I asked him: ‘Do you think if we manage to get through this nightmare period, this hell, these people would help you and our country to rebuild faster and would there be a brighter future for everybody?’ And he said: ‘Yes.’ So he created a new narrative.” As for Beliavsky’s future, he’s telling himself as many positive stories as possible. He hopes to find a partner, have children, work on a second book, create apps to help people with their mental health. Even now, he is working on apps to support people through the war. What has the war taught him about the mentality of Ukrainians? “I knew we were resilient, but I didn’t know how wonderful and strong our people are. You’ve got 40 million united Ukrainians, so what will Putin do? Will he massacre 40 million people? That’s the only way he can win this war. The only way.” One of his biggest concerns is that war robs his people of their humanity. “I see people changing because of the war. I see them becoming tougher, and I feel heartbroken because Ukrainians are extremely outgoing, friendly people. We need to protect our souls and minds.” Are Ukrainians becoming less kind? “It’s not that you become less kind, you just smile less often, joke less often. You see death every day and, as Nietzsche said, if you look at the darkness too long, the darkness also starts looking at you.” Does he think about the possibility of being killed? He nods. “I don’t find it very scary, to tell the truth. I mentioned stoicism, and one of the values I remind myself of almost every day is memento mori – we all die. The most important thing for me is the quality, not the length of life.” He talks to friends about the worst thing that can happen, and death is not top of the list. “You don’t want to be killed, but there are more terrifying things, like losing family and becoming disabled because of the attack. Many of my friends tell me that they hope it will be fast if it has to happen.” Actually, he says, if he were to die in the war, he would now feel he has made his mark on the world. “I wanted to create a book and it was the work of my life, and I was extremely happy that I finished it. When I joined the military, I thought: if I get killed, there is at least something that will keep living.” Has the war made him a better psychologist? Another pause. “I don’t know. Right now I am helping many more people than before the war. So I have much more practical experience.” Would he prefer to be a less good psychologist in a time of peace? “Yes,” he says, with a heartbreaking smile. • The Pyramid Mind by Vlad Beliavsky is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (£9.99).

Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s manic multiverse fantasy has dominated this year’s Oscars, winning best picture and six other awards, including for Michelle Yeoh, who became the first south-east Asian performer to win the best actress award. The most nominated film of the night also won best director, best supporting actor, best supporting actress, best editing and best original screenplay at the 95th Academy Awards ceremony. With Ke Huy Quan’s win for best supporting actor it was the first time multiple Asian actors won Oscars in the same year. In her acceptance speech, Yeoh called her win “a beacon of hope and possibility” for “all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight”. The ceremony began with host Jimmy Kimmel roasting Will Smith and ended with a screen showing the words: “Number of Oscars telecasts without incident: 001.” Here is the full list of winners, and you can look back at our blog to relive the action, including gems such as the Guardian’s Stuart Heritage declaring the night’s most viral moment – that time Hugh Grant compared his face to a scrotum. Top news Ralph Babet | The United Australia party senator has defended continuing to work for his family real estate business by claiming he is not paid. Babet said his job in the Senate still “takes priority” but that he was likely to return to real estate after one term in parliament because he did not see himself as a “career politician”. NSW politics | Premier Dominic Perrottet has denied removing senior minister Victor Dominello from the state’s gambling portfolio due to pressure from the powerful clubs lobby, saying he was “never under pressure” over the decision. Concern over lead testing | Community-led rainwater testing near the NSW town of Orange has found that one in three tanks have unsafe lead levels, which residents are concerned is linked to the Cadia goldmine. NSW Health is now retesting water samples to determine if there is a broader public health risk. Australian Ethical divests over koala concerns | One of Australia’s leading ethical investment managers says it has sold its shares in Lendlease over concerns a planned housing development in south-west Sydney threatens the survival of Sydney’s largest healthy koala population. Aukus | The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has declared “a new dawn for Australia’s defence policy” as he prepares to announce the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine plan tomorrow alongside Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak. Guardian Australia’s defence correspondent, Daniel Hurst, takes a look at the remaining unanswered questions. Plus, Prof John Blaxland on why Aukus will bolster stability in the Asia-Pacific, not undermine it. China | Xi Jinping has vowed to oppose Taiwan independence in his closing speech at the National People’s Congress, after a week in which the country’s rubber-stamp parliament handed China’s president an unprecedented third presidential term. He also called for greater economic self-reliance and the peaceful development of cross-strait relations with Taiwan. North Korea | The nuclear-armed country test-fired two strategic cruise missiles from a submarine on Sunday, its state news agency KCNA reported, just as the US and South Korea were due to kick off their largest joint military exercise in five years. US banking | US financial regulators rolled out emergency measures on Sunday night to stem potential contagion from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, including guaranteeing all deposits with the failed bank. Its collapse has shaken a tech sector already facing difficulties including unprecedented layoffs. Extreme weather | Another “atmospheric river” storm was expected to hit California on Monday, after thousands of residents were left without power following a weekend of heavy rainfall, powerful floods and deadly destruction. At least two people were killed by the recent storms while 9,400 were placed under evacuation orders. Full Story The teals, farmers and traditional owners fighting Santos The rich farmlands of NSW’s Liverpool Plains have long been coveted by fossil fuel companies – BHP and Chinese state-owned Shenhua have both tried and walked away. Now locals are preparing to fight Australian gas giant Santos, which holds the licences for what lies beneath. Rural and regional editor Gabrielle Chan tells Jane Lee about the new generation of farmers taking on Santos, alongside traditional owners and teal independent MPs.

                    "headline": "Aukus: 10 things we need to know about Australia’s nuclear submarine program",
                    "bodyText": "The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is preparing to make the most significant announcement since he took office, joining the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the US president, Joe Biden, to unveil the multi-decade Aukus submarine plan on Tuesday morning AEDT. For now, many questions remain unanswered. Here are some of the main ones to look out for on Tuesday. 1. How much will this cost? Will Australian taxpayers be on the hook to subsidise the expansion of the US production line? And how on earth will we pay for it all? None of this will be cheap. Previous non-government estimates have put the long-term submarine program cost at anywhere between $116bn and $171bn, although these numbers were crunched before the full details were known. In an interview with Guardian Australia in January, the defence minister, Richard Marles, also did not rule out Australian taxpayers subsidising the expansion of US production prior to South Australian shipbuilding being ready to ramp up domestic production. This all comes at a time when the Australian government’s budget is already under pressure from competing and growing demands on a range of fronts – and when the Coalition is opposing modest savings. 2. How will we build up the nuclear expertise and other associated jobs to make this project work? Will the Royal Australian Navy recruit the crews needed to operate these larger submarines? The government estimates that Aukus will support some 20,000 jobs – including in the Australian Defence Force, the public service and private industry – over 30 years. This is meant to sound like a big win for Australia, but it also underlines the huge challenge looming to educate, train and recruit the specialists needed to make the plan a success. The Royal Australian Navy is expected to launch a recruitment drive soon, but it comes against a backdrop of pre-existing challenges. In a briefing to Marles last year, obtained under freedom of information laws, Defence warned: “The last year has seen lower recruiting achievement and higher separation rates, which have resulted in the ADF and [Department of Defence] workforce size being below approved levels.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup 3. Will it add a layer of unnecessary complexity for Australia to potentially operate two different types of nuclear-powered submarines at once? The Guardian reported last week that the long-term Aukus plan would likely involve a British submarine design with heavy use of American technology. But as an answer to the potential capability gap caused by the retirement of Australia’s existing Collins class conventional submarines from the late 2030s, Reuters reported Australia would buy three Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines from the US in the 2030s (with an option to buy two more). Some analysts have argued it will create complexity, duplication and cost for Australia to potentially run two classes of nuclear-powered submarines at once, so the government will be pressed to explain how these challenges can be met. 4. What are the plans for sovereign control and for how long will US or UK personnel and advisers have to travel on board the subs? The government – and the chief of its nuclear-powered submarine taskforce – have been unequivocal that Australian submarines will be under Australian command and control. But critics such as the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull have questioned whether this control will, in practice, be tempered by the need to continue to rely on US and UK personnel for technical and other support. V Adm Jonathan Mead acknowledged last week that Australia “will have assistance” and he likened this to other major defence programs, but added that the level of this assistance could reduce over time “as we develop more and more understanding of the technology”. Keep an eye out for what the government says on this point once the details are released. 5. Will the likely extended visits by US submarines to Australia in the meantime amount to a quasi-home-porting arrangement and how does that fit in with the prime minister’s assurances about maintaining sovereign control? Reuters reported that the US would forward-deploy some its own submarines in Western Australia by around 2027. The exact details of this arrangement between the Australian and US governments will be a key point of interest and Marles has previously played down the idea of “home-porting” foreign vessels in Australia. Canberra will likely argue the arrangement is no different from other rotational visits by US forces. 6. What assurances will the US give about loosening its export controls to actually make the Aukus plan work? Will Congress go along with it? Stringent export controls in the US have long been identified as a key obstacle to making Aukus work – including in the second pillar, the push to collaborate on other advanced military technologies not just submarines. On the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday, Joe Courtney – one of the biggest supporters of Aukus in the US Congress – expressed confidence the export controls issues could be resolved with a carveout similar to the one enjoyed by Canada. 7. When and how will construction begin on the first South Australian-built submarines and does that mean any slippage in political commitments that were made to that state? This will be a politically important issue for South Australia. When Aukus was first unveiled in 2021, the Morrison government said its intention was to build at least eight nuclear-powered submarines in Adelaide. Labor reaffirmed that intention and the South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, has been seeking assurances. But the timeframe for that work starting will be of interest, given that it seems an “off-the-shelf” solution has been found to plug the capability gap. 8. How will the three countries defend the nuclear non-proliferation precedent set by the deal and will any special arrangements be put in place to reassure the region? This is going to be a critical issue, given that China has been seeking to portray the arrangement as not in keeping with the spirit of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and Indonesia and Malaysia have previously expressed concerns. The significance of the deal is that two nuclear-weapons states will be handing nuclear tech to a non-nuclear-weapons state – and some experts have raised concerns about the precedent this may set for others. Australia is firm in declaring that it is only seeking nuclear-propelled (not nuclear-armed) submarines and that the NPT does not prohibit naval nuclear propulsion. Australia is in contact with the International Atomic Energy Agency and has promised to “implement the most stringent of security protocols”. The details, however, will be important. 9. What will happen to the nuclear waste when the submarines retire from service? The government says the reactor technology “means that future nuclear-powered submarines will not require refuelling during the service life of the boat, therefore Australia will not require a civil nuclear power industry”. But we just don’t know yet what the plans are for what happens to the nuclear waste at the end of the process. 10. How does the plan fit with future technological developments? Could they be more easily detectible by the time the new subs hit the water? The Australian National University’s National Security College report Transparent Oceans? found that scientific and technological advancements could make it increasingly difficult to hide the presence of submarines and predicted oceans were “likely” or “very likely” to become transparent by the 2050s. This does tend to raise some questions about the comparative benefits of nuclear-powered submarines to avoid detection – although Mead says the issue has been taken into account and that the subs could serve as a base from which uncrewed underwater vehicle operate."

                    "bodyText": "Prime minister Anthony Albanese is set to commit Australia to the biggest national industrial redevelopment project since the Snowy Hydro electricity scheme and the British-Australian nuclear weapons research collaboration of the 1950s. The project involves considerable risk. Spanning three nations (each with multiple jurisdictions) over two or more decades, including the governments of multiple presidents and prime ministers in three countries. This seems inconceivably difficult on one level – were it not for the galvanising effects of: the rise of an increasingly authoritarian and adversarial China; the fallout from Brexit, which has helped focus UK government officials on finding new trading partners in the Indo-Pacific and new ways of validating the “special relationship” with the United States; advanced artificial intelligence, persistent satellite surveillance and drones, which make detection of diesel-electric submarines traversing long distances much easier (therefore making Australia’s existing submarines more vulnerable and less stealthy). The project risks consuming vast resources, distracting the Australian government and its Aukus partners from addressing pressing environmental and governance concerns in the Pacific and beyond. Australia, with a long history of struggling to reconcile its history (with its Anglosphere inclinations) with its geography (a sparsely populated island continent on the edge of Asia), has shown signs of being eager to be on good terms with south-east Asian and Pacific neighbours, but Aukus leaves less bandwidth for governments to respond to such issues. Recruiting, training and keeping a workforce with specialist skills in the fields of nuclear science (notably physics and engineering), coupled with a significant expansion in specialist trades, will stretch the ability of the already taxed Australian education sector. Having spent decades shifting from just-in-case to just-in-time supply chains, Australia is less resilient now than most realise. Existing capabilities exist to threaten and disrupt Australia’s numerous supply chain vulnerabilities. The nuclear propulsion submarine complicates a potential adversary’s planning options with the knowledge that they would not be able to act with impunity. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Australia has long had a fear of abandonment. In the first half of the 20th century Australia relied on British martial prowess to supplement its own (not inconsequential) military forces and, from 1942 onwards has relied more on the United States. In the 72 years since the signing of the Anzus treaty in 1951 (itself only an 800-word essay lacking mutual security guarantees) the ties that bind have deepened and broadened. For a boutique defence force like Australia’s, which proudly stresses its sovereignty, militarily it has become increasingly enmeshed and reliant on US systems – ironically enough with a view to bolster its own self-reliance. Beyond this already quite dependent level of integration with US forces and systems, Albanese has strenuously asserted that the Aukus submarine acquisition will not dilute Australian sovereignty. The calculus is that in the face of sanctions, wolf-warrior diplomacy, an increasingly authoritarian and pushy China that has been expanding its land, sea, air, cyber, space and strategic missile forces at an alarming rate, prudence dictates circumspect public engagement and a more muscular approach – speaking more softly and carrying a bigger stick. Some critics suggest the United States will eventually leave the Pacific or will be pushed out so we should be cautious about doubling down on our security ties. But its presence geographically is not temporary and its friends are more eager than ever for it to stay. Others point to domestic political uncertainty in the US. But even Trump as president doubled down on the alliance with Australia and made a concerted effort to reduce the prospect of war – including on the Korean peninsula. The view that America should back off defies the will of many in the region (notably Japan, Korea, the Philippines and many (albeit more quietly spoken) in south-east Asia and the Pacific. If anything, Aukus looks set to provide greater US resolve to stay engaged in Australia’s neighbourhood. Critics also suggest the submarines will only exacerbate tensions. I beg to differ. If handled with discretion and with neighbours treated respectfully and briefed in as best as possible, the new arrangements can be expected to bolster security and stability in the region, not undermine them. Weakness invites adventurism, it is said. This high-stakes and high-risk plan is about reducing the prospects of adventurism. Others say we will be dragged into a war over Taiwan. But what we want is the status quo maintained, not overturned. And it’s not just us. While most regional neighbours are reluctant to say so publicly, privately they are eager for the US presence to remain and for the status quo to continue. The best way to ensure that, in the face of a more assertive and muscular China, it appears, is to muscle up in response. Some would respond saying the US can’t be trusted. Look at Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011. They miss the changed dynamics of today. American strategists have a clear-eyed appreciation of the diminution of American martial prowess and of the high risk of failure in any Indo-Pacific confrontation. The unduly cocky confidence of 2003 and 2011 is a thing of the past. In my estimation, the chastened Americans can be trusted to do the right thing, having “tried everything else”, as Winston Churchill once said.

                    "bodyText": "The refresh of the integrated review of defence and foreign policy comes only two years after the original, and if Labour were to win the election it may only last a similar amount of time. Nor would it have happened if it hadn’t been for Conservative chaos, as reopening the review was the brainchild of the short-lived Liz Truss. To be fair, the war in Ukraine has upended previous assumptions, but this is not really the path taken by Rishi Sunak. A large part of what is announced focuses on China and the emerging Australia, UK and US “Aukus” partnership to provide Canberra with nuclear powered submarines to give naval technological parity with Beijing. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, has been given £5bn extra over two years, with £3bn of that going into investing in Britain’s nuclear capability, in part to facilitate the submarine build programme. Another £2bn is to restore stockpiles of ammunition sent to Ukraine and rebuild weapons supply chains, in other words a stopgap, and rather less than Wallace would have wanted. It hardly amounts to a strategic reassessment of the purpose of Britain’s military and security. Rather it amounts to a determination to stay faithful to the “Indo-Pacific tilt”, a vague notion that has amounted to deploying Britain’s working aircraft carrier to the South China Sea as well as the ongoing effort to build a new nuclear powered submarine for Australia. The events of the past year have reinforced the idea that Russia is, as Boris Johnson’s original integrated review had it, a “threat”. It was already a country that had sought to carry out nerve agent poisonings on British soil, corrupted the English legal system for its own ends, and whose hackers whether criminal or political pose a threat to government and business in the UK. Then it invaded Ukraine. But although the language emerging from Downing Street tonight describes Russia as posing a “fundamental risk” to European security and the goal is to “deny Moscow any benefit” from the attack on Ukraine, it will be the language around China that will attract the closest political scrutiny, even if that is far less important. China, previously “a systemic competitor” – a phrase generally useful, if unmemorable – has upgraded to presenting an “epoch-defining challenge” – as a nod to the Conservative backbenchers who had wanted Beijing to be designated as a threat, similar to that used to describe Russia. This, in fact, was Truss’s reason for reopening the integrated review, to make such an aggressive re-designation that would only have further inflamed already fraught relations with Beijing. Epoch-defining is a large notion, not least because epochs tend to be very long, while integrated reviews emerge every two years, and if Labour wins, the party is likely to want to refocus on Russia, if that is, the US allows them. Nevertheless “epoch-defining” also suggests the world is becoming a different kind of unsafe place. Islamist fundamentalism is in retreat, fallen sharply after the territorial defeat of Islamic State and the killing of its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In its place is a rapprochement between Russia and China, state actors with larger budgets, more weaponry and sophisticated tools at their disposal. This thinking underlies Sunak’s announcement to recommit to a target of lifting defence spending to 2.5% of GDP “in the longer term”, similar to what was announced by Johnson at the last Nato summit in June, one of his last acts before his premiership collapsed. Johnson, however, put a target date – 2030 – on when the pledge would be met, and Sunak hasn’t. This would add a little over £10bn in real terms to the defence budget, nearly £50bn this year, money that would have to come from other public services. As rearmaments go, it is more gradual than in some frontline states, such as Poland, which intends to go to above 4% of GDP. But it is more proportionate than Truss’s short-lived aspiration to take defence budgets to 3% in a notoriously profligate department; 2.5% would restore defence spending to level it was at under Labour. But quite what the fresh language means for Britain’s policy approach to China specifically is less clear. Further boosting Britain’s tiny military presence in the Indo-Pacific is not obviously good value for money for the UK’s stretched armed forces – and for now, at least, the primary threat from Beijing to Britain is its ceaseless desire to steal intellectual property, not a military one. A cautious reinvestment in British military capability ought be focused on helping Ukraine and frontline Nato states protect themselves, for example in Estonia where the UK chose to withdraw the extra British forces it had briefly based there after the assault on Ukraine. It is the security of Europe that is strategic to Britain, despite post-Brexit fantasies to the contrary."

                    "bodyText": "Politics is in the midst of a New Labour revival. Keir Starmer draws huge inspiration from his party’s landslide win back in 1997. Tony Blair offers him advice, and regularly tours TV and radio studios. Gordon Brown has found a role as British politics’ thundering conscience. That former titan of “comms” Alastair Campbell is now a super-successful podcaster and caller-out of Brexit lies; over the past few days, he has been hyperactively defending Gary Lineker and decrying the management of the BBC. There is even something of New Labour in Rishi Sunak: his faux-classless speaking style, and his attempts to sell himself as a master of technocratic efficiency, determined to pull his party back into the mainstream. But now, an uneasy anniversary arrives. Next Monday will mark 20 years since the invasion of Iraq: a reminder not just of Blair et al’s responsibility for the greatest political and humanitarian disaster the UK had been involved in since the second world war, but a moment when the supposed political centre ground suddenly lurched somewhere reckless and catastrophic. Support for the invasion, let us not forget, also enveloped the Conservative party, and the vast majority of the British press. In that sense, the anniversary is a vivid reminder of the perils of groupthink, and the grim results of squeezing complex realities into simple narratives. In a deeply scarred, crisis-prone Iraq – and the wider region – people still live with the consequences as a matter of everyday experience. Here, by contrast, most of us have the awful luxury of thinking of the war as a distant, fading set of events. Only last week, a columnist in the Financial Times mused that “within the western world, the Iraq war has left little trace”, and that the invasion “didn’t shake politics”. But an episode as significant as this was always going to have profound effects on the UK, thanks to the war’s sheer disastrousness, and the fact that the case for our involvement soon turned out to have had no basis in fact. The result was a crisis of public trust that festers on. There was an early sense of this in February 2003, when more than a million people arrived in London to demonstrate their opposition to a war that felt more likely by the hour. Pick through reports that day, and one thing in particular burns through: a sense that politics and power had lurched away from the public, and left a huge and very uneasy gap. Quotes to that effect were gathered by the dozen: “Something’s happened recently, to me and so many friends – we just know there’s something going wrong in this country. No one’s being consulted”; “This is not about party politics, but a simple feeling that democracy has been forgotten.” Less than a month after the invasion began, the Iraqi capital apparently fell to US forces, and millions of us were told once again that we were simply wrong. But anyone who remembers the war will be familiar with what happened next: endless violence, huge levels of death, the horrors perpetrated by US personnel at the Abu Ghraib prison, and so much more. Then, in October 2004, the most breathtaking news of all was coughed out. The BBC put it succinctly: “Iraq had no stockpiles of biological, chemical or nuclear weapons before last year’s US-led invasion, the chief US weapons inspector has concluded.” In 2005, Blair won an election with the support of less than a quarter of the electorate, and Labour’s Commons majority fell from 167 seats to 66. “There is little doubt that historians will look back on the 2005 election as the Iraq election,” said the Guardian. When the SNP defeated Labour in the Scottish elections of 2007 and that country’s politics underwent a watershed change – just as Blair stepped down – it happened partly because the SNP’s then leader, Alex Salmond, had successfully tapped into huge anger about the war, baldly accusing Blair of lying (as one academic study put it, “voter problems with Westminster were responsible, with some dissatisfaction with the performance and leadership of the UK government and also with the issue of Iraq”). The financial crash came a year later, followed by further proof that politics was now in an unstable and volatile state: 2010 saw the flurry of support for the Liberal Democrats known as “Cleggmania”, and the election of a hung parliament. And then came a run of seismic shifts: the rise of Ukip, the Scottish independence referendum of 2014 and the election as Labour leader of Jeremy Corbyn – whose reputation for a supposedly righteous kind of politics was rooted in his opposition to the Iraq adventure. The right was speeding down the isolationist and parochial road that led to Brexit, while the left embraced the kind of ideas that Blair had always warned against. Whatever political story I was covering during this period, I heard the same refrains from voters: bitter verdicts on his time in office, and dismissals of politicians as liars. Iraq was hardly the sole reason for this, but it was always present and correct. The idea of politics as a mendacious trade is an ancient cliche, but in this instance, people were not wrong. Next week’s anniversary, in fact, ought to serve as a reminder of the three deceptions so central to the politics of the war, and the public disaffection they triggered. It was hardly a revelation, but the 2016 Chilcot report confirmed it: Blair and his aides presented weak and patchy intelligence as authoritative evidence of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. He repeatedly assured the country that no decision about whether or not to go to war had been taken, but his assurance to Bush in July 2002 that “I will be with you, whatever” suggested that his mind had long since been made up. Then, as the invasion loomed and the UN security council considered its options, Blair said that “the French position is that France will vote no, whatever the circumstances”, whereas President Jacques Chirac had said something very different: that UN weapons inspectors needed to be given more time, and if Iraq did not cooperate, “regrettably, the war would become inevitable. [But it] isn’t today.” Our memory of these deceptions may have faded, but their effects ripple on. Iraq hideously sullied Blair and Brown’s domestic record and marked the end of the New Labour vision of Britain as a young, confident country. It reduced the fantasies of “liberal interventionism” to ash, and deepened the disaffection and unease that would lead to our exit from Europe. For the people now in charge of the two main Westminster parties, there may be comfort in the idea that we might somehow return to being the comparatively quiet, orderly, outward-facing nation we were 20 years ago. But there is no going back there, and the horrors and political contortions of the war are one of the key reasons why.

                    "bodyText": "Is there a school for autocrats? As if by rote, authoritarian leaders around the world trot out remarkably similar justifications for their repressive actions, democratic deficits and policy failures. These typically include scary claims that their country is under attack by foreign forces and saboteurs or is the victim of a global conspiracy. Perhaps they have all taken an online correspondence course for aspiring dictators. Tyrants R Us. China produced classic examples of the genre last week. Accepting a third term, President Xi Jinping urged the country to unite behind him. “In the coming period, the risks and challenges we’re facing will only become more and more numerous and grim,” Xi warned. The US and its allies were trying to “encircle, suppress and contain” China. Only he, Xi, could ensure victory in the coming “struggle”. “Après moi, le déluge,” as King Louis XV supposedly said. Qin Gang, China’s hawkish new foreign minister, hammered home the aggressively paranoid message of his all-powerful patron. He accused the Biden administration of orchestrating “hysterical neo-McCarthyism” with the furore over last month’s shooting down of a Chinese balloon and accusations that Beijing is about to supply arms to Russia for its war in Ukraine. A lot else of what Qin had to say made dismaying listening for analysts who thought they discerned a softening of tone after Xi’s meeting with the US president, Joe Biden, in November. Kevin Rudd, a former Australian prime minister and a China expert, argued recently that an economic slowdown was forcing Xi to take a conciliatory line and rein in abrasive “wolf warrior” diplomacy. Confounding such optimistic assessments, Qin claimed Biden’s assertion that Washington sought competition, not conflict with China was a big lie. The US, he said, was bent on “malicious confrontation”. Channelling Vladimir Putin’s unsubtle threats, he hinted this could ultimately lead to nuclear war, placing “the future of humanity” at risk. “The US side’s so-called competition is ... a zero-sum game where you die and I live. If the US does not hit the brakes but continues to speed down the wrong path ... there will surely be conflict,” Qin warned. To underline the point, he stressed China would take “all necessary measures” to seize Taiwan, which, he claimed bizarrely, the US was trying to destroy. He said “an invisible hand” – presumably the US and Nato – was deliberately exacerbating the Ukraine war in order to serve its geopolitical agenda. And he accused rearming Japan of colluding in a “new cold war” – even as China raises defence spending by 7.2%. Again speaking on Xi’s authority, Qin last month also effectively rejected the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which China signed. “The right of all countries to independently choose one’s own path of human rights development should be respected ... Imposing one’s model upon others would entail endless troubles,” he said. It’s an old line, but it’s the kind of disingenuous thinking that has facilitated horrific abuses in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. Imagine if this approach were applied globally. All such statements may be seen as pure school-of-autocrats dogma. They reveal a generic mentality that mixes insecurity and hubris, twisted by distorted realities, outright lies, immorality and self-deception. Scapegoating of outsiders for policy own goals is habitual. Oppression, discrimination, censorship and corruption are built in. An Iranian ayatollah, Burmese general or Syrian secret policeman would instantly recognise the paradigm. Yet these are the internal mechanics of the global model that Xi and his emulators want to foist onto the 21st-century world in place of the autocrat’s pet hate, the UN-endorsed international rules-based order. And this is why it is so important, as Charles Dunst argues in a new book, Defeating the Dictators, that western democracies fight for their values and fulfil their peoples’ expectations. “How can we become the world’s model once again?” Dunst asks. In hailing Xi’s “exemplary” alliance with Putin, Qin described a nightmare vision of global hegemony, run on authoritarian, anti-democratic, anti-human rights lines. “With China and Russia working together, the world will have a driving force,” he said. “The more unstable the world becomes, the more imperative it is for China and Russia to steadily advance relations ... The strategic partnership will surely grow from strength to strength.” What a truly terrible thought. Is such a Big Brother-ish future inevitable? Not if western leaders can positively engage with China rather than feed its paranoia and resentment with more sanctions and sabre-rattling. If Xi feels “contained” and “encircled”, he partly has himself to blame – but he is not technically wrong, commentator Ed Luce argued. Perhaps the US should try harder, post-balloon, to find ways to talk. Dividing the international community into good and bad guys in a crusade for western-style democracy, as Biden advocates, will not eliminate the threat of a world run by thuggish tyrants – and could make it worse. Harvard professor Stephen Walt suggests a more balanced, mutually respectful multipolar world might better suit American interests. The US had been “loath to abandon a position of unchallenged primacy” since the Soviet collapse, he wrote. It’s time that changed. Yet the problem, ultimately, is not China or Russia or their people. It’s their violent, none-too-bright autocratic leaders and evil systems they represent. As long as Xi and Putin, with their “no limits” relationship, threaten or use force to impose their will at home and abroad, and encourage other leaders to behave likewise to the detriment of free peoples everywhere, the prospect of an east-west collision grows. To avoid such an outcome, the highly personalised Xi-Putin axis must first be broken. It’s possible to hope. Autocrats are feared but rarely loved. History teaches that when it all goes wrong – and it will – they are on their own."

                    "bodyText": "The Labour party is planning to put the UK at the head of a worldwide green industrial revolution, with a massive US-style, public-private investment scheme targeted at the most deprived regions. In an interview with the Observer, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, who will travel to Washington in May to meet senior Democrats, says a Labour government will follow the model of US president Joe Biden’s hugely ambitious regional recovery plan, using the climate crisis as the catalyst for economic revival. She says Labour’s new national wealth fund, to be endowed with an initial £8bn of funding from the state but which it is hoped will then pull in private investment, will be given a specific remit to focus on green industrial revival in deprived areas with regional targets to create hundreds of thousands of jobs outside London and the south-east. Ahead of the spring budget on Wednesday, in which the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, will be under pressure to prevent an exodus of UK green industries to the US and the EU – both of which are preparing incentives to lure green firms from overseas – both Labour and the Tories are determined to ensure the UK will not be left behind. Hunt is set to announce a £20bn investment in technology to reduce Britain’s carbon emissions in the budget, as well as plans to boost the nuclear sector with a competition to develop small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Many UK companies, Reeves said, were desperate to invest in areas such as offshore wind, tidal energy, green hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, but feared that without government backing – on a partnership model like that pioneered by Biden in his Inflation Reduction Act – they “would not get off the ground”. “The Tories are the last people in town believing that the ‘laissez faire’ approach of leaving it all to the market can work. Everyone else recognises that, in a world of such huge change and increased competition between nations for this investment, you have to have this partnership approach,” she said. “All of this is up for grabs, no-one is doing a lot of this stuff at scale yet. We could be global leaders in some of this. There is a real urgency because growth is so low. This would be real levelling up, where the government has failed. We have got a serious plan and we just want a chance to get on and get started with it.” Several key UK-based companies are now examining where best to operate. Jaguar Land Rover’s owner, Tata Motors, has reportedly asked the UK government for more than £500m in state subsidies to build a battery factory in Somerset, a move seen as crucial to the future of the entire British car industry. Reeves said: “The government said we were going to get electric vehicle production and batteries here but we haven’t and Jaguar Land Rover (Britain’s biggest car maker) are on the verge of making a really big decision. It is crucial that batteries are produced by JLR in Britain or, as night follows day, more car production will move overseas.” In January, the UK battery start-up Britishvolt collapsed into administration, with the majority of its 300 staff made redundant after talks about rescue bids failed. The company’s efforts to build a large facility near Blyth came unstuck as it struggled to find a cash injection to pursue the project. It has now been bought by an Australian company. Labour has already committed to investing £28bn a year – or £224bn over its first eight years in government – on climate measures. Reeves says it will aim to create 450,000 new jobs over a decade from green industrial projects – in which the UK public will have a stake – including 50,000 in the north-west and Yorkshire, and 30,000 in the north-east, the East Midlands, the West Midlands and the east of England. Reeves is planning to meet key architects of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) during her May visit and make a speech from there to “show the UK can deliver global leadership on climate change, on new industries and on the future of economic thinking”. Biden’s IRA was signed into law in August last year and aims to spur investment in green technology by devoting billions of dollars in subsidies through grants, loans and tax credits to public and private entities. It has a strong focus on electric vehicles and the battery industry. Since it was announced it has drawn investment into areas such as Michigan, a rust belt state, where Ford has revealed plans to build a $3.5bn electric vehicle battery plant that would create 2,500 jobs. The company explicitly referenced the Biden legislation as being a factor in its decision to locate there instead of Canada or Mexico. The EU is expected to unveil more details this week of its net-zero industry act, which is also designed to lead to a big acceleration of green technology in EU member states, with recent changes to state aid rules also in the pipeline. The Institute for Directors recently called for a UK version of the Inflation Reduction Act to “incentivise much-needed green investment” and prevent the UK being left behind. Reeves said: “The exciting thing about some of the new industries of the future, whether it is floating offshore wind, or carbon capture and storage, or green hydrogen, is that they are going to create good jobs in places outside London and the south-east, in former industrial areas, in coastal communities. We are taking inspiration from president Biden and the US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen.”"

Here’s a recap of the day’s news: Prime minister Anthony Albanese has touched down in the US where he is expected to make a major announcement, alongside president Joe Biden and UK prime minister Rishi Sunak, about the future of Australia’s $100bn nuclear subs program. US congressman Joe Courtney, co-chair of Washington’s “AUKUS Caucus” has promised the second-hand subs Australia will buy from the US will be “a very thoughtful project” and will be under “Australian control” in an appearance on ABC Insiders on Sunday, saying: “No one’s going to be foisting off clunkers to good friends and allies.” New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet officially launched his party’s campaign on Sunday with a number of policies aimed at children. Perrottet asked members of the Coalition to look toward the future – even as federal members of his own party avoided putting in an appearance. Flood waters at Burketown in north-west Queensland have peaked on Sunday, after 45 residents evacuated the area in anticipation of record rises. Lack of funding to blame for lack of transplants, NSW Labor says The NSW opposition has pointed the finger at the government following reports children are being put at risk because of a lack of pediatric heart transplants at the Children’s Hospital at Westmead. The hospital completed five of the transplants in 2021 when Covid-19 travel restrictions were enforced, but has reverted to transferring patients to Melbourne’s Royal Children’s Hospital, Nine reported on Sunday. The Melbourne hospital is home to Australia’s National Paediatric Heart Transplant Centre. Between one and three children have died each year over the past five years in NSW because they were either too sick to be transferred to Melbourne or it was impractical for their families to go interstate, Nine reported. NSW opposition health spokesman Ryan Park blamed the absence of the transplants in Sydney on a lack of funding by the Liberal National government, along with a staffing crisis and a “long overdue review” that began in 2021. These reports are obviously very concerning. Children’s lives are being placed at risk and this is not acceptable. At the end of 2021, a review into the Nationally Funded Centre was started and to date it still isn’t finished. The government has failed to ensure that this review was completed and recommendations implemented. Meanwhile lives are being lost. The NSW health system cannot cope with another four years of Band Aid solutions. – AAP Copper thieves caused $1.5m in damage at Tasmanian gold processing plant Police are investigating a break in at a Beaconsfield gold processing plant after thieves attempted to steal copper wire, causing an estimated $1.5m in damage. Officers responded to reports of a break-in at Rifle Range Road on Sunday morning using a front-end loader stolen from a neighbouring business. Inspector Dean McMahon said it is believed the thieves wrapped a chain around a mass of copper cables close to where they attached to a transformer and tried to rip them free using the front-end load. This caused the transformer to buckle and damage part of the overhead cabling structure. This incident has caused significant damage to a local business and Tasmania police are following up a number of avenues of inquiry. Police have asked anyone who noticed anything suspicious in the area overnight to contact police on 131 444 or report to Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Not enough nuclear scientists in Australia to meet demand Australia will need to develop the know-how in nuclear science if it wants to acquire nuclear submarines, according to the Australian Academy of Science (AAS). AAS president Prof Chennupati Jagadish said on Sunday building this capability will be “central” to ensuring the programs success but Australia currently faces a skills crisis. Even before Aukus, there has been an increased demand for knowledge in nuclear science in Australia. We are significantly behind our peer nations in national nuclear and radiation science capability. The Aukus partnership to acquire nuclear-powered defence submarines, the increasing use of radiotherapies in medicine, focuses on quantum technologies, development of materials robust enough to withstand space radiation – all these sectors require a deep understanding of nuclear physics and subatomic interactions to ensure they are safe, effective. Prof Jagadish said the number of trained scientists in Australia is not enough to meet the expected demand, which is leaving Australia “overly dependent” on overseas expertise – and without the capacity to train new nuclear scientists. Formula for indexing Medicare a ‘joke’: AMA Australian Medical Association president Prof Steve Robson says the formula for indexing Medicare is a “joke” and has reiterated calls for government to act to ensure healthcare remains affordable. Under the current system, the cost of hospital treatments and medical services are indexed to the department of finance’s Wage Cost Index. This is supposed to inform how much of the cost of a medical practice the government will help subsidise. However, Prof Robson says a freeze on indication there is a growing gap between what the suggested cost of running a medical practice is and the actual cost. The formula for indexing Medicare has become a joke. It is delivering an indexation rate that falls well behind the rate of increase in key economic measures like the Consumer Price Index, Average Weekly Earnings, and the Wage Price Index. Years of inadequate indexation has meant the Medicare rebate no longer bears any relationship to the actual cost of providing high-quality services to patients, and this is one reason why we’re seeing more practices unable to offer bulk billing for even the most vulnerable of patients, with wages and increasing practice running costs all funded from the rebate. Prof Robson pointed to a recent decision by Independent Health and Aged Care Pricing Authority (IHACPA) as more evidence IHACPA indexed the National Efficient Price (NEP) for 2023–24 at a rate of 2.9 per cent per annum, plus an additional 0.81 per cent to account for increases in the minimum superannuation guarantee between 2020–21 and 2023–24. The AMA analysed the effect of poor Medicare indexation on the item most often used by doctors, the Level B item for consultations lasting less than 20 minutes, and identified $8.6bn the government has “saved” since 1993. The AMA Gaps Poster demonstrates that successive governments have been stripping healthcare funding from Australian taxpayers through poor indexation and shifting the cost of care onto everyday Australians. We can see how poor indexation saves the government money, but this is really stripping out essential funding in Medicare by stealth, with patients bearing the brunt of higher out-of-pocket costs. Doctors can’t keep absorbing these costs and if the government is serious about addressing affordability and access to medical care including general practice, it just can’t ignore indexation, it’s as simple as that. NSW Liberal election campaign launch in pictures Wet and windy across the north-east Australia It’s been a wet and windy Sunday across the north-east of the country, with flooding in some regions. A major flood warning has been issued in north-west Queensland as Burketown residents have evacuated to escape rising flood waters overnight. Meanwhile heavy rain is possible among central, southern and south-east Queensland with a slight risk of large hail and damaging wind in some parts. These weather warnings extend down into New South Wales with thunderstorms possible in north-east quarter, ranges and southern inland plains. Moving further south the situation is calm around Tasmania with temperatures relatively stable. And looking out to the week ahead, warm weather is expected for much of Australia, with temperatures hotter than average in Western Australia and inland South Australia. BBC response to Lineker comments ‘really farcical’, Craig Foster says Former Socceroo Craig Foster has backed BBC presenter Gary Lineker, who was suspended from the UK broadcaster after criticising the government over its immigration program. Speaking to the ABC on Sunday, Foster said Lineker was right to voice his opposition to the UK’s proposed immigration policy on the basis that it violated the human rights of refugees. Foster said that UK’s proposed policy was “Australian designed and exported”. The comments that Gary made, however well-framed or otherwise, were absolutely accurate and I think it is fantastic that a public figure in the sporting environment is prepared to do so. He went on to say the “entire response” by the BBC has been “really farcical”, joking about a recent report that BBC chairman Richard Sharp, failed to disclose his role in arranging loans for Boris Johnson. In addition, he congratulated Lineker’s colleagues on their decision to refuse to broadcast in solidarity with Lineker and called on others to join them. What they should all be doing is speaking in solidarity with the refugees that Gary was talking about. That is the most important issue here. So I would love to see Alan Shearer and Ian Wright and these legendary, loved, former England international players, now be saying: ‘Listen, I also agree with his underlying views and I stand also with the human rights of asylum seekers and refugees, both here in the UK and all around the world.’ So now, there has been a huge storm and I think they can use that political environment and that social capital, not just in the UK but everywhere – we’re talking about in Australia, to now lend that to asylum seekers and refugees to put your attention there. For more on the row triggered by Lineker’s suspension at the BBC, read the full story: Electric cars spark interest for young female mechanics Girls at the Bendigo Tech School showed off progress on their electric conversion of a Range Rover at Sydney’s Fully Charged event on Sunday, with its frame stripped back and painted bold green, and a Tesla motor replacing a bulky petrol engine. Project assistant Imani Dunne, 18, said the vehicle was now as little as five months away from complete and, perhaps more tellingly, had already inspired girls working on it to enter the automotive industry. The school’s Girls in STEAM project, which began in 2021 with a donation from a local gold mining company, has seen more than 20 girls from Bendigo schools work to convert the Range Rover from a classic petrol car to electric four-wheel drive. The young mechanics also worked with Australian automotive partners, including Zero EV to find an electric motor, Fellten on mounts for the motor, and Hattam Street Tyre and Mechanical to assemble the chassis. But more than creating an electric car, Dunne said the project had already encouraged two girls to pursue a career as a mechanic, another to consider becoming a fabricator, while she planned to study civil engineering. The one thing I can’t say enough about this project is how good it is for girls’ self-esteem. Guys try something and if they’re not good at it they go ‘oh well, I had a crack’. If a girl tries something and she doesn’t do well she goes ‘I don’t like anything in that field’. Bendigo Tech School director Graeme Wiggins said the project was created to “get young women into engineering and trade pathways to address that under representation in the industry”. What they’re getting out of it is incredible confidence. They’re developing skills and they’re also developing a passion for electrification, for what we see as the future of manufacturing in this country now that [traditional] automotive manufacturing is finished. Wiggins said the project was also designed to start a conversation about electric vehicles in regional areas. The finished Range Rover will stay in Bendigo, he said, and be made available to rent in order to raise funds for the school’s next project. – AAP Prime minister Anthony Albanese has touched down in the US ahead of an announcement regarding the future of Australia’s nuclear subs program on Monday. Twenty hours on a Qantas plane: the future of aviation or fresh hell in economy? From late 2025, Qantas hopes to run the first of its “Project Sunrise” flights – up to 20 hours non-stop from the east coast of Australia to Europe and the US east coast. Australia’s national carrier has trumpeted the flights as “the final frontier of aviation”, but health and industry experts hold concerns for the passenger experience and question whether eliminating a stopover will ultimately increase aircraft emissions. Qantas first announced its vision to run the ultra long-haul routes in 2017, but Covid pushed back the predicted 2022 launch. With global aviation now booming again thanks to the post-pandemic hunger for travel, Project Sunrise is firmly back on the agenda. The airline already runs non-stop flights from Perth to London and Rome, which have proved popular despite costing more than traditional services that stop over in Asia. Qantas runs Boeing 787s from Perth to Europe, and has used that aircraft for a test flight on the Sydney-London route, but it says Project Sunrise will rely on the superior fuel efficiency of Airbus’s A350-1000. But despite grand plans for the new service, Qantas has engaged scientists from the University of Sydney to study the health implications of what will become the world’s longest flights, and to minimise the body clock impact of potentially seeing the sun rise twice on the same journey. For more on this story, read the full report by Guardian Australia’s transport reporter Elias Visontay. Perrottet promises ‘future fund’ for every child if re-elected Premier Dominic Perrottet has pledged to set up a “future fund” for every child in NSW if re-elected. The account would begin with $400 in state funds for every child under 10 with additional funds from parents welcomed. The government would match deposits from the family into the fund by up to $400 annually. Perrottet said children could end up with $28,000 by the time they enter adulthood. This policy is a downpayment to secure the future dreams of our children. This explains the children. Perrottet pledges $1.2bn to build and upgrade public schools Perrottet, has pledged $1.2bn to build and upgrade public schools across the state if his government is returned. He also used the campaign launch to announce a new selective school in Box Hill. He says: The children of our state should have access to the best schools and the best education, no matter where they live. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet takes the stage at campaign launch The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has taken to the stage at his party’s 2023 campaign launch. He was welcomed to the podium by more than two dozen children who remain seated behind him. He starts by thanking his family, former prime minister, John Howard, and the leader of the Nationals, Paul Toole. Perrottet says the state is in a better place than it was when the government came to power more than a decade ago. He says: People are once again proud to say they come from NSW. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet has been welcomed to the stage at the Liberal party launch with … dozens of children. He begins his speech by thanking his family, John Howard and Paul Toole. Former prime minister, John Howard, has been given a special welcome to the event, along with deputy premier, Paul Toole, and the premier, Dominic Perrottet’s wife, Helen Perrottet. Holsworthy candidacy, Tina Ayyad, kicked off the event with an acknowledgment of country ahead of the national anthem. NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, has told the Liberal crowd the opposition leader, Chris Minns, would be beholden to unions and the gaming lobby if elected into government. He said: Chris Minns is a man beholden to the unions and bends over backwards for the gaming lobby. There is no greater threat to our state and its economy than Chris Minns. The New South Wales Liberal campaign launch will get under way shortly in Sydney’s west. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, will present his vision for the state to the party faithful at the Liverpool Catholic Club, a week after Labor’s launch. Federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, will not be in attendance. Voters head to the polls in two weeks in what analysts predict will be one of the closest elections in recent memory. New process to handle noise complaints if NSW Labor wins government Labor will seek to simplify how residents complain about noise and compliance issues from pubs and music venues, and encourage a mediation process instead of fines that punish bars and clubs, if they form government in New South Wales. The reforms proposed by Labor come amid a spate of single neighbourhood complaints threatening the way in which venues across Sydney operate. There are currently seven agencies that can deal with complaints about venues, and Labor plans to streamline this process. If Labor wins government, it will also pay half the cost of soundproofing upgrades to make venues compliant with noise standards. John Graham, Labor’s night time economy and music spokesperson, said music venues “are beloved by their local communities” and that Labor wants “to balance the needs of music venues and neighbours so that we don’t lose these important cultural assets”. He added: More than half the music venues in NSW have closed under the last decade of Liberal government, and more of our best operators are currently at risk. There are currently seven agencies that regulate sound in NSW. Labor will simplify the process so that residents know who to phone if they have an issue and neighbours and venues can peacefully mediate, and we’ll provide practical support to venues for soundproofing.

The world’s largest annual nudie dip, Sydney Skinny, is returning after a three-year hiatus. More than 2,000 swimmers are expected to plunge starkers into the water off Cobbler’s beach in the city’s north on Sunday. Event founder Nigel Marsh believes this year’s edition could have a stronger showing than the 2018 world record-setting swim when 2,505 naked women participated in the Irish strip and dip. We think this is the year we might break some records and prove to the world how vibrant and spirited Sydney can be. Every year, about 2,000 swimmers brave Hobart’s chilly River Derwent during the Dark Mofo nude solstice swim. In November, Sydneysiders also stripped en masse and swam at Bondi beach as part of a large-scale artwork for renowned photographer Spencer Tunick. Sydney Skinny organisers are hoping for a similar turnout on the event’s 10th anniversary. Our event is for everyone who wants to step outside of their comfort zone. If you’ve ever been apprehensive about doing something so daring – you will be looked after, and you’ll have the time of your life. This year’s swim is part of a collaboration with charity Skin Check Champions to help raise awareness of the importance of skin cancer checks. – AAP Parliamentary inquiry to examine vaping risks A parliamentary inquiry will look into the health risks of vaping and how many young people are using e-cigarettes in a bid to further slash smoking rates. The Queensland government on Sunday announced the inquiry to better inform people about the dangers of vaping. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the parliament’s health and environment committee will investigate what schools are doing to discourage vaping as e-cigarettes worryingly grow in popularity among young people. Fewer people are smoking but we are seeing a significant number of people vaping. If vaping is a stepping stone to smoking, we need to ensure Queenslanders, especially young Queenslanders, are aware of the health risks. As of 2020, the prevalence of daily smoking in Queensland had dropped by 47% since 2002, research from the Queensland chief health officer’s office showed. However, people who tried e-cigarettes were three times more likely to take up smoking, the Australian National University found. The public needed to be made aware of what e-cigarettes contained, whether that be nicotine or dangerous chemicals, Palaszczuk said. Health minister Yvette D’Ath added while many vaping products were marketed as “nicotine free”, that was not always the case. E-cigarettes could also contain other chemicals like those found in nail polish remover, she said. The committee is expected to report back about the inquiry by 31 August. – AAP An overview of Australia’s $100bn nuclear submarine program With the pending announcement about the $100bn nuclear submarine program it is worth revisiting some of the work by Daniel Hurst, Guardian Australia’s foreign affairs and defence correspondent who covered the delicate diplomatic tightrope the Australian government is attempting walk. Not only has Australia been attempted to reassure its near neighbours, Indonesia and Malaysia, but its real struggle has been managing its relationship with China. But the program itself heralds a “generational change” in the way the Australian navy operates as it becomes the seventh country in the world with nuclear-powered boats. No casualties reported in Indonesia volcano eruption Indonesia’s most active volcano, Mount Merapi, has blocked out the sun and blanketed several villages in ash on the densely populated island of Java. The volcano began its latest eruption on Saturday, sending plumes of hot cloud 100 metres into the sky and belching clouds of hot ash, rock, lava and gas down its 7km slopes. No casualties have been reported but residents have been warned to keep clear of the disaster zone. The eruption marks the biggest lava flow since November 2020. Mount Merapi last erupted in 2010, killing more than 350 people. Residents of Burketown in north-west Queensland face an anxious wait as murky water slowly floods their community ahead of an expected peak. Some 45 locals took their last chance to evacuate on Saturday but others chose to stay despite warnings to get out, with sewerage and power turned off due to flood risks. Most of those who left were flown by helicopter to nearby Doomadgee and then more than 300km south to Mount Isa. Footage taken from a helicopter above the flood zone on Saturday showed the town and surrounding areas were already flooded. Properties, roads and other infrastructure were inundated, with several aircraft shown perched on a rare strip of elevated concrete. This is Burketown’s worst ever flooding, with the Albert River surpassing the 6.78-metre record of 2011. The disaster is expected to peak on Sunday, although superintendent Tom Armitt told the ABC it was unclear exactly when that would be as the water level had already surpassed flood modelling. We don’t know how much ground will be left if the water continues to peak and cover all the ground. If we get to the stage where we are having to shift and move people to rooftops, that makes a whole different level of complexity. A forecast for severe thunderstorms and rain in southeast Queensland was downgraded on Saturday but heavy falls are still possible. Several towns, cattle stations and isolated settlements in the southeast gulf of Carpentaria remain cut off and are relying on supplies sent by air or barge after weeks of torrential rain. – AAP The ‘safety net’ overlooked in NSW election promises on housing Recent figures released by the Community Housing Industry Association New South Wales (CHIA NSW) show that there has been an 8% increase in the social housing waitlist in western Sydney. There are now 18,377 individuals and families waiting in the region. Many are in the queue in areas with wait times of over 10 years. The figures also show a 15% increase in demand for social housing across the state, with 57,750 individuals and families on the waitlist. With the NSW state election less than three weeks away, CHIA NSW’s chief executive, Mark Degotardi, says the major parties have so far only paid “lip service” to the problem. We have politicians paying lip service, but neither party has stepped up and made clear commitments to confront the crisis. It is not too late. The major parties can help solve this crisis by increasing the state’s supply of social and affordable housing. But we cannot afford to wait. The schemes so far proposed by both parties are for homebuyers or owners, with some support for renters recently announced by the premier, Dominic Perrottet. Labor has proposed merging three existing government agencies into a single body in an effort to address the social housing supply. But advocates say these policies don’t do enough to address the lived reality of renters under duress in NSW, and particularly in western Sydney. For more on this story ahead of the NSW Liberal campaign launch on Sunday, read the full feature story by Guardian Australia’s Mostafa Rachwani. More Australians in work forecast ahead of jobs numbers It is expected that the latest employment statistics will show more Australians are back in work when the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases its latest report this week. Some economists expect to see a recovery in employment in February after seasonal factors contributed to an unexpected loss of 11,500 jobs in the economy in January. The ABS noted then that there was an unusually large number of people yet to start work who were attached to a job in January. This means those new hires were not counted as employed and will likely show up in the February count instead. Commonwealth Bank economists expect to see 45,000 jobs added to the economy when the data is released on Thursday with the jobless rate holding firm at 3.7% and the participation rate lifting a touch from 66.5% to 66.6%. The jobs result will feed into the Reserve Bank of Australia’s decision-making on interest rates, with a soft result expected to be supportive of a pause in its current hiking cycle sooner rather than later. Also of interest later in the week will be the Productivity Commission’s five-yearly review of Australia’s productivity. While not officially due until May, treasurer Jim Chalmers has brought the publishing date of the expansive review forward. The report is expected to contain a long list of recommendations to boost Australia’s sluggish productivity growth. – AAP Guardian Australia reporter Tamsin Rose is heading to the NSW Liberals launch for all the fun. We’ll bring you the latest as it develops. Control of submarines will remain with Australia: Courtney Courtney appears confident that control of the submarines will remain with Australia, saying “no one wants to be in a situation where there is any conflict of who is in charge or who is giving orders or who is taking orders”. We understand that that is precious for every nation, to be able to control and make their own decisions. On the question of technology sharing, Courtney says work is underway to arrange a “carve-out” for the Aukus alliance to avoid “barriers” in technology transfer required to ensure the submarines can run. We have such a carve-out for Canada today. Again, the defence sectors are much more free-flowing and seamless because of the fact that we made that adjustment, and that is going to be a focus. However, he also said the “overall politics” of the US Congress is “a little tricky right now” but “everybody understands that this is something that definitely needs to be focused on”. Virginia-class submarines are ‘of the highest quality’: Courtney No one will be foisting off clunkers on good friends and allies. He adds that the subs have 33-year lifespans and no requirement to refuel, which provides the type of stealth and operability required, what “the strategic requirement requires”. Courtney says China’s missile force is “driving this decision” because “surface ships are so vulnerable right now”. The congressman says evidence of this comes from Ukraine, where the Russian warship Moskva was hit as it was on patrol. On the question of joint-crewing – which goes to concerns about Australia’s ability to control its own nuclear submarines – Courtney says the prospect has been “over-hyped”. We need to train up the Australian sailors and officers in terms of nuclear propulsion which is all we’re talking about here, not nuclear weapons. And when the time comes for the deeds, the title to be handed to the government of Australia of a vessel, that again is going to be totally with the full understanding that it is going to be under Australian control. Courtney says “there is not question about it” that the US will need Australian help to build the new submarines, though he also says the actually manufacturing process will be of a “mixture” of work contributed from the US, UK and Australia. Everybody is going to be contributing to each other’s needs, and certainly to the extent that, you know, again, getting the Australian workforce sort of up and running, the fact that there is not an existing Aukus submarine program right away in the late 20s or mid-20s. Courtney says the program will help Australia to develop “the skillset to build its own subs” and that “we want this program to succeed”. I think everybody understands, you know, this is not something that you can flip a switch and you’ve got an industrial base to take on really probably one of the most complex types of manufacturing imaginable. You are building a vessel that is operating in an environment that does not support human life. I mean, everything has to be perfect. US ‘confident’ in capacity to supply nuclear submarines to Australia US congressman Joe Courtney says he is “confident” the US will have enough industrial capacity to supply up to five Virginia-class nuclear submarines to Australia. Obviously there was a counter-communication on a bipartisan basis from the leadership committee that pointed out that this is not a zero-sum game. If you look historically at the sub base in the US which is well over 100 years old, it has grown and contracted given again the external events, the security environment. If you look at the height of the Cold War, we were building four attack submarines at the same time as ballistics program. Though he said “we may have to do more outsourcing”, Courtney says 21 Virginia-class submarines have been built over the last two decades, with two more expected this year. He also said the workforce in US shipyards has expanded by 4,000 this year, with 5,200 more next year. The NSW Liberal party will hold its campaign launch on Sunday but federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton will not be in attendance. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet will head into Sydney’s south-western suburbs for the Liberal party’s official campaign launch on Sunday. The area will be decisive in who wins the 25 March election, with the notionally Labor seat of Leppington and the Liberals’ Holsworthy both on small margins. Recent political polls suggest a tight race, with a Labor minority government as the most likely result. A decisive seat is Holsworthy, held by the Liberals on a 6% margin, where the sitting MP Melanie Gibbons was dumped at preselection. In her place sits Tina Ayyad, a former deputy mayor and the wife of Liverpool Mayor Ned Mannoun. The Liberals would also need to retain East Hills (0.1 per%) and regain the southern Sydney electorate of Heathcote (notionally Labor) to keep its grip on government. As the minority Coalition government seeks to hang on to power for a fourth term in NSW, Dutton has been a notable absentee on the campaign trail. Since November last year, Dutton has made only one media appearance in Sydney – a press conference alongside the independent Fairfield mayor Frank Carbone – while visiting the city for the funeral of Cardinal George Pell and the 20th anniversary of the Bali bombings. For more on Dutton’s absence from the campaign, read the full report by Guardian Australia’s Michael McGowan. – with AAP US congressman Joe Courtney is speaking to David Speers on ABC Insiders this morning ahead of prime minister Anthony Albanese’s Aukus announcement expected on Monday. We’ll bring you the latest as it happens… Opposition seeks solicitor general opinion on Voice questions The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, also appeared on Sky News explaining why the Coalition has written to the government seeking legal advice on the proposed wording of the referendum question. Leeser criticised Anthony Albanese for proposing words for the constitutional change at Garma without consulting the solicitor general. The attorney general Mark Dreyfus spoke to the referendum working group on Thursday. Leeser wants to know “what the most senior government lawyer thinks are the issues and challenges with the words the government has put forward”. Leeser defended Coalition questioning of the definition of Aboriginality, explaining there are “a series of different definitions in different pieces of legislation” including the Social Security Act and the Child Care Act. Leeser said the Mabo case test of descent, identification and recognition is generally used, but “the government needs to be specific about what they’re going to use in this body - it’s a question that Australians are asking in fact it’s a question that’s been raised with us by Aboriginal people”. Leeser said that Liberal leader Peter Dutton comes to the issue of the voice “with an open mind” but has been seeking detail that the government hasn’t given (because the detail is still being developed by the referendum working group and by parliament after the referendum). On the referendum machinery provisions bill, Leeser said: [There are] three elements that we wanted the government to address. Firstly, they should never have removed the yes and no case booklet which has been there basically, for every referendum in living memory. And they’ve put that back. Secondly, in an age of foreign interference in which it’s becoming more difficult to comply with the electoral laws, it’s important to have an official yes and no case. And thirdly, it’s very important that both sides are funded. So, that Australians will hear the yes and no case. Leeser said the Coalition had voted against the bill in the lower house, encouraging the government to deal with the opposition to pass it in the Senate with those changes. Australia eyes Indian growth as destination for fossil fuel exports The resources minister, Madeleine King, has spoken to Sky News about Australia’s relationship with India, particularly increasing trade in critical minerals and continuing coal exports. King said that India needed to “diversify its supply chains” by purchasing critical minerals from Australia, adding that they will be “imperative for a net zero [emissions] world”. She said: We need these minerals to go into all the things we need for a decarbonised world ... Each country has to choose its own pathway to net zero emissions, it’s got different conditions. We have a relatively low population. Here in India, there is a billion or more people and many of them still live in situations of energy poverty. They’re not even on the grid. Many also don’t have access to safe cooking fuel. So, you know, the Indian government rightly wants to make their life better and that will depend upon some of the fossil fuels we export. Equally the Indian government is really committed to moving the whole economy to a decarbonised state. They’ve got a commitment for 500, megawatts of renewable energy by 2030. For country. Like India, that is an astounding ambition. But I’ve been in meetings this week in India where everyone is putting their shoulder to the wheel to achieve it. So you know, it would be wrong of us to deny countries like India the energy sources they need to keep their people safe, keep their people able to cook safely, able to have the lifestyle we’re accustomed to. The federal government is gearing up for a major announcement on the way forward for Australia’s $100bn nuclear-powered submarine plans under the Aukus alliance. Prime minister Anthony Albanese left India on Saturday for the US, where he will join president Joe Biden and British prime minister Rishi Sunak in San Diego on Monday for the landmark statement. The three countries first announced the Aukus plan in 2021 as part of efforts to counter China in the Indo-Pacific region, with the US and UK agreeing to provide Australia with the capability to deploy nuclear-powered submarines. Australia is expected to buy up to five US Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines. It has been speculated there will be multiple stages to the plan, with at least one US submarine visiting Australian ports in the coming years and the advent of a new class of submarines built with British designs and American technology. On Saturday, Albanese said the project was also about Australian jobs, particularly shipyard and manufacturing work in South Australia and Western Australia. Asked about the importance of having a second dry dock in WA to complement one in Sydney as the submarines arrive, Albanese pointed to the announcement to come. Asked also about the enormous cost, Albanese said he would explain to the Australian people why it was worthwhile given the deficit hole in the national budget. “Yes, we will,” he said in New Delhi before departing for the US. Australia faces real challenges. We have said very clearly and explicitly that there are major pressures on expenditure, not just in defence, but in other areas as well. – AAP And welcome to another Sunday morning Guardian live blog. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is travelling to meet with President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in San Diego ahead of a major announcement expected on Monday about Australia’s $100bn plan to acquire nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus alliance. Australia is expected to buy up to five US Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines with Albanese hinting at a second dry dock in Western Australia to complement one in Sydney. Residents of Burketown in northwest Queensland are waiting to learn the extent of flood damage with the community’s worst ever flood expected to peak on Sunday. Footage taken from a helicopter above the flood zone on Saturday has shown the town inundated by murky-brown flood waters, with 45 residents having been evacuated to Mount Isa – though some remain.

                    "bodyText": "Australia buying up to five secondhand Virginia class nuclear submarines would not amount to the US “foisting off clunkers” on to its ally, a senior US lawmaker has said. On Sunday congressman Joe Courtney, the ranking member of the house seapower subcommittee and the second highest ranking Democrat on the armed services committee, also sought to reassure Australia that concern about joint crewing of nuclear submarines was “overhyped”. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Courtney made the comments before a joint announcement about Aukus plans for nuclear submarine purchases and development by Anthony Albanese, the US president, Joe Biden, and British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in San Diego on Monday. Australia is expected to buy up to five Virginia class submarines to cover a capability gap in the 2030s before working jointly on a next generation submarine with the UK, evolving from the existing Astute submarine design. The three countries first announced the Aukus plan in 2021 as part of efforts to counter China in the Indo-Pacific region. The US and UK agreed to provide Australia with the capability to deploy nuclear-powered submarines, resulting in Australia breaking its existing contract to buy conventional submarines from France. Late in 2022 two top US senators warned the Biden administration not to sell nuclear-powered submarines to Australia because it would diminish US national security given the vessels are “scarce”. But Courtney said that the US had built 21 Virginia class submarines over two decades, with two more to be built this year, and an increased “production cadence” as the program was “back on track” after a slowdown during Covid. “We don’t have to do this tonight, we’ve really got some runway to stand up these programs and I think it’s going to be a transformational enterprise for working people in Australia,” Courtney told ABC’s Insiders. Courtney also rejected the view expressed by the Democratic senator Jack Reed, chair of the US Senate armed services committee, and the former Republican senator James Inhofe, that the purchase of submarines was a “zero-sum game”. Courtney said he was confident Virginia class submarines could be delivered, citing the fact the US submarine production had “grown and contracted” over decades and had delivered four attack submarines a year and ballistic submarines during the cold war. “Right now we realise we’re going to have to do some more outsourcing … in terms of Australia possibly being a contributor, whether it’s steel fabrication, parts and components.” Asked if Australia is more likely to get new or used Virginia class submarines, Courtney said “when it comes out you’ll see” but assured Australia that “what you will get is of the highest quality”. “The shelf life of a Virginia class submarine is 33 years and it has life-of-boat nuclear reactor, it doesn’t require refuelling.” “No one is going to be foisting off clunkers on good friends and allies.” “China’s missile force is really, in my opinion, the real reason that is driving this decision because surface ships right now are so vulnerable and we saw it in Ukraine where two relatively crude short-range missiles took down the flagship of the Russian navy.” “The surface is really a much more risky place and, unfortunately, a diesel or electric [submarine] which was the prior plan has to exist and operate on the surface.” Courtney said there was “bipartisan” support for Aukus in congress, insisting he wanted to “foot-stomp” concerns “about who is in charge and who makes the decisions”. “There is already existing collaboration between the Australian [and US] submarine forces – I’ve seen it personally and no one questions about who is the decision-maker in terms of how your subs operate.” Courtney said Australian crew will be aboard “Virginia class submarines, but that will be for training purposes, not for operational missions where they are basically saluting US officers”. Albanese has repeatedly reassured that Australia will retain full operational control of nuclear submarines acquired under the Aukus pact despite former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull questioning whether they can they be operated and maintained without the support of the US Navy. Courtney said “the notion that there is going to be joint crewing is really overhyped, honestly”. “I don’t [think there will be joint crewing]. Everyone understands we need to train up the Australian sailors and officers in terms of nuclear propulsion. “And when the time comes for the deed, the title to be handed to the government of Australia of a vessel, that again, it is going to be totally with the full understanding that it is going to be under Australian control.” On Saturday, Albanese said the program was also about Australian jobs, particularly shipyard and manufacturing work in South Australia and Western Australia. Albanese said that government will justify the need to increase defence spending to pay for the Aukus submarine program, expected to cost $100bn. “That’s why some of, frankly, the juvenile response of the opposition to some of the fiscal matters that are before us deserves contempt,” Albanese told reporters in New Delhi."

                    "bodyText": "Sarah Copland, whose two-year-old son, Isaac, was killed in one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history, says the fight for justice has been gruelling. This week marked a small breakthrough for the families of more than 200 people who died in the August 2020 Beirut port explosion, amid accusations the authorities in Lebanon have repeatedly obstructed an investigation. Australia took the lead at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, on behalf of 38 countries, in demanding a “swift, impartial, credible, and transparent investigation” into the port explosion, which also injured more than 7,000 people and damaged 77,000 apartments. A key issue is how more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate had been allowed to be stored unsafely alongside other dangerous materials such as fireworks – and whether authorities had ignored warnings about this hazard for years before the explosion. Copland’s son, Isaac, was eating dinner in his high chair in the family’s home, which was about 700 metres from the port, when the blast shattered the windows. “It means a lot to my family that Australia is not just a signatory, but the leading country on this statement,” said Copland, a UN official based in Melbourne, who is part of a network of families campaigning for an international fact-finding mission. But she said it had taken two and a half years of “persistent and relentless lobbying” by families, in coordination with international organisations, just to secure this week’s Human Rights Council statement. Families had also spent countless hours writing letters, holding meetings, speaking on panels, writing articles, protesting, travelling and more. Copland said all of this work took “a huge toll on us”, but she’s vowed to keep fighting. “I guess for me, my main driver is for Isaac, and for all of the other victims,” she said. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads “As a mother, when he was born, I prepared myself for a lifetime of looking out for him, supporting him, doing everything I could for him. That was cut short and this is my way of being able to continue to do what I can for him. “I think we’re facing an uphill battle, and there’s no guarantee of success. But I think the message needs to be sent that what happened was a human rights violation, it is something that deserves justice and accountability. It’s not OK what happened.” The judge tasked with investigating the blast, Tarek Bitar, suddenly resumed his inquiry in January after it had been stalled for more than a year. But Bitar triggered an immediate row with his decision to bring charges against Lebanon’s most senior prosecutor, two top intelligence officers and a number of other officials for what amounts to obstructing justice. It prompted the prosecutor general, Ghassan Oueidat, to order the release of all suspects. On Wednesday, Australia’s ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Amanda Gorely, read out a statement to the Human Rights Council saying 38 countries were concerned that Lebanon’s investigation had not yet been concluded and had been “hampered by systemic obstruction, interference, intimidation, and a political impasse”. “We urge Lebanon to abide by its international human rights obligations to take all necessary measures to safeguard, in law and practice, the full independence and impartiality of the Lebanese judiciary,” Gorely said. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said the victims and their families deserved justice. She promised to “keep pushing internationally for those responsible to be held to account”. Human Rights Watch welcomed the move as “a significant step in the right direction” by governments ranging “from Australia to Costa Rica to Japan”. Amnesty International said the statement “sends a clear message to the Lebanese authorities that their shameful efforts to impede and subvert the domestic investigation have not gone unnoticed”. Lebanon’s embassy in Canberra said it was not in a position to comment on the matter, but added: “Lebanon appreciates its longstanding and continuing strong relations with Australia.” The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Robert Mardini, said the humanitarian consequences of the explosion were immense. Speaking to Guardian Australia during a visit to Canberra on Thursday, Mardini said hospitals had immediately received a “massive influx of wounded people”. “Beyond the physical scars, which are huge, of this bomb explosion, we should not underestimate the psychological impact it had on the entire country and on its people who have been affected by decades of conflict, instability, economic hardship,” he said. “It came as an additional terrible layer of devastation on a country that has been absorbing a lot of shocks in the past.” Australia’s statement to the Human Rights Council acknowledged Lebanon was experiencing “severe financial and economic crises”. The statement said the 38 signatories wanted a proper examination of the root causes of the “disastrous event” at the Beirut port so as to “prevent the occurrence of a similar tragedy in the future”. Copland said she hoped the statement sent a message to Lebanon “that they can’t continue to obstruct the investigation”. But she remained pessimistic about the prospects of comprehensive action at a domestic level. The next step should be an international fact-finding mission, Copland said. Evidence gathered from such an exercise could be used in domestic criminal proceedings. It could also support lawsuits launched by families and as the basis for other countries to impose sanctions on any individuals implicated. “I’m continuing to urge the Australian government to not make this statement the last thing that they do, to keep pushing to try and get broad international support for an international investigation,” Copland said. “If I didn’t fight, it would be kind of a form of acquiescing and saying, ‘OK, it was just one of these things,’ but that’s not the case. There are people who had the power to stop this from occurring, and they didn’t, and they need to be held to account. “And so I just keep fighting for Isaac, because he deserved so much better.”"

                    "bodyText": "Rishi Sunak will fly to San Diego on Sunday to unveil plans for supplying Australia with nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus scheme amid concerns about the growing threat from China. A major announcement 18 months in the making is expected when the UK prime minister meets his Australian counterpart, Anthony Albanese, and US president Joe Biden. In response to concerns about Beijing’s economic coercion and foreign policy aims, the UK’s defence and security strategy for the 2020s is being updated, and the revised version is due to be published on Monday. It will address “increasingly concerning behaviour” by Chinese president Xi Jinping’s government, the “grave risks” posed by Russia after a renewed assault on Ukraine and “hybrid threats” to Britain’s economy and energy security, No 10 said. Before his trip to California, Sunak hailed “global alliances” – such as the one formed between the UK, US and Australia in September 2021 – as “our greatest source of strength and security”. He added: “I am travelling to the US today to launch the next stage of the Aukus nuclear submarine programme, a project which is binding ties to our closest allies and delivering security, new technology and economic advantage at home.” The UK would be “secure, prosperous and standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our partners”, thanks to the programme and the updated Integrated Review, Sunak said. He will hold meetings on Sunday night and Monday, before flying back home before the budget on Wednesday. The visit threatened to cast a shadow over Sunak’s trip on Friday to Paris, given the French government reacted with consternation to its own submarine deal with Australia being scrapped a year and a half ago. Britain is stepping up efforts to increase its influence in the Indo-Pacific, and Sunak hopes the trilateral summit on Monday will demonstrate his commitment to standing up to China, which senior Conservative MPs have urged him to take a tougher stance on. The Guardian revealed earlier this week that Sunak had expressed delight to fellow ministers about the outcome of negotiations, with multiple sources saying they believed the eight nuclear-powered submarines would be based on British designs. Such a move would safeguard the long-term future of the shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness, since the full fleet may not be seaworthy until the 2040s. Reports this week suggested that the short-term gap could be plugged by Australia buying up to five Virginia-class submarines from the US. Under the three-way deal the US and UK will agree to share secret reactor technology. Australia will become the seventh country to have a nuclear-powered submarine, relying on an enriched uranium reactor – putting its diesel-powered navy on a technological par with China. But it will require Australia, which is not a nuclear power, to be supplied with a reactor, a move that Beijing has argued is a breach of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. The three Aukus powers say that is not the case, and that any reactors will be supplied “welded, shielded and sealed shut”, according to Australian officials overseeing the effort. Charles Edel, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies thinktank, has described the Aukus pact as a calculated gamble. “It’s a bet that by further integrating industrial capacities and increasing interoperability it will significantly augment the capabilities of our allies, make them more powerful, and ultimately change Beijing’s calculations about its security environment,” he said. “And that by doing so, it will help stabilise a region that has been badly destabilised by China’s rapid expansion of military capabilities and increasingly aggressive foreign policy.”"

                    "bodyText": "It is slightly past 8pm in Kyiv. Here are today’s key developments: Russia has bombarded Ukraine over 40,500 times since its invasion of the country last February, according to Ukrainian interior minister Ihor Klymenko. The shelling has destroyed over 152,000 residential buildings since the war began, Euromaidan reports Klymenko saying. Russia has listed the World Wildlife Fund as a foreign agent. According to the Russian justice ministry, the Washington DC-based conservation group, “under the guise of protecting nature and the environment ... tried to influence the decisions of the executive and legislative authorities” and “hindered the implementation of industrial and infrastructure projects,” the Associated Press reports. Russian missile strikes targeted “critical infrastructure” in Zaporizhzhia, the Kyiv Independent reports. The strikes launched on Saturday are likely to have come from S-300 air defence missiles, the outlet reported the Zaporizhzhia oblast military administration saying. Bakhmut has become a “killing zone” that is probably highly challenging for Russia’s Wagner mercenary forces trying to continue their assault westward, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. Its latest intelligence update said that over the past four days, Wagner group forces had taken control of most of eastern Bakhmut, while Ukrainian forces held its west and had demolished key bridges over the Bakhmutka river, “which now marks the frontline”. Three civilians were killed in Russian shelling of Kherson in southern Ukraine on Saturday, and another died in Donetsk, regional officials said. Reuters reported the governor of Kherson oblast, Oleksandr Prokudin, as saying three people, including an elderly woman, had also been wounded. “Today the Russian occupiers have hit Kherson again, on Mykolayivsky road near a shop, debris from a shell killed three people,” he told Ukrainian TV. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, dismissed reports that a “pro-Ukrainian group” carried out a high-profile attack on the Nord Stream pipelines late last year. Speaking to former Portuguese minister Bruno Macaes in an interview with the New Statesman, Kuleba said “it is the first time that I’m hearing a story of a secret pro-Ukrainian or Ukrainian group that is able to conduct operations of that scale and sophistication.” Canada has announced a ban on imports of Russian aluminium and steel products, with the aim of denying Moscow revenues to fund its war in Ukraine. The imports were worth almost C$250m (US$180m/£150m) in 2021, according to the latest government data. Moscow has accused foreign countries of fomenting mass protests in Georgia, likening them to an attempted coup designed to sow tension on Russia’s borders. Agence France-Presse reported that Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said several days of demonstrations in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, reminded him of a Ukrainian uprising that ultimately brought down a Kremlin-friendly presidency in 2014. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, met the Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili on Friday, and they hailed Tbilisi’s dropping of a “foreign agents” bill that had triggered a political crisis in the country. “They welcomed the government’s recent decision to withdraw the two draft laws,” the White House said in a statement. Iran has reached a deal to buy advanced Su-35 fighter planes from Russia, Iranian state media said on Saturday, expanding a relationship that has seen Iranian-built drones used in Russia’s war on Ukraine. “The Sukhoi-35 fighter planes are technically acceptable to Iran and Iran has finalised a contract for their purchase,” the broadcaster IRIB quoted Iran’s mission to the United Nations as saying in New York. The UK government has written to Olympic sponsors urging them to pressure the International Olympic Committee over its proposal to allow Russians and Belarusians to compete at next year’s Paris Games, British media reported on Saturday. The IOC is facing a mounting backlash after setting out a pathway in January for competitors from Russia and its ally Belarus to earn Olympic slots through Asian qualifying and to compete as neutral athletes in Paris, Reuters reported. Most of Kyiv’s power supply had been restored, Ukrainian officials said, after Russia’s latest missile and drone barrage targeting critical infrastructure on Thursday. Power supplies were fully restored in Ukraine’s southern Odesa region, private provider DTEK said, while about 60% of households in Kharkiv city that were knocked off grid were also back online, Associated Press quoted authorities as saying. Significant damage remained in the Zhytomyr and Kharkiv regions in Ukraine’s north-west and north-east. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, made an unannounced visit to Kyiv and met President Zelenskiy on Friday. They attended a service at St Michael’s Golden Dome cathedral in memory of Dmytro Kotsiubailo, a well-known Ukrainian military commander. Thousands of people gathered in Kyiv to attend the funeral of Kotsiubailo. Nicknamed Da Vinci and hailed as a national hero and symbol of resistance, he was killed near Bakhmut on Tuesday, aged 27. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as we wrap up the blog for today. Have a good evening. Russia has bombarded Ukraine over 40,500 times since its invasion of the country last February, according to Ukrainian interior minister Ihor Klymenko. The shelling has destroyed over 152,000 residential buildings since the war began, Euromaidan reports Klymenko saying. Meanwhile, 66,300 criminal proceedings of war crimes committed by Russian forces have been registered since February 2022. Russia has listed the World Wildlife Fund as a foreign agent. According to the Russian justice ministry, the Washington DC-based conservation group, “under the guise of protecting nature and the environment ... tried to influence the decisions of the executive and legislative authorities” and “hindered the implementation of industrial and infrastructure projects,” the Associated Press reports. In response, WWF representatives said the decision was based on unfounded claims. It promised to challenge it in court, and said it would continue to “protect rare animal species and preserve Russia’s nature”. Individuals and organisations listed as foreign agents in Russia come under additional government scrutiny. Since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, scores opposed the war have been designated foreign agents, largely to quash dissent. Russian missile strikes targeted “critical infrastructure” in Zaporizhzhia, the Kyiv Independent reports. The strikes launched on Saturday are likely to have come from S-300 air defence missiles, the outlet reported the Zaporizhzhia oblast military administration saying. The latest attacks come days after the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-eastern Ukraine was reconnected to the country’s energy grid on Thursday after Russian airstrikes in the region. The time in Kyiv is 5.45pm. Here is a round-up of the news stories so far today: Bakhmut has become a “killing zone” that is probably highly challenging for Russia’s Wagner mercenary forces trying to continue their assault westward, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. Its latest intelligence update said that over the past four days, Wagner group forces had taken control of most of eastern Bakhmut, while Ukrainian forces held its west and had demolished key bridges over the Bakhmutka river, “which now marks the frontline”. Three civilians were killed in Russian shelling of Kherson in southern Ukraine on Saturday, and another died in Donetsk, regional officials said. Reuters reported the governor of Kherson oblast, Oleksandr Prokudin, as saying three people, including an elderly woman, had also been wounded. “Today the Russian occupiers have hit Kherson again, on Mykolayivsky road near a shop, debris from a shell killed three people,” he told Ukrainian TV. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, dismissed reports that a “pro-Ukrainian group” carried out a high-profile attack on the Nord Stream pipelines late last year. Speaking to former Portuguese minister Bruno Macaes in an interview with the New Statesman, Kuleba said “it is the first time that I’m hearing a story of a secret pro-Ukrainian or Ukrainian group that is able to conduct operations of that scale and sophistication.” Canada has announced a ban on imports of Russian aluminium and steel products, with the aim of denying Moscow revenues to fund its war in Ukraine. The imports were worth almost C$250m (US$180m/£150m) in 2021, according to the latest government data. Moscow has accused foreign countries of fomenting mass protests in Georgia, likening them to an attempted coup designed to sow tension on Russia’s borders. Agence France-Presse reported that Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said several days of demonstrations in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, reminded him of a Ukrainian uprising that ultimately brought down a Kremlin-friendly presidency in 2014. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, met the Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili on Friday, and they hailed Tbilisi’s dropping of a “foreign agents” bill that had triggered a political crisis in the country. “They welcomed the government’s recent decision to withdraw the two draft laws,” the White House said in a statement. Iran has reached a deal to buy advanced Su-35 fighter planes from Russia, Iranian state media said on Saturday, expanding a relationship that has seen Iranian-built drones used in Russia’s war on Ukraine. “The Sukhoi-35 fighter planes are technically acceptable to Iran and Iran has finalised a contract for their purchase,” the broadcaster IRIB quoted Iran’s mission to the United Nations as saying in New York. The UK government has written to Olympic sponsors urging them to pressure the International Olympic Committee over its proposal to allow Russians and Belarusians to compete at next year’s Paris Games, British media reported on Saturday. The IOC is facing a mounting backlash after setting out a pathway in January for competitors from Russia and its ally Belarus to earn Olympic slots through Asian qualifying and to compete as neutral athletes in Paris, Reuters reported. Most of Kyiv’s power supply had been restored, Ukrainian officials said, after Russia’s latest missile and drone barrage targeting critical infrastructure on Thursday. Power supplies were fully restored in Ukraine’s southern Odesa region, private provider DTEK said, while about 60% of households in Kharkiv city that were knocked off grid were also back online, Associated Press quoted authorities as saying. Significant damage remained in the Zhytomyr and Kharkiv regions in Ukraine’s north-west and north-east. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, made an unannounced visit to Kyiv and met President Zelenskiy on Friday. They attended a service at St Michael’s Golden Dome cathedral in memory of Dmytro Kotsiubailo, a well-known Ukrainian military commander. Thousands of people gathered in Kyiv to attend the funeral of Kotsiubailo. Nicknamed Da Vinci and hailed as a national hero and symbol of resistance, he was killed near Bakhmut on Tuesday, aged 27. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Maya Yang will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Three civilians were killed in Russian shelling of Kherson in southern Ukraine on Saturday, and another died in Donetsk, regional officials said. Reuters reported the governor of Kherson oblast, Oleksandr Prokudin, as saying three people, including an elderly woman, had also been wounded . “Today the Russian occupiers have hit Kherson again, on Mykolayivsky road near a shop, debris from a shell killed three people,” he told Ukrainian TV. Ukraine recaptured Kherson in November after nearly eight months of occupation by Russian forces who seized it soon after the start of their invasion. The area is now under almost constant bombardment from Russian forces on the opposite side of the Dnieper river. The Donetsk regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said one person had been killed and at least three injured in the city of Kostyantynivka after several rounds of Russian shelling during the day. Iran has reached a deal to buy advanced Su-35 fighter planes from Russia, Iranian state media said on Saturday, expanding a relationship that has seen Iranian-built drones used in Russia’s war on Ukraine. “The Sukhoi-35 fighter planes are technically acceptable to Iran and Iran has finalised a contract for their purchase,” the broadcaster IRIB quoted Iran’s mission to the United Nations as saying in New York. The report did not carry any Russian confirmation of the deal, details of which were not disclosed. The mission said Iran had also inquired about buying military aircraft from several other, unnamed countries, IRIB reported. Russian president Vladimir Putin met Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Tehran last July, stressing closer ties in the face of Western pressure over the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported. Iran has acknowledged sending drones to Russia but says they were sent before Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine last year. Moscow denies that its forces use Iranian-built drones in Ukraine, although many have been shot down and recovered there. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, dismissed reports that a “pro-Ukrainian group” carried out a high-profile attack on the Nord Stream pipelines late last year. Speaking to former Portuguese minister Bruno Macaes in an interview with the New Statesman, Kuleba said “it is the first time that I’m hearing a story of a secret pro-Ukrainian or Ukrainian group that is able to conduct operations of that scale and sophistication.” The New York Times reported on 7 March that a “pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines,” citing anonymous US officials who reviewed confidential intelligence. The report added: US officials declined to disclose the nature of the intelligence, how it was obtained or any details of the strength of the evidence it contains. They have said that there are no firm conclusions about it. More recently, German newspaper Die Zeit said the attack had been carried out by a team of five men and a woman using a yacht owned by two Ukrainians and registered in Poland. Speculation over who caused the explosion has been rife since the pipelines were blown up. Early on, Denmark and Sweden were clear that they believed it was an act of sabotage. Russia has accused the US and the UK. Seymour Hersh reported recently that the US blew up the pipes and Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic countries have blamed Russia. Kuleba added that linking the attack to a pro-Ukraine group “causes a lot of damage as it casts a shadow on Ukraine”. He also said he couldn’t rule out the possibility that the attack was a false-flag operation to incriminate Ukraine. He said his government would wait until the results of investigations under way in several countries before reaching an official position on the issue. Russian forces have made progress in the frontline hotspot of Bakhmut, a key target of Moscow’s months-long campaign in eastern Ukraine that has resulted in many casualties, the Associated Press reported. Their assault , however, will be difficult to sustain without further harsh losses, UK military officials said in an assessment on Saturday. The Ministry of Defence said in the latest of its regular Twitter updates that units from the Kremlin-controlled paramilitary group Wagner had captured most of eastern Bakhmut, with a river flowing through the city centre now marking the frontline. It would be “highly challenging” for Wagner forces to push ahead, it said, because Ukraine had destroyed key bridges over the river, and sniper fire from fortified buildings farther west had made the thin strip of open ground in the centre “a killing zone.” At the same time, Ukrainian troops and supply lines in the mining city remain vulnerable to “continued Russian attempts to outflank the defenders from the north and south,” as Russian forces try to close in on them in a pincer movement, the ministry said. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, met the Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili on Friday, and they hailed Tbilisi’s dropping of a “foreign agents” bill that had triggered a political crisis in the country. “They welcomed the government’s recent decision to withdraw the two draft laws,” the White House said in a statement. Zourabichvili, a pro-European who said she would veto the bill, and Sullivan also discussed the need for Russia to feel “the full economic costs of the sanctions, export controls, and other economic restrictions” over its war in Ukraine. In case you missed it, the underwater bombing of the Nord Stream gas pipelines last September was carried out by a team of divers operating from a 15-metre chartered yacht called the Andromeda, according to a report. Der Spiegel traces the Andromeda’s route around the Baltic from its home marina in Rostock on 6 September to the German island of Rügen and then to the Danish island of Christiansø, close to the site of the blasts on 26 September. Experts have questioned whether the amount of explosives used in the sabotage attacks, estimated to be several hundred kilos, as well with the necessary breathing apparatus and other equipment could have been carried on such a small boat, raising the the possibility of another vessel was involved. Canada has announced a ban on imports of Russian aluminium and steel products, with the aim of denying Moscow revenues to fund its war in Ukraine. The imports were worth almost C$250m (US$180m/£150m) in 2021, according to the latest government data. Reuters reports the ban comes as a 200% tariff on Russian aluminium imports announced last month by the United States came into effect, and after the EU already blocked Russian steel products last year. The Canadian deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, said on Friday: Canada, and our partners, have already sanctioned the Russian central bank and capped the price of Russian oil and gas. And now we are ensuring [President Vladimir] Putin cannot pay for his war by selling aluminum and steel in Canada, in coordination with action taken by the United States today. The UK government has written to Olympic sponsors urging them to pressure the International Olympic Committee over its proposal to allow Russians and Belarusians to compete at next year’s Paris Games, British media reported on Saturday. The IOC is facing a mounting backlash after setting out a pathway in January for competitors from Russia and its ally Belarus to earn Olympic slots through Asian qualifying and to compete as neutral athletes in Paris, Reuters reported. The British culture secretary, Lucy Frazer, addressed the letter to the UK chief executives of 13 of the Olympics’ biggest sponsors, including Coca-Cola, Samsung and Visa, outlining the government’s concerns. Frazer wrote: We know sport and politics in Russia and Belarus are heavily intertwined, and we are determined that the regimes in Russia and Belarus must not be allowed to use sport for their propaganda purposes. As long as our concerns and the substantial lack of clarity and concrete detail on a workable ‘neutrality’ model are not addressed, we do not agree that Russian and Belarusian athletes should be allowed back into competition. Ukraine has threatened to boycott the Paris Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes compete. Bakhmut has become a “killing zone” that is probably highly challenging for Russia’s Wagner mercenary forces trying to continue their assault westward, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. Its latest intelligence update said that over the past four days, Wagner Group forces had taken control of most of eastern Bakhmut, while Ukrainian forces held its west and had demolished key bridges over the Bakhmutka River, “which now marks the front line”. The ministry said: With Ukrainian units able to fire from fortified buildings to the west, this area has become a killing zone, likely making it highly challenging for Wagner forces attempting to continue their frontal assault westwards. However, the Ukrainian force and their supply lines to the west remain vulnerable to the continued Russian attempts to outflank the defenders from the north and south. Moscow has accused foreign countries of fomenting mass protests in Georgia, likening them to an attempted coup designed to sow tension on Russia’s borders. Agence France-Presse reported that Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said several days of demonstrations in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, reminded him of a Ukrainian uprising that ultimately brought down a Kremlin-friendly presidency in 2014. Hundreds of Georgians rallied for a fourth day outside parliament, keeping up their calls for a pro-European future, as legislators dropped the controversial “foreign agent” draft law that triggered violent clashes between police and protesters this week. Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and recognised two separatist territories in the north of the country as independent, stationing military bases there after the war. The demonstrations point to turmoil over the future of Georgia, which aims to join the EU and Nato, much to the frustration of Moscow. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. This is Adam Fulton bringing you up to speed. Fighting in the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut had “escalated”, said Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, with another push by Russian forces to break through Ukrainian defence lines that have largely held firm for the past six months. Associated Press reported that just west of Bakhmut, shelling and missile strikes hit the Ukrainian-held city of Kostiantynivka on Friday. The regional prosecutor’s office said eight people were injured and more than a dozen homes damaged or destroyed. AP journalists in the city saw at least four injured people taken to hospital. Police said Russian forces attacked the town with S-300 missiles and cluster munitions. The attacks came as an aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine had decided to continue fighting in Bakhmut because the battle was pinning down Russia’s best units and degrading them ahead of Ukraine’s planned spring counteroffensive. Mykhailo Podolyak’s comments to Italy’s La Stampa newspaper were the latest sign of a emphasis by Kyiv this week on continuing to defend the city after months of bloody battle. In other developments as it turns 9am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv: Most of Kyiv’s power supply had been restored, Ukrainian officials said, after Russia’s latest missile and drone barrage targeting critical infrastructure on Thursday. Power supplies were fully restored in Ukraine’s southern Odesa region, private provider DTEK said, while about 60% of households in Kharkiv city that were knocked off grid were also back online, Associated Press quoted authorities as saying.

The report in Der Spiegel traces the Andromeda’s route around the Baltic from its home marina in Rostock to the German island of Rügen and then to the Danish island of Christiansø, close to the site of the 26 September blasts. Questions have been raised about whether another vessel was involved. The British prime minister has said the war in Ukraine will end at the negotiating table. Rishi Sunak said he would support Volodymyr Zelenskiy to be in the “best possible place to have those talks” and recommitted to providing Ukraine additional military support. Sunak’s comments marked a clear divide with his predecessor, Boris Johnson, in his stance on how the war against Russia will end. Ukrainian officials have ordered a historically Russian-aligned wing of the Ukrainian Orthodox church to leave a monastery complex in Kyiv where it is based, the latest move against a denomination regarded with deep suspicion by the government. The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has thanked Moscow for a “heroic” increase in ammunition production but said he was still worried about shortages for his fighters and the Russian army as a whole. Yevgeny Prigozhin also said on Friday that Wagner had opened recruitment centres in 42 Russian cities. The Kremlin said it saw risks of possible “provocations” in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two Russian-backed breakaway regions of Georgia, after days of protests in Georgia over a “foreign agents” bill. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow was watching the situation “with concern”. The Kremlin regime sometimes issues false warnings about “provocations” for its own propaganda purposes. The newly installed president of Cyprus, Nikos Christodoulides, denounced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, barely 10 days after he assumed power. In his first interview with a foreign TV channel, Christodoulides told Greek state broadcaster ERT that opposing Moscow’s self-styled “special military operation” put his island on the “right side of history”. The International Fencing Federation has decided to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in Olympic qualifying events, sparking outrage in Ukraine. Fencing became the first Olympic sport to reopen events to the aggressor and its ally, one year after their exclusion due to the war in Ukraine."

                    "bodyText": "Last week, I found myself – at the end of a gloomy day – shot through with a burst of fierce, electric energy. It came from watching Sophie Okonedo’s 90 minutes of flat-out fury as she played Medea, opposite Ben Daniels’s Jason, in Dominic Cooke’s production of the Euripides play. Afterwards, I registered the fact that the woman sitting by me had actually put her hands over her face when Medea decided to murder her own children. I, on the other hand, had not. Why did I mentally urge her on towards the unspeakable deeds, inwardly channelling all the pent-up anti-patriarchal rage at my disposal? Wasn’t there something deeply disturbing about that? Or was the play precisely doing its job in Aristotelian terms: providing a catharsis? Medea’s murder of her children is the nuclear button when it comes to punishing her faithless husband, who has cast her aside like an old rag: their sons are the symbol and reality of inherited male power. Since Jason has just openly voiced his fantasy that men might give birth to sons without the need for women at all, there’s a magnificent, if gruesome, logic to her crime. My theatre date quizzed me. She had found Medea a surprisingly sympathetic character … well, for most of the play, and had the script been updated? It had, but not that much: the essentials of Medea’s character were intact, including her immortal words, “It is easier to stand in battle three times in the front line … than to bear one child.” The audience at the premiere, in Athens in 431BC, mostly male, would have received the story very differently. Athenian women, particularly high-born women, were expected to be silent and remain out of sight and mind of men; in public, they would be veiled. The same year that the play premiered, the Athenian statesman Pericles gave a famous speech in which he said that women’s greatest glory was not to be spoken about. It crossed my mind that my friend had once been a correspondent in Afghanistan. What on earth do we do with these strange, knotty, difficult texts from the past? Roald Dahl has nothing on Greek tragedy, and yet we seem always to be coming back for more. Okonedo’s Medea was the second brilliant performance I’d seen in a year, after Adura Onashile’s, for the National Theatre of Scotland, last summer. And then there is Phaedra at the National Theatre, starring a magnificent Janet McTeer. The play, by Simon Stone, who also directs, is “after” Euripides’s Hippolytus, Seneca’s Phaedra and Racine’s Phèdre. Those plays tell of how Phaedra, queen of Athens, falls in lust with her stepson, Hippolytus. After he rejects her, she accuses him, falsely, of rape. I was intensely curious to see how Stone would deal with this storyline. Phaedra’s tale is enormously potent and has parallels in other cultures; for example, the biblical story of Potiphar’s wife. But it’s powerful in a destructive way. It reinforces the patriarchal lie that women, far from being overwhelmingly the victims of sexual violence and abuse, routinely accuse men of rape falsely. If you disagree that a myth like that can still have a foothold in the modern world, I would politely refer you to the alleged statement by Stephen House, a former Metropolitan police deputy commissioner, that the bulk of rape accusations are, in fact, “regretful sex”. (He denies having used the phrase or believing the statement.) For such reasons, I decided not to include the story of Phaedra in my book Greek Myths: A New Retelling. As it turned out, Stone also refused the fence. His Phaedra (renamed Helen) does many terrible things, including causing, directly or indirectly, at least two deaths. But in his version of the story, she does not falsely accuse anyone of rape. “What I have her do in my version is no less heinous,” Stone told me. “But it’s not an act that reduces her to a set of cliches that certain parts of society currently use to try to hinder the essential progress towards gender equality.” Is inventing a rape claim worse than causing people’s death? What are we supposed to do with these stories that take you into a world way beyond the boundaries of the taboo? A couple of weeks ago, I saw another, quite different approach to Greek tragedy, in the Gulbenkian Arts Centre in Canterbury. Several years ago, the playwright David Greig and the director Ramin Gray worked on a hit production, performed in London, Dublin, Manchester, Belfast and Edinburgh, of Aeschylus’s play Suppliants. The story tells of how the 50 daughters of Danaus, forced into marriage with the 50 sons of Aegyptus, flee their homeland in Africa and claim asylum in Argos. What I saw in Canterbury was the second part of the story, the middle play of what originally would have been a trilogy of tragedies. The twist is that only that first, Suppliants, actually survives. Of the second, Egyptians, only a single word remains, and, of the third, little beyond a few lines hymning Aphrodite. So the play I saw was a complete (bar one word) reconstruction. Greig’s idea, a crazy and quixotic one, was to imagine himself into Aeschylus’s shoes and to build the play without modernising, recuperating, softening or reclaiming it. Impossible, of course, but a fascinating quest. The result was mesmerising to watch – a thing that both was and wasn’t Greek. It put me in mind of Ossian, whose poems, purporting to be ancient Gaelic epics, were actually faked by the 18th-century Scottish poet James Macpherson – by which I mean it struck me that in years to come, the play will, like Macpherson’s poems, be more revealing of the moment in which it was created than of the culture it aims to reconstruct. Greig had, I thought, done a good job of being Aeschylean. That is, he had written a play whose likely outcome was the mass rape of 50 women; in which his major female character slits her own throat; and in which the other female character exists solely to uphold the patriarchal values of marriage and family represented by the goddess Hera, whose priestess she is. It’s true that in the next play, which Greig is also planning to write, 49 of the 50 brides murder their rapists/bridegrooms – but Aeschylus was no feminist, and nor, even, was Euripides. I left with a nagging sense of what a strange – and yet intriguing – thing it was to put a play like this into the world when what the world actually needs is space for the untold stories of women and girls. And yet we do need difficult, violent intractable texts such as Euripides’s Phaedra with its false rape claim, because the play tracks us back to the origins of a pernicious narrative, but also because Euripides’s play Hippolytus is otherwise ravishingly beautiful (read Anne Carson’s translation in her volume Grief Lessons). We do need Medea and her horrific child-killing. We need the literature of the past in its spikiness and indigestibility, with its people whom we love and hate, who remind us of ourselves and yet are alien to us. It is one of the few ways we have left of understanding ourselves and other humans in all our destructiveness, and all our deadliness, and all our magnificence.

                    "bodyText": "That’s where we’ll leave our coverage for today. Here’s a recap of the day’s news: Floods are continuing to pose a major threat to north-west Queensland, principally in the outback town of Burketown. The floods, already at record levels, are expected to peak on Sunday. Police have been urging locals to evacuate, saying the area is no longer safe. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has used blunt language in response to the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s concerns about attacks on Hindu temples in Melbourne. Albanese says such attacks have no place in Australia and “we will take every action, through our police and security agencies, to make sure anyone responsible for this faces the full force of the law”. He also used the trip to suggest the two nations could sign a “transformational” trade deal by the end of the year. Sydney’s rail network continued to face chaos due to ongoing repairs, following the complete outages experienced this week. The former prime minister Scott Morrison told News Corp that the formation of Aukus was “the best kept secret in Australian history since the second world war”. Thanks so much for sticking with me and my colleague Henry Belot today. Residents of a north-west Queensland town are reluctantly leaving their water-logged homes behind, while emergency services warn that power is being cut to Burketown due to the flood risks there. Police say the last chance to evacuate is during daylight, though several residents have chosen to stay. Supt Tom Armitt told the ABC that emergency services only had a certain window of opportunity to deploy personnel and equipment such as helicopters. “We don’t know how much ground will be left if the water continues to peak and cover all the ground,” he said on Saturday. “If we get to the stage where we are having to shift and move people to rooftops, that makes a whole different level of complexity. “We don’t know when the peak is expected because it has passed any sort of flood modelling at this stage.” Vision filmed from helicopters over the town shows water covering many buildings to their roofs, with only one or two streets in the centre of the town still untouched by the water. The town is waiting for its worst-ever floods to peak, with multiple communities and outlying cattle properties isolated as heavy rain leaves the state’s west and south at risk of flash floods. The Albert River at Burketown has already surpassed the record 6.78-metre flood of 2011, and the Bureau of Meteorology says waters in the Gulf of Carpentaria community will likely reach their highest by Sunday. A forecast for severe thunderstorms and rain in south-east Queensland was downgraded on Saturday, but heavy falls are still possible. - AAP Parliament House flag with ‘gaping hole’ replaced The tattered flag flying above Parliament House in Canberra has been replaced. This week, the shadow immigration and citizenship minister, Dan Tehan, called on the government to replace the flag, saying it had “a gaping hole in it”. We need to have pride in our institutions, we need to have pride in our parliament and we need to have pride in our flag. The flag was replaced today. Police release vision of Burketown flooding This helicopter vision shows the extent of flooding in the region. Queensland police have told Burketown residents to evacuate before nightfall as the town is no longer safe with rising waters and sewerage contamination. Queensland opposition says domestic violence rates still too high The Queensland opposition has accused the state government of failing to keep women safe following an “alarming” report on domestic violence. The Liberal Nationals’ spokeswoman for domestic and family violence prevention, Amanda Camm, pointed to the release of data this week that showed a 15% increase in breaches of domestic violence orders in the past 12 months: But what was so alarming is the increase in domestic violence orders, and in particular, the breach of domestic violence orders. In the last 12 months we’ve seen an increase of 15% in breaches of DV orders. Camm also accused Labor of failing to implement recommendations that came from the landmark women’s safety taskforce report released almost a year ago. She said the government not appointing a full-time implementation supervisor to oversee reforms to protect women and families from violence had left many people behind. – AAP What will it take to win the NSW election? There’s now two weeks until the NSW election on March 25. If you need a quick refresh on the state of play: Labor needs to pick up nine seats, but if neither major party can get to 47 seats the crossbench will determine the next premier Electoral analyst Ben Raue has this very handy analysis on the upcoming poll: After three terms in power, the Liberal-National coalition government in New South Wales appears to be on shaky ground, falling behind in the polls and currently operating without a parliamentary majority. With two weeks to go until the election, there’s still a chance of the Coalition or Labor forming majority or minority government – although a Coalition majority appears least likely. There are also a number of key contests involving independents or minor parties, adding further complexity. You can read the full story below. Indian PM briefed on Aukus submarine announcement The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has confirmed he briefed his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, on the future of Australia’s nuclear-powered submarine fleet that will be delivered in partnership with the US and UK. As Daniel Hurst reports, the three Aukus countries’ leaders are set to finally announce the details of the so-called “optimal pathway” for Australia to have “at least” eight nuclear-powered submarines. This is expected in San Diego on Monday local time, Tuesday morning Canberra time. The partnership and project has caused some diplomatic angst among regional partners, including Malaysia and Indonesia. Albanese told reporters that Australian government representatives were briefing nations before the announcement. I can confirm that I briefed Prime Minister Modi one on one and I treated him with the respect that he deserved. Briefings are taking place, as appropriate, with other countries. Domestic manufacturing will be reflected in Aukus deal, PM says Anthony Albanese, has been asked about earlier reports that all of the future submarine fleet would be built in Australia, which would deliver a huge boost to manufacturing and jobs. The prime minister says domestic manufacture will be reflected in next week’s Aukus announcement: We’ll make the announcement on Monday, but I will make this point. This is about jobs, including jobs in manufacturing. Adelaide in particular will be a big beneficiary of this announcement as well as Western Australia. This is about building up our capacity and when you talk about the issue of manufacturing submarines in Australia, that’s an absolute priority for us. That will be seen as part of the announcement. Albanese also says the government needs to explain why it is spending billions of dollars on nuclear-powered submarines at a time when other areas of the budget, like health and NDIS, are facing real financial pressures. Australia faces real challenges. We have said very clearly and very explicitly that there are major pressures on expenditure, not just in defence but in other areas as well. That is why the government is working so hard and why the expenditure review committee has been meeting regularly. It’s why we need to be prepared to make some difficult decisions. PM previews nuclear subs announcement before flying to US The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, also used that press conference in New Delhi a short time ago to foreshadow his trip to the US, where he’ll meet president Joe Biden and his UK counterpart Rishi Sunak. As we mentioned earlier today, we’re expecting a major update from the US about the future of Australia’s future nuclear-powered submarine fleet, which will be delivered as part of the Aukus alliance with the UK and US. Here’s Albanese: We will be progressing announcements related to Aukus. The United States and the United Kingdom have historical relationships with Australia going back, of course, a very long period of time. In this century, we have stood side by side in Australia’s time of need but also when the UK or the United States have needed our assistance as well. But this agreement is about the future. It’s about making sure that we invest in our security but also that we invest in our relationships and that is my government’s attitude to foreign affairs and diplomacy. We want a peaceful and secure world. But part of that is investing in our national defence [and] also investing in our relationships. This is not just about dollars. It’s not just about capability. It’s about the way that Australia is seen in the world, [it’s] about dealing with other nation’s diplomatically and treating people with respect. Making sure that our word can be trusted. Hindu temple vandals will face ‘full force of law’, Albanese says The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has used blunt language in response to the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s concerns about attacks on Hindu temples in Melbourne. In January, the walls of the Swaminarayan temple in Melbourne’s north were painted with “Hindustan Murdabad”, meaning “down with India”. Two other temples were also targeted, allegedly by pro-Khalistan separatists The vandalism was condemned by community leaders and many politicians, including the acting state premier at the time, Jacinta Allan, who said was disgraceful to desecrate religious temples. This issue has been on the front pages of Indian newspapers this week. Here’s a quick reminder of what Modi said yesterday: There are reports of attacks on temples in Australia. It’s natural that this kind of news worries people in India, distresses our minds. I told Prime Minister Albanese about these feelings and worries, and he has assured me that the safety of the Indian community is a special priority. And here’s Albanese’s response when asked about this issue at a short press conference, which has just wrapped up. Australia is a country that respects people’s faith and we don’t tolerate the sort of extreme actions and attacks we have seen on religious buildings, be they Hindu temples, mosques or churches. This has no place in Australia and we will take every action, through our police and security agencies, to make sure anyone responsible for this faces the full force of the law. We are a tolerant, multicultural nation. There is no place in Australia for this activity. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is holding a press conference in New Delhi as his diplomatic tour of India comes to an end. He’ll soon depart for the US, where a major defence announcement regarding nuclear-powered submarines will be detailed. Here is Albanese’s preamble. We’ll come to questions in a moment. Can I just thank Prime Minister Modi for the extraordinary generosity that he has shown on this visit. I can’t think how he could possibly have been more open, more generous and more welcoming. Even on the way here to the airport, the signs had changed from ‘welcome’ to ‘thank you for your visit’. Somehow, overnight, they had changed. I was able to spend an extraordinary about of time with Prime Minister Modi and that’s important. Relationships can be built through dialogue and through meetings around tables, but nothing beats sitting down one-on-one, which I did no less than on five occasions with Prime Minister Modi over the last two days. ‘It’s not safe to stay’: police urge evacuations in Burketown Let’s get another update on what’s happening in Burketown, the northern Queensland town that’s inundated with record rainfall and flooding. Supt Tom Armitt, from the Mount Isa police district, says locals must evacuate the town now while it is still possible. We really have increased the seriousness of our messaging today. The waters have risen considerably. About half the town’s houses are impacted by water and we expect that water to continue rising throughout the day. We do not know when the peak is expected, as it’s past any flood modelling we have at this stage. We do have power going out in the town and we know the sewerage is compromised due to the level of water in the town. It’s not safe to stay due to the height of the water and the unsanitary conditions. We really are urging people to leave. NSW firefighters credited for ‘incredible work’ The NSW Rural Fire Service has confirmed a fire near Bathurst in the state central west has now burnt through more than 17,000 hectares. Sydney train passengers urged to delay travel or allow extra time Sydney’s trains are again experiencing major delays on Saturday. Transport for New South Wales is urging commuters to delay travel or allow extra travel time due to urgent overhead wiring repairs at Panania, in the city’s south-west. It is also experiencing issues at Erskineville, in the city’s inner-west. Trains may stop on platforms or between stations for longer than normal while the incident is ongoing. Trains may also have changed stops and leave from different platforms. For service changes, please listen to announcements, check transport apps and information screens while waiting on platforms and on the train. The delays continue after a complete network outage this week, which prompted an apology from the premier, Dominic Perrottet. The shutdown on Wednesday afternoon left tens of thousands of passengers stranded, with Uber fares spiking to hundreds of dollars in surge-price fees. A future Minns Labor government in NSW would need to agree to scrap a major gas pipeline and make all 86,000 pokies cashless if it is to win the support of the Greens, AAP reports. Although Chris Minns has ruled out a deal with the Greens, the minor party on Saturday outlined seven demands it will make if it ends up holding the balance of power in the NSW parliament after the 25 March state election. Top of the list is no new coal and gas projects, meaning the end of Santos’s planned coal seam gas project in Narrabri and a pipeline across the Hunter. The project is on track to be completed in 2026 and is projected to eventually supply half of NSW’s gas. “We cannot afford new coal and gas. It’s deadly, it’s dangerous and it will cost us the earth,” the federal Greens leader, Adam Bandt, told the party faithful in Sydney on Saturday. “Breathtaking” anti-protest laws that lock up grandmothers and students “while the coal and gas companies are given public money to mine, burn and frack our future” would also be on the chopping block, Bandt said. A mandatory cashless gaming card, which is part of the Coalition government’s policy platform, could also prove tricky for Minns, who wants a cashless trial on 500 machines before moving further. “We won’t settle for half-measures and we won’t be fooled by a trial that has been set up to fail,” the Greens lead upper house candidate, Cate Faehrmann, said. The party also wants rent controls and a ban on unfair evictions, the start of a community-led treaty process, hospital-wide nurse-to-patient ratios and real wage increases for the public sector. However, with the potential of teal independents expanding the nine-strong crossbench, Labor will likely have a number of options if it and the Coalition government fail to win a 47-seat majority. Read Ben Raue’s election explainer here: Thunderstorms and damaging winds forecast for parts of Queensland The Bureau of Meteorology is predicting severe thunderstorms over western and southern Queensland on Sunday, including the possibility of hail and damaging winds. SA Health detects invasive meningococcal case South Australian health authorities have confirmed a case of “invasive meningococcal” has been detected in a 28-year-old Adelaide man, who is now in hospital in a critical condition. Here’s the statement from SA Health: The strain has been identified as serotype B. SA Health has identified multiple people who had contact with the patient, of whom two people have been directed to receive clearance antibiotics. There has been one case of invasive meningococcal in South Australia this year, compared to two cases recorded at the same time last year. A total of 14 cases were reported in 2022. The infections are rare but severe and can cause death or permanent disability. Earlier this year, NSW Health issued a similar warning about two cases being detected. Drawing closer to US while seeking warmer China ties leaves Australia with a tough balancing act After 18 months of planning among Australia, the US and the UK, the three countries’ leaders are set to finally announce the details of the so-called “optimal pathway” for Australia to have “at least” eight nuclear-powered submarines. We have had some clues about the outlines of the deal, thanks to leaks out of the US and the UK. It seems Australia could acquire up to five Virginia-class submarines from the US by the mid-2030s before adopting a British design as a more permanent solution. For now, many questions remain unanswered. It’s unclear how much it will cost, how we’ll pay for it, when construction in South Australia will begin and what plans we have in the meantime to invite US and UK submarines to visit Australia for extended periods. The Australian government has argued there is no contradiction between its desire to acquire the best defence assets possible (as part of maintaining a “strategic equilibrium” in the Indo-Pacific) and its continued push for a less rocky relationship with China. But it’s quite the needle to thread. And for all the focus on the precise detail to come, Aukus will clearly be seen overall as Australia drawing even closer to the US and the UK for decades. Queensland police question teen after man found dead A teenager is being questioned after a disturbance in a central Queensland town led police to find a man’s body. The 58-year-old was found dead in suspicious circumstances in a home in Emerald on Friday night, police said. The property was declared a crime scene and an 18-year-old man has been assisting police with inquiries. Emergency services had been called to a disturbance, police said. ‘Don’t click on links’: ACCC warns of latest scam There’s no shortage of scams about at the moment. The federal government is drawing attention to fake live streams of local sport being advertised on Facebook. Here’s the consumer watchdog’s latest warning: Scammers will ask you to register with your credit card to verify your location but then they’ll take your money. Don’t click on links in comments or give your credit card details. Magpies and Power strike deal over ‘prison bar’ guernsey Port Adelaide will wear their historic “prison bar” guernsey in their round three AFL showdown with Adelaide after reaching a long-awaited agreement with Collingwood, as AAP reports. When Port entered the AFL in 1997 they were prevented from using the prison bar jumper, which they wore in the SANFL, amid opposition from Collingwood who maintain the design is too similar to their own guernsey. The Power have since consistently requested to wear the black-and-white striped heritage guernsey in showdowns, but were barred by the Magpies with the former Collingwood president Eddie McGuire stridently opposed to it. Port were permitted to wear the guernsey in round two 2020 as part of their 150th anniversary but had several other requests to wear it knocked back, including in 2021 when players instead changed into the guernsey after a showdown win over Adelaide. Collingwood’s shift in attitude marks a thawing of relations under McGuire’s successor, Jeff Browne, who issued this statement: While we own the stripes in the AFL competition, we acknowledge the history and origins of the Port Adelaide Football Club and their contribution to South Australian football over a long period of time. As president of the club board and following ongoing discussions with Port Adelaide president David Koch, it is our view that we acknowledge the history of Port Adelaide prior to their entry into the AFL and support them to wear their ‘prison bar’ guernsey in their upcoming home showdown against the Crows in round three. Covid-19 could be key to fighting breast cancer Covid-19 immunity and vaccines could be key to fighting breast cancer, according to a researcher who has spoken to AAP. Clare Slaney is focused on improving CAR T-cell therapy – a type of immunotherapy whereby doctors collect a small portion of a patient’s T-cells, which are an important part of the immune system. The cells have the ability to track down and destroy abnormal cells, including some cancer cells, and the therapy has them re-engineered in labs to carry special anti-cancer molecules called chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, on their surface. The cells then rapidly multiply when they are injected back into a patient. The type of immunotherapy has shown great promise for some blood cancers, but it is yet to prove effective for solid tumours like breast cancer. Slaney intends to try collecting people’s new Covid-specific “memory T-cells”, rather than regular T-cells, and re-engineering them to recognise specific breast cancer surface proteins. The coronavirus cells could therefore be used to fight breast cancer, and most people have them given they’ve either had the virus or been vaccinated against it, Slaney said. The initial idea came to me as I was sitting at home frustrated in the early stages of the pandemic, unable to access my lab, watching my colleagues in infectious diseases working so hard to fight the Sars-CoV-2 virus. I suddenly thought can we leverage this virus to do something useful. When the Covid-19 vaccines emerged, I had the idea that we just might be able to use Covid-19 immunity and vaccines to fight breast cancer. The National Breast Cancer Foundation is backing Slaney’s research, announcing funding for the project on Saturday – the three-year anniversary of the pandemic declaration. Liberal senator says Australia may have to ban TikTok The shadow minister for cybersecurity, James Paterson, has said he would be open to a complete ban of the TikTok app due to concerns about privacy and data retention. A growing number of Australian government agencies have begun banning the popular ByteDance app, amid security concerns over the company’s ties to China and what data might be accessible to the Chinese government about TikTok’s users. Paterson told Channel Nine this morning that move was overdue and he’d welcome further action: It should absolutely be taken off all government devices as the United States, Canada, the European Union and many other countries have done. All of those countries recognised the serious national security threat it poses to government users. So that should have happened some time ago. Look, I think we should keep all options on the table on protecting the other millions of Australians who use the app. If we can solve this problem through means less severe than banning it, then I’m very open to that. But I think we have to keep that option on the table because, unfortunately, TikTok is a company that hasn’t told the truth in the past around the way it operates. A TikTok spokesperson has previously said: Just like many private sector organisations, commonwealth government agencies have policies that may restrict the use of social media and messaging apps on devices. In the case of these departments, we understand the restrictions apply to a range of apps and software, not just TikTok. As a global company, we are not unique in how we operate. Some of the best-known and trusted Australian companies, including banks and telcos, openly state in their privacy policies that they share Australian user information with employees and third parties around the world, including China. These organisations often collect sensitive data like financial information, medical records, legal information and more. The TikTok app collects less data than many popular mobile apps. Our community’s safety and privacy is our top priority, and we continue to be diligent in ensuring we meet, or exceed, the data security standards applied to companies that operate in Australia. Police urge Burketown residents to leave ‘as soon as possible’ Queensland police have issued new instructions to anyone in the Burketown area, which is dealing with record flooding after heavy rain upstream. Here’s the alert: Police are strongly urging all remaining residents to leave the community of Burketown as soon as possible. This is particularly relevant to the elderly and people with young children. Sewerage to the town has been compromised and power to the town will be cut off today. It is not safe for people to remain. Residents who have chosen to remain should seek assistance from police. ‘A very good trip’: academic praises Albanese’s tour of India Prof Michael Wesley, the deputy vice-chancellor international at the University of Melbourne, was travelling with the prime minister’s delegation to India this week. He’s told ABC News it’s been a very beneficial trip that will deliver education and business outcomes for both nations. I think it’s been a very good trip. It is buttressed with other Australian ministers that have been visiting. So I was here last week as well for education minister Jason Clare’s visit. That was a very warm meeting where a lot of collaboration was announced, including the mutual recognition of education qualifications. I think the prime minister’s visit has very much continued in that vein. There seems to be a great deal of personal warmth between the two prime ministers. I’m told that the business delegation that the prime minister brought with him (...) had very, very useful talks as well. Australia’s biggest EV show begins in Sydney More than 10,000 people are expected to visit Australia’s biggest electric car show in Sydney today, where organisers will display almost every battery-powered vehicle available in the country, AAP reports. The Fully Charged Live Show will also be the first venue in Australia to show off an unreleased MG hatchback that has been named as a contender for Australia’s cheapest electric car. The motor show, which industry experts say is the first held in Australia in years, comes just one month after consumers set a record for electric vehicle purchases. The Fully Charged chief executive, Dan Caesar, said the company had planned to bring an electric vehicle showcase to Australia earlier but “the pandemic slowed us in our tracks”. Here’s what he told AAP: We’re finally delivering show one now and then we are definitely coming back next year. Typically in year two the show doubles or triples in size. Australia seems to be quite a vibrant place at the moment in terms of talking about solar panels or batteries or EVs. There seems to be some strong demand. Greens senator blasts breastfeeding decision There’s been a lot of controversy about a Victorian judge ejecting a breastfeeding mother and her baby from his courtroom, arguing it was a distraction to the jury. Yesterday, the judge addressed the jury about the incident, saying his comments should be “self-explanatory”. Here’s a reminder of what he said: What I [told the mother] was this – ‘Madam, you will not be permitted to breastfeed a baby in court. I’m sorry. I will have to ask you to leave. It will be a distraction for the jury at the very least’. I am telling you this because it is something that has attracted some media publicity and I think you need to know exactly what it was that I said and why I said it. The Greens senator Larissa Waters has told Channel Nine she’s furious at the judge’s decision. She became the first woman to breastfeed in federal parliament back in 2017. Here’s part of what she told Weekend Today: I can’t believe that we’re still having this debate in 2023 about where mums can breastfeed their babies. If I can do it in parliament, women should be able to breastfeed their hungry baby no matter where they are. That is, in fact, what the law says. I am incredulous that we are still having this debate and that this poor woman, who was just trying to feed her hungry baby, has been made to feel like she has done something wrong. It is an absolute outrage. Labor to tackle noise and venue complaints in NSW Labor will seek to simplify how residents complain about noise and compliance issues from pubs and music venues, and encourage a mediation process instead of fines that punish bars and clubs, if they form government in New South Wales. The reforms proposed by Labor come amid a spate of single neighbourhood complaints threatening the way in which venues across Sydney operate. There are currently seven agencies that can deal with complaints about venues, and Labor plans to streamline this process. If Labor wins government, it will also pay half the cost of soundproofing upgrades to make venues compliant with noise standards. John Graham, Labor’s night time economy and music spokesperson, said music venues “are beloved by their local communities” and that Labor wants “to balance the needs of music venues and neighbours so that we don’t lose these important cultural assets”. He added: More than half the music venues in NSW have closed under the last decade of Liberal government, and more of our best operators are currently at risk. There are currently seven agencies that regulate sound in NSW. Labor will simplify the process so that residents know who to phone if they have an issue and neighbours and venues can peacefully mediate, and we’ll provide practical support to venues for soundproofing. AFL won’t yet commit to AFLW players’ full-time dream Under pressure to outline a “vision” for its elite women’s competition, the AFL remains non-committal on whether it sees the AFLW reaching the point of full-time professionalism, AAP reports. The Carlton chief executive, Brian Cook, last month put heat on AFL officials to produce a long-term strategic plan for the AFLW. It came amid ongoing pleas from many within the women’s game for a future that includes the majority of AFLW players and staff advancing beyond their current part-time status. Players also want the home-and-away season to be expanded beyond the current 10 rounds, to incorporate all clubs playing each of their rivals at least once. Cook queried the AFL’s desire to develop the women’s competition to that point and the league chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, would not commit to it when quizzed on the subject this week. Here’s what McLachlan told AAP: It’s a really interesting question. We want women to be very well paid athletes making a living out of football. But I think we take a line of sight through the men’s competition and one of our bigger challenges is transitioning post-football. Those who have had careers or who have got qualifications or trades in parallel with their football have transitioned in an easier way. We have those learnings and those lessons from the men’s and we’re applying them to the women’s. The pay will grow and the minimum wage now is $40,000 for a 10-round season, but we are very keen to continue to work with our female athletes so they also have an eye to post-football and have a life that contemplates at some point that you have to transition. More trouble for Sydney trains Expect more delays if you’re travelling on Sydney trains this morning. Urgent repairs to overhead wiring are being conducted on the T3 Parramatta line. Earlier this week, Sydney commuters were told to avoid train travel after the entire rail network was halted due to a communications system fault. Commuters reported long delays while returning home from work. Pandemic marriage laws protected LGBTQI people, advocate says Marriage laws intended to give couples more flexibility through the Covid-19 pandemic offer LGBTQI people critical protection from discrimination and persecution, an advocate says. As AAP reports, the Equality Network founder Bronte Price is calling for the Marriage Act to be amended to allow couples to sign notices of intended marriage remotely and have them witnessed by a celebrant over video chat. Existing Covid laws allow couples to do just that but the measure is due to be repealed on December 31. Here’s what Price told AAP: This move to enable a celebrant to witness remotely the signing of a notice of intended marriage needs to be made permanent. It’s not just for the convenience of anyone. There’s still a lot of queer people in Australia who are not out. In a letter to the federal attorney general’s department, Price – a registered marriage celebrant – pointed to one immigrant female couple who crossed the Victorian border from their country town and travelled to Melbourne to have him witness their signing. They did so before the Covid measure kicked in, and out of fear they would be targeted with homophobic remarks if they went to a local authorised witness and “word got around”. The Covid measure would have saved them their anguish, Price said, and the same went for overseas couples who faced much harsher consequences if they were outed. Burketown ranger concerned about crocodiles in flood waters This video and satellite projection give a sense of how bad the situation in Burketown is. Keep in mind, both of these posts are about 22 hours old and the situation has worsened since then. Modi raises concerns about attacks on Hindu temples in Melbourne The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has raised concerns about multiple attacks on Hindu temples in Melbourne during a discussion with Australian counterpart, Anthony Albanese. In January, the walls of the Swaminarayan temple in Melbourne’s north were painted with “Hindustan Murdabad” meaning “down with India”. Two other temples were also targeted. The vandalism was condemned by community leaders and many politicians including acting state premier at the time, Jacinta Allan, who said was disgraceful to desecrate religious temples. Here’s a translation of Modi’s remarks: There are reports of attacks on temples in Australia. It’s natural that this kinds of news worries people in India, distresses our minds. I told Prime Minister Albanese about these feelings and worries, and he has assured me that the safety of the Indian community is a special priority. Aukus the best kept secret since World War II, Morrison says As we mentioned earlier, former prime minister Scott Morrison has spoken to the Weekend Australian ahead of next week’s Aukus announcement about nuclear powered submarines. The long-term plan for Australian submarines would likely involve a British submarine design with heavy use of American technology. That does not preclude a US interim solution to plug a potential capability gap caused by the retirement of Australia’s existing Collins class conventional submarines from the late 2030s. Morrison has been reflecting on the formation of Aukus ahead of the announcement: It was the most remarkably held project that I suspect many could ever recall. In fact, it was the best kept secret in Australian history since the Second World War. This secrecy was so essential because the second it moved outside those who only needed to know, it was a risk. PM highlights education on tour of India Anthony Albanese has been sharing updates of his trip to India on social media overnight, after wrapping up his three-day visit. He’s highlighted education among many other issues. This week, Deakin was announced as the first university with a formal deal to open an international teaching campus in India. Australia could sign a “transformational” Indian trade deal by the end of the year after Anthony Albanese wrapped up his visit to the subcontinent by unveiling a string of agreements, AAP reports. At a joint address in New Delhi with Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, the prime minister revealed the two countries had finalised deals to boost economic and cultural ties. Significantly, Albanese said the nations agreed on an early conclusion to their Comprehensive Economic Co-operation Agreement, adding he was hopeful it would be wrapped up by the end of the year: This transformational deal will realise the full potential of the bilateral economic relationship, creating employment opportunities and raising living standards for the people of both Australia and India. A limited free-trade agreement between the countries came into effect in January but has already borne fruit, with more than $2.5bn worth of Australian produce hitting India. The pair also announced an Australia-India solar task force co-chaired by Australian professor Renate Egan, one tangible outcome from discussions of the need to address climate change. The nations are also set to work more closely on supplying critical minerals as India seeks to meet ambitious goals of 50 per cent renewable energy and 30 per cent electric vehicle usage by 2030. I am proud of the existing co-operation between Australia and India on solar and hydrogen technologies ... and the opportunities for us to work more closely to secure critical minerals supply chains. The task force will provide our governments with advice on opportunities to accelerate solar PV deployment and enhance supply chains. Police prepared for ‘total evacuation’ of Burketown Superintendent Tom Armitt has told ABC News that authorities are prepared to evacuate everyone in the remote Queensland town of Burketown if necessary. As mentioned earlier, the region has recorded record rainfall and flooding. I think we have to plan for the worst case scenario so that we don’t get caught short, so if it means the total evacuation of the town, we will do that. We are prepared for that now. Then it is a matter of being able to continuously monitor the situation and determine when it’s safe to return. Queensland police superintendent Tom Armitt has just provided an update to ABC News on the floods in Queensland. He says 53 people have been evacuated from Burketown. Helicopter evacuations will continue throughout the day. Here’s part of his update: The flood situation in Burketown at the moment is at record levels, so we’re not really in an area where we can predict exactly what we are going to get. We know that the water is still rising and we know that there is a significant amount of water that needs to drain from those catchments, which received an extraordinary amount of rain over the last few days. We do have a fleet of helicopters and other assets that we have used over the last few days to evacuate 53 people from the town. There is probably just over 100 remaining. Some of those people wish to stay in their homes. Others we will be moving today. There has been an absolutely extraordinary response from local helicopter pilots and mustering helicopters to help us move a large amount of people yesterday. Some of these helicopters are only tiny and they only carry three people at a time, so there has been a lot of lifts. Queensland towns prepare for record floods The Bureau of Meteorology has issued flood warnings for many regional Queensland locations. We’ll keep you updated on this story today. Here’s part of the latest update, issued on Friday, which shows how heavy the rainfall has been: Up to 293mm have been recorded across the Nicholson and Leichhardt River catchments in the 48 hours to 9am Friday. Further showers and thunderstorms are forecast for the remainder of Friday, however widespread rainfall has generally eased in the area. Significant river level rises have been observed in the upper parts of the Nicholson and Leichhardt catchment at Riversleigh, Gregory Downs and Doomadgee township where major flooding is occurring. At Doomadgee Township a major record river level of 8.54m was recorded on Friday morning, however river levels are now rising more slowly, and nearing a peak. Record major flooding is occurring at Burketown, with further rises and a record peak likely during Sunday. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage this Saturday morning. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll run through a couple of the top stories making the headlines overnight before my colleague Henry Belot starts up. Anthony Albanese is hoping that Australia will be able to sign a “transformational” trade deal with India before the end of the year as he wrapped up his visit to the subcontinent with a joint address in New Delhi with Indian counterpart Narendra Modi. Albanese said the nations agreed on an early conclusion to their Comprehensive Economic Co-operation Agreement, adding he was hopeful it would be wrapped up by the end of the year. A limited free-trade agreement between the countries came into effect in January but has already borne fruit, with more than $2.5bn worth of Australian produce hitting India. The pair also announced an Australia-India solar task force co-chaired by Australian professor Renate Egan. A northwest Queensland town is waiting for its worst-ever floods to peak, with multiple communities and outlying cattle properties isolated and severe thunderstorms putting the state’s west and south at risk of flash floods. The Albert River at Burketown has already surpassed the record 6.78m flood of 2011, and the Bureau of Meteorology says waters in the Gulf of Carpentaria community will likely reach their highest on Sunday. About 90 locals still in town were told to pack a bag on Friday night after 25 elderly and sick people, along with 18 children accompanied by one of their parents, were airlifted out. Weeks of torrential rain have overwhelmed the region’s rivers, leaving dozens of communities such as Doomadgee, Normanton and Karumba stranded on islands amid a vast inland sea. Those towns as well as more isolated settlements and outlying cattle stations are relying on food and other supplies being sent by air and on barges. The danger of the late-season monsoon has moved south, and a flood watch has been declared for a giant chevron stretching from Julia Creek to the NSW border and back up to Bundaberg. Former prime minister Scott Morrison has reportedly told the Weekend Australian that senior diplomats and cabinet minsters were kept in the dark over Aukus negotiations amid concerns that plans to acquire nuclear submarines from the US and Britain would be leaked through Australian embassies in Europe. “It was the best kept secret in Australian history since the Second World War,” Morrison is reported to have said. The paper says the then Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade secretary, Frances Adamson, was only informed of the deal when it was brought before the national security committee of cabinet in May 2021. Let’s get into it."

                    "bodyText": "Ukraine has decided to continue fighting in Bakhmut because the battle is pinning down Russia’s best units and degrading them ahead of a planned Ukrainian spring counter-offensive, an aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Mykhailo Podolyak’s comments in an interview with Italy’s La Stampa newspaper were the latest signal of a shift this week by Kyiv to continue the defence of the heavily contested eastern city, site of the war’s bloodiest battle. Most of Kyiv’s power supply had been restored, officials said, after Ukraine responded swiftly to the latest Russian missile and drone barrage targeting critical infrastructure on Thursday. In the Kharkiv region, the governor said the energy situation was difficult. “The energy system has suffered significant damage,” Oleh Synyehubov said on Telegram. “Nevertheless, critical infrastructure has already been restored in the city, and water supply has been almost completely restored.” Public transport remained closed. The underwater bombing of the Nord Stream gas pipelines last September was carried out by a team of divers operating from a 15-metre chartered yacht called the Andromeda, according to a news report. The report in Der Spiegel traces the Andromeda’s route around the Baltic from its home marina in Rostock to the German island of Rügen and then to the Danish island of Christiansø, close to the site of the 26 September blasts. Questions have been raised about whether another vessel was involved. Switzerland’s government has said it will not change its longstanding policy banning the transfer of Swiss-made arms to a third country despite growing pressure to export them to Ukraine. The UN nuclear watchdog’s 35-country board of governors has backed the reappointment of Argentina’s Rafael Grossi to a second four-year term as director general, diplomats said. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, has visited Kyiv and met President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. They attended a church service at St Michael’s Golden Dome cathedral in memory of the well-known Ukrainian military commander Dmytro Kotsiubailo. Thousands of people gathered in Kyiv to attend Kotsiubailo’s funeral. Kotsiubailo, nicknamed Da Vinci and hailed as a national hero and symbol of resistance, was killed near Bakhmut on Tuesday, aged 27. The British prime minister has said the war in Ukraine will end at the negotiating table. Rishi Sunak said he would support Volodymyr Zelenskiy to be in the “best possible place to have those talks” and recommitted to providing additional support to Ukraine to ensure it has a battlefield advantage. Sunak’s comments marked a clear divide with his predecessor, Boris Johnson, in his stance on how the war against Russia will end. Ukrainian officials have ordered a historically Russian-aligned wing of the Ukrainian Orthodox church to leave a monastery complex in Kyiv where it is based, the latest move against a denomination regarded with deep suspicion by the government. The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has thanked Moscow for a “heroic” increase in ammunition production but said he was still worried about shortages for his fighters and the Russian army as a whole. Yevgeny Prigozhin also said on Friday that Wagner had opened recruitment centres in 42 Russian cities. The Kremlin said it saw risks of possible “provocations” in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two Russian-backed breakaway regions of Georgia, after days of protests in Georgia over a “foreign agents” bill. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow was watching the situation “with concern”. The Kremlin regime sometimes issues false warnings about “provocations” for its own propaganda purposes. The war in Ukraine is driven by the interests of several “empires” and not just the “Russian empire”, Pope Francis has said in an interview. Speaking to Swiss television RSI, the pontiff described how he had offered to go to Moscow to negotiate peace but had been rebuffed. The newly installed president of Cyprus, Nikos Christodoulides, denounced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, barely 10 days after he assumed power. In his first interview with a foreign TV channel, Christodoulides told Greece’s state broadcaster, ERT, that opposing Moscow’s self-styled “special military operation” put the island on the “right side of history”. The International Fencing Federation has decided to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in Olympic qualifying events, sparking outrage in Ukraine. Fencing became the first Olympic sport to reopen events to the aggressor and its ally, one year after their exclusion due to the war in Ukraine."

                    "bodyText": "The chancellor is poised to announce a £20bn investment in technology to reduce Britain’s carbon emissions at next week’s budget, in a riposte to Joe Biden’s flagship Inflation Reduction Act that aims to create thousands of new jobs. Separately, the government plans to add urgency to Britain’s nuclear programme, with a competition to develop small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Jeremy Hunt will announce a “reset” of government efforts to clean up the UK’s domestic energy supply and safeguard energy security at next Wednesday’s fiscal showpiece, including efforts to create up to 50,000 highly skilled green jobs. Hunt and the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, have been under pressure to respond to Biden’s $369bn (£306bn) of climate subsidies, which have attracted a wave of green investment to the US and away from other countries, including the UK. Although the Treasury has sought to play down the scope for tax cuts and spending increases in the budget, better than expected figures for growth and the public finances have provided the chancellor with some additional financial scope on Wednesday. The Treasury said Hunt plans to announce “unprecedented investment” of £20bn spread over the next two decades into carbon capture and low carbon energy projects and “commit to spades in the ground on these projects from next year”. Carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial activity such as steel and cement production, transporting it, and then locking it into underground storage sites. The move will comes as a relief to developers of a string of carbon capture projects, which have been awaiting government approval. These include the Acorn CCS project designed to support the decarbonisation of two St Fergus gas terminals in Aberdeenshire, and Viking CCS, a 34-mile pipeline that will take carbon from industrial sites on Humberside and lock it under the North Sea. The government hopes to store 20-30m tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030, equal to the emissions from 10-15m cars. Britain has set a legal target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Its attempts to build new UK nuclear power capacity have been beset by a series of false starts including delays and overruns to construction of new plants at Hinkley Point C in Somerset and a lengthy process in finding funding for the proposed Sizewell C power station in Suffolk. On Friday, the government said that Great British Nuclear, its newly formed delivery vehicle for nuclear projects, would run a competition to develop SMRs. The government is investing £210m into the Rolls-Royce SMR project, which has been matched by private sector funding. Rolls-Royce’s reactor design is now being assessed by the safety regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation. However, the government has faced criticism from the nuclear industry at the pace of its decision around SMRs. Britain’s energy system has been under the spotlight since household bills began to rise sharply in late 2021, with further hefty increases after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The government was forced to step in to subsidise bills last year, and Hunt is next week expected to U-turn on a decision to cut support for bills from April. He is thought likely to extend support until July. Hunt said: “We don’t want to see high bills like this again, it’s time for a clean energy reset. That is why we are fully committing to nuclear power in the UK, backing a new generation of small modular reactors, and investing tens of billions in clean energy through carbon capture.” The energy security secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “Already a global leader in offshore wind power, we now want to do the same for the UK’s nuclear and carbon capture industries, which in turn will help cut the wholesale electricity prices to among the lowest in Europe.”"

                    "bodyText": "As the time approaches 9pm in Kyiv, that’s all for today, after the founder of the Russian Wagner mercenary group warned about a shortage of ammunition despite increased production, and Ukrainian cities restored power following a wave of rocket attacks on Thursday. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner mercenary group, said on Friday he had thanked the Russian government for a “heroic” increase in production of ammunition, but that he was still worried about shortages for his fighters and the Russian army as a whole. Prigozhin also said Wagner had opened recruitment centres in 42 Russian cities. “In spite of the colossal resistance of the Ukrainian armed forces, we will go forward. Despite the sticks in the wheels that are thrown at us at every step, we will overcome this together,” he said. Most of Kyiv’s power supply has been restored, officials said, as Ukraine again responded swiftly and defiantly to the latest Russian missile and drone barrage targeting critical infrastructure, Associated Press reports. US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said in its daily update on Thursday that Wagner appeared to be taking a “tactical pause” in Bakhmut. The ISW believes that Wagner is waiting until enough reinforcements of conventional Russian troops have arrived before taking a back seat in the fierce battle. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region, said the energy situation was difficult following Russia’s barrage of attacks on Thursday.

The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said the war in Ukraine would end at the negotiating table. Sunak said he would support Zelenskiy to be in the “best possible place to have those talks”. Ukraine handed suspicion notices to three former senior managers of the aircraft manufacturer Antonov for obstructing the country’s military and allowing Russia to destroy the giant Mriya cargo plane at the start of the war. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, congratulated Xi Jinping after the Chinese leader secured an unprecedented third term as president. In a telegram, Putin said he was sure the two leaders could advance their cooperation on the most important regional and international issues. The Kremlin said it saw risks of possible “provocations” in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two Russian-backed breakaway regions of Georgia, after days of protests in Georgia over a “foreign agents” bill. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow was watching the situation “with concern”.

In his first interview with a foreign TV channel, Christodoulides told Greece’s state broadcaster, ERT, that opposing Moscow’s self-styled “special military operation” put the island on the “right side of history”. Canada has banned the import of all Russian aluminium and steel products in a move aimed at denying Moscow the ability to fund its war against Ukraine. “Ukraine can and must win this war. We continue to do everything we can to cut off or limit the revenue used to fund Putin’s illegal and barbaric invasion of Ukraine,” the Canadian finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, said in a statement, Reuters reports. Here are some photographs of the scenes outside the funeral of Dmytro Kotsiubailo in Kyiv earlier on Friday Here’s a dispatch from Helena Smith in the Greek capital, Athens, after Cyprus’s new president criticised the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Over in Cyprus the newly installed president, Nikos Christodoulides, has gone out of his way to denounce Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, barely 10 days after he assumed power. In his first interview with a foreign TV channel, Christodoulides told Greece’s state broadcaster, ERT, that opposing Moscow’s self-styled “special military operation” put the island on the “right side of history”. “As a country that has suffered something similar, we could not have a different stance,” he said, referring to the 1974 Turkish invasion, which saw the northern third of the island being seized by troops sent in by Ankara. The invasion was ordered after Greek rightwingers staged a coup aimed at uniting the Mediterranean country with Greece – a move that prompted Ankara to invade in the name of protecting the island’s Turkish Cypriot community. Talks aimed at reuniting the island have repeatedly foundered ever since. Before last year’s invasion, Greek Cypriots enjoyed strong ties with Russia, so much so that the island had earned the moniker of “Moscow on the Med”. Limassol, the republic’s second-largest city, has long been home to a flourishing Russian community including companies closely connected to allies of Putin. The extent of the ties are such – economically, politically and culturally – that the new president’s predecessor, Nicos Anastasiades, hesitated condemning the invasion last February. Cyprus’s about–turn as an EU member state has incensed Russia, as has that of Athens. Unlike Greece, Cyprus is not a Nato member. As a member of the alliance, Greece has not only criticised the invasion but allowed US bases on its soil to be used to deliver weapons, including tanks, to Ukraine. Hours before the ERT interview was aired, Moscow’s ambassador to Cyprus, Murat Zyazikov, a former KGB operative and close Putin ally, told Russia’s state-run news agency he believed relations between the two countries were still strong despite “temporary political adventures”. In a noticeable change of tone that may speak to Moscow’s increasing sense of isolation, Zyazikov said: “I’d like to stress that the people of Cyprus were, are, and will always remain friendly with us. These are not just words … The friendship between our two peoples is based on mutual feelings of affinity between common people, on the close historic, spiritual and cultural relations between our two countries over centuries. I don’t think that any temporary political adventures can hurt this friendship.” Most of Kyiv’s power supply has been restored, officials said on Friday, as Ukraine again responded swiftly and defiantly to the latest Russian missile and drone barrage targeting critical infrastructure, Associated Press reports. In what has become a familiar Russian tactic since early October, the Kremlin’s forces struck Ukraine from a distance on Thursday while the ground battles in the country’s east largely remained mired in a grinding stalemate. The apparent aim of attacking power stations and other infrastructure is to weaken Ukraine’s resolve and compel the Ukrainian government to negotiate peace on Moscow’s terms. Ukrainian authorities scrambled to counter the consequences of the latest bombardment, part of a recurring cycle of urban smash-and-repair that has brought little change in the course of the war, which recently entered its second year. The Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said the Russians were striking civilian infrastructure because they could not efficiently target Ukrainian military assets. “The Russians lack data about the location of Ukrainian troops and weapons, so they are targeting civilian infrastructure and using the same old methods of attacking civilians to sow fear and panic in the society,” he said. “Ukraine has survived the winter and Russia’s strikes on the energy system in the spring hardly make any sense.” Power and water were restored in Kyiv, said Serhiy Popko, the head of the city’s military administration. Popko said that about 30% of consumers in the capital remained without heating and that repair work was continuing. The electricity supply was restored to more than nine in 10 consumers in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region, local officials said, while power was also restored to a third of consumers in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region. In another sign of normality quickly returning, Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, made an unannounced visit to Kyiv on Friday. Marin echoed other western leaders who have accused Russia of war crimes in Ukraine and said Russian soldiers and leaders would be held accountable in a courtroom. “Putin knows he will have to answer for his crime of aggression,” the Finnish leader said during a news conference. “The future tribunal must bring justice efficiently and answer Ukrainians’ rightful demands.” Thousands of people gathered in Kyiv on Friday to attend the funeral of the well-known Ukrainian military commander Dmytro Kotsiubailo, nicknamed ‘’Da Vinci’’ and hailed as a national hero and symbol of resistance. Kotsiubailo, who in 2021 was awarded the top military honour of the Order of the Golden Star by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, giving him the title “Hero of Ukraine”, died near Bakhmut on Tuesday at the age of 27. In 2014, he was seriously wounded by a tank shell in Pisky, Donetsk oblast. ‘’After recovery and three months of rehabilitation, he returned to the front, where he continued to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” the Ukrainian armed forces said. St Michael’s Golden Dome Cathedral reached full capacity owing to the large number of mourners who arrived from several regions to pay their last respects and bring flowers. As a result, hundreds of people were forced to attend the funeral from the courtyard outside the church. After the ceremony at the cathedral, a military procession carried his casket to the Maidan (Independence Square) for a larger public memorial. In 2016, Kotsiubailo became the youngest commander in the history of the Ukrainian army. Zelenskiy attended the funeral at the church as well, alongside Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, who is the latest foreign leader to visit Kyiv. “One of the youngest heroes of Ukraine. One of those whose personal history, character and courage have forever become the history, character and courage of Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said. More than a year after the beginning of the war, the Ukrainian resistance continues to seek examples to boost the morale of its troops grappling with the bloody and uncertain battle of Bakhmut. On Tuesday, the Servant of the People party announced it had sent an appeal to Zelenskiy to posthumously grant the title of Hero of Ukraine to another soldier, the Ukrainian prisoner of war shot dead by Russian troops in a graphic 12-second clip that spread quickly across Ukraine and much of the world. The video, allegedly posted to Telegram by Russian soldiers on Monday, has led to a war crimes investigation and, within Ukraine, contention over the man’s identity, which has not yet been conclusively established because of the low quality of the video. As a result, two families, two battalions and two different home towns have each to varying degrees claimed the man as their own. Military authorities are considering exhuming a soldier’s body in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner mercenary group, said on Friday he had thanked the Russian government for a “heroic” increase in production of ammunition, but he was still worried about shortages for his fighters and the Russian army as a whole. Prigozhin also said Wagner had opened recruitment centres in 42 Russian cities. “In spite of the colossal resistance of the Ukrainian armed forces, we will go forward. Despite the sticks in the wheels that are thrown at us at every step, we will overcome this together,” he said. Reuters reports Prigozhin said his men had started to receive ammunition deliveries labelled as produced in 2023. He said ammunition was now being produced “in huge quantities, which cover all the necessary needs”. In the same audio message he also expressed concerns by saying: “I am worried about ammunition and shell shortages not only for the Wagner private military company but for all units of the Russian army.” Switzerland’s government said on Friday it will not change its longstanding policy banning the transfer of Swiss-made arms to a third country despite growing pressure from countries to export them to Ukraine. “The federal council is committed to the values of Swiss neutrality and will continue to work to ensure the benefits of neutrality are realised,” Reuters report it said in a statement. The Russian state-owned news agency, Tass, is reporting more words from Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, this time about Georgia and Moldova. In particular, Lavrov accused the west of hypocrisy in its attitude to the situations. Tass quotes Lavrov as saying on Russian television that “in Moldova protests against the current government are condemned”, but that the west is supporting protest in Georgia “because the opposition in Georgia reflects western interests, and the opposition in Moldova reflects other interests”. He put the blame on demonstrations in Georgia on outside interests, saying: “Events in Georgia, of course, are orchestrated from outside. This is the same desire to create an irritant on the borders of Russia.” Lavrov compared the situation to Ukraine in 2013, saying: “Moreover, the irritant in a country where the current government, just like the government of [ex-president of Ukraine Viktor] Yanukovych in 2013, thinks primarily about the economic interests of the country and refuses to join anti-Russian sanctions. Motivating not at all by the fact they are pro-Russian politicians, but by the fact of their economic and trade relations with the Russian Federation.” Also from the journey to the summit in Paris, the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said the war in Ukraine will end at the negotiating table. Sunak said he would support president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to be in the “best possible place to have those talks”. While the prime minister indicated that now is not the time for those peace talks, he recommitted to providing additional support to Ukraine to ensure they have an advantage on the battlefield. Sunak’s comments on his way to the first UK-France summit in five years, marked a clear divide in stance on how the war against Russia will end from that of his predecessor Boris Johnson. The former prime minister heaped pressure on Sunak, urging the UK to send jets and tanks to help Ukraine “finish the job”. Speaking on the Eurostar to Paris hours before meeting his “friend” Emmanuel Macron, Sunak said: “We’re providing training to use those capabilities. That’s all under way, as well as just helping defend themselves against the attacks that they’re facing, particularly on their critical national infrastructure. Now, that should be everyone’s focus. “Of course, this will end, as all conflicts do, at a negotiating table, but that is a decision for Ukraine to make. And what we need to do is put them in the best possible place to have those talks at an appropriate moment that makes sense for them. “But at the moment, the priority has got to be giving them the resources the training and the support they need to push forward and create advantage on the battlefield.” Security in Europe is “intertwined” with peace in the Indo-Pacific, the UK prime minister has said, as he warned China to stay out of Ukraine-Russia conflict. During the UK-France summit in Paris, Rishi Sunak and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, are expected to unveil a plan for increased allied activity in the Indo-Pacific. No 10 said it will include establishing France and the UK as the “backbone” to a permanent European maritime presence there. The approach will include coordinating regular deployment of France’s Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier and the UK’s HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales carriers across the region. Sunak, speaking to reporters on board the Eurostar to the summit, according to PA Media, said Paris and London were aligned when it came to their approach to the Indo-Pacific, with both declaring they want to be “active participants in the region”. Sunak confirmed he and Macron wanted to stress to China and other countries “not to be providing support to Russia” after its invasion of Ukraine. The prime minister said he would be discussing the west’s approach to Beijing before the French president’s visit to China, a trip he said was due to happen soon. He said: “One thing that we’ve talked about previously in our G7 meetings as well, is a) about our collective economic security, but also ensuring that, as we support Ukraine, part of that is making sure that other countries – we’d urge all countries not to be providing support to Russia, or trying to circumvent sanctions.” Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, is the latest foreign leader to visit Kyiv, and has met the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Friday morning. They attended a church service at St Michael’s Golden Dome Cathedral in memory of soldier Dmytro Kotsiubaylo who was killed near Bakhmut on Tuesday. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said that a conversation with US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on the sidelines of the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in New Delhi last week was “constructive”. In an interview on Russian state TV he said he heard nothing new from the U.S. side. Lavrov said the pair spoke for 10 minutes and discussed nuclear arms issues and the conflict in Ukraine. It was the first meeting between the pair since Russia invaded Ukraine last February. “We spoke constructively, without emotions, we shook hands,” Lavrov said. “Everything I heard was a position that has already been expressed and underlined in public many times before. I gave my honest, detailed assessment about the New Start treaty, and why we saw it necessary to suspend it,” he said. President Vladimir Putin suspended the New Start nuclear arms treaty last month, accusing the United States of trying to inflict a “strategic defeat” on Russia in Ukraine. Russia said on Friday it was still in contact with Washington over the treaty, but held out little prospect of returning to it. The private mercenary group Wagner appears to be taking a “tactical pause” in Bakhmut, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said in its daily update. The ISW believes that Wagner is waiting until enough reinforcements of conventional Russian troops have arrived before taking a backseat in the fierce battle. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has said the energy situation is difficult after Russia’s barrage of attacks on Thursday. In a message on Telegram, he said “the energy system has suffered significant damage. Nevertheless, critical infrastructure has already been restored in the city, and water supply has been almost completely restored”. However, public transport remains closed. The UN nuclear watchdog’s 35-nation board of governors on Friday backed the reappointment of Argentina’s Rafael Grossi to a second four-year term as director general, diplomats at the closed-door meeting said. Ukraine handed suspicion notices on Friday to three former senior managers of the aircraft manufacturer Antonov for obstructing the country’s military and allowing Russia to destroy the giant Mriya cargo plane at the start of the war. Russian president, Vladimir Putin, congratulated Xi Jinping on Friday after the Chinese leader secured an unprecedented third term as president. In a telegram, Putin said he was sure the two leaders could advance their cooperation on the most important regional and international issues The Kremlin said on Friday it sees risks of possible “provocations” in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two Russian-backed breakaway regions of Georgia, after days of protests in Georgia over a “foreign agents” bill. Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that Moscow was watching the situation “with concern”. The war in Ukraine is driven by the interests of several “empires” and not just the “Russian empire”, Pope Francis said in an interview published on Friday. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Harry Taylor will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. The UN nuclear watchdog’s 35-nation board of governors on Friday backed the reappointment of Argentina’s Rafael Grossi to a second four-year term as director general, diplomats at the closed-door meeting said. Reuters reports the decision was a formality since there was no challenger. The International Atomic Energy Agency’s board approved his reappointment by acclamation, meaning that no vote was held and no country expressed opposition, diplomats said. The decision is subject to approval by the IAEA’s general conference, an annual meeting of all member states held in the autumn. The general conference is expected to approve it. Grossi’s current term ends in December. Earlier this week Grossi was vocal about the dangers posed by military action around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine which has been occupied by Russia since the earliest days of the war, and which on six occasions has become disconnected from external power and had to rely on emergency generators, raising the risk of an accident. Ukraine handed suspicion notices on Friday to three former senior managers of the aircraft manufacturer Antonov for obstructing the country’s military and allowing Russia to destroy the giant Mriya cargo plane at the start of the war. Reuters report the prosecutor general’s office and the SBU security service said the former officials prevented the Ukrainian national guard from building fortifications at a key airport on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv in January to February last year as the threat of Russia’s full-scale invasion loomed. The SBU and prosecutors said in statements that two of the suspects were detained and the former general director of Antonov was declared a wanted person. The suspects, who were not named, could face up to 15 years in prison. A notice of suspicion indicates to the recipient they are a person under investigation by law enforcement. The Kremlin said on Friday it sees risks of possible “provocations” in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two Russian-backed breakaway regions of Georgia, after days of protests in Georgia over a “foreign agents” bill. Georgia’s parliament on Friday dropped plans for the legislation, which had triggered three consecutive days of huge street protests in the capital Tbilisi. Reuters reports the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that Moscow was watching the situation “with concern”. My colleague Pjotr Sauer has a useful explainer here on the situation in Georgia: Why did protesters in Georgia oppose the ‘Russian law’ bill? An air alert has again been declared in southern Ukraine, covering Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has posted to his Telegram channel a clip of him being interviewed, in which he discusses the current energy situation. He writes: The situation with energy supply in Kharkiv is difficult, because the energy system has suffered significant damage. Nevertheless, critical infrastructure has already been restored in the city, and water supply has been almost completely restored. The region is more than 90% healed. Electric transport does not yet have enough voltage and does not work. The energy industry is working hard to fully restore the energy supply. The air alarm that has been in place in Ukraine for just over an hour and 15 minutes has ended. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has said on Telegram that 892 people left for Przemyśl in Poland yesterday, with a further 55 internally displaced people arriving in his region on evacuation trains from the east of Ukraine during the day. Here are some of the latest images from Ukraine sent to us over the news wires. Suspilne’s morning news bulletin has been published on its official Telegram channel. Ukraine’s state broadcaster reports: At night, Russian troops hit the Nikopol district of the Dnipropetrovsk region with rockets and artillery. As a result of one of the hits, there was significant destruction of the energy facility, three settlements were left without electricity. There are no victims. Heat supply continues to be restored in Kyiv after yesterday’s shelling: as of this morning, 30% of houses remain without heating, the local authority reported. The entire Kharkiv region, except for a few communities, has already recovered power. There may be outages during the day. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, congratulated Xi Jinping on Friday after the Chinese leader secured an unprecedented third term as president. Reuters reports that in a telegram to Xi, Putin said he was sure the two leaders could advance their cooperation on the most important regional and international issues, the Kremlin said. “I am confident that, working together, we will ensure the expansion of fruitful Russian-Chinese cooperation in various fields,” Putin said to Xi. An air raid alert has been declared across Ukraine. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that Znob-Novhorodske in the Sumy region in Ukraine’s north-east was struck six times overnight by mortar fire. It states that no damage or casualties have been reported by the local authority. The claim has not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. The UK Ministry of Defence said the death toll from yesterday’s mass strikes stands at 11, which is two more people than the last update on Thursday from emergency services. The ministry cites Ukrainian officials. The Guardian columnist Rafael Behr has written this opinion piece on the Russian dissenters we must not forget: Last April, Masha Moskaleva, a 12-year-old girl from the Tula region south of Moscow, drew a picture in her school art class that upset the teacher. The teacher ran to the head; the head called the police; the police told the FSB, Russia’s state Security Service, which interrogated Masha. Her father, a single parent, was arrested, beaten, fined and placed under house arrest. His daughter was taken into state care. Moskaleva’s crime was “discrediting the military” – an offence passed into law after the invasion of Ukraine to criminalise dissemination of the truth. It carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Masha’s picture showed a woman and child, hand in hand, next to a Ukrainian flag. Missiles fly towards them from a Russian flag, on which is written “No to war”. Those words alone – net voine in Russian – are sufficient to trigger criminal prosecution. And not just the words. You can be arrested for holding a sign that merely hints at the slogan with asterisks – *** *****. When a repressive state’s demand for ideological uniformity meets the human capacity for free thought, the result is terror but also absurdity. As the gap between official versions of the truth and reality widens, the central power insists on ever more grotesque levels of acquiescence. Passive obedience is no longer sufficient. Citizens must abase themselves with displays of loyalty. Masha Moskaleva’s art teacher had not asked the class to draw just any picture. The instruction was to produce something celebrating the “special military operation” in Ukraine. The demand for performance of ideology, not mere submission, signals the path from authoritarian to totalitarian government trodden by Vladimir Putin’s regime since the invasion of Ukraine. The war in Ukraine is driven by the interests of several “empires” and not just the “Russian empire”, Pope Francis said in an interview published on Friday. Francis said the conflict was fuelled by “imperial interests, not just of the Russian empire, but of empires from elsewhere”. The pontiff was speaking to the Italian Swiss television channel RSI, in an interview due to be broadcast on Sunday. It is unclear what exactly Pope Francis meant by his comments. The graphic 12-second clip spread quickly across Ukraine. A Ukrainian prisoner of war, unarmed, is derided by his Russian captors, who are recording the scene. He calmly puffs on his cigarette, looks his tormentors in the face and says: “Glory to Ukraine.” Within an instant, multiple shots can be heard. He slumps dead to the ground. The video, allegedly posted to Telegram by Russian soldiers on Monday, has led to a war crimes investigation and, within Ukraine, a battle over the identity of a man hailed as a national hero and symbol of resistance. Two families, two battalions and two different home towns have each to varying degrees claimed the man as their own. Military authorities, to resolve the dispute, are considering exhuming a soldier’s body. At stake is not just a posthumous medal for valour, but the pride of claiming a figure to whom mayors and cities across Ukraine are already preparing to dedicate monuments and streets. The final verdict will not bring the prisoner back to life, but it will write his name into Ukrainian history: Private mercenary group Wagner appears to be taking a “tactical pause” in Bakhmut, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said in its daily update a short while ago. The ISW believes that Wagner is waiting for until enough reinforcements of conventional Russian troops have arrived before taking a backseat in the fierce battle – the most violent fight of the war. “The arrival of an increased number of conventional #Russian forces to the area may suggest that Russian forces intend to offset the possible culmination of #Wagner’s offensive operations in #Bakhmut with new conventional troops,” the ISW said. Provt Hello, this is the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next while. The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, says that Wagner forces appear to have “entered a temporary tactical pause” in the fierce battle for Bakhmut. Wagner may be waiting for reinforcements of Russian troops to arrive, the ISW said. “It remains unclear if Wagner fighters will retain their operational preponderance in future #Russian offensives in the city.” We’ll have more from Bakhmut shortly. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments: Russia unleashed its largest missile bombardment against Ukraine in three weeks in the early hours of Thursday, including six hypersonic missiles able to evade air defences. At least nine civilians were reported killed. Critical infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions were hit, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. “The occupiers … won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done.” At least six of the dead were killed in a strike on a residential area in the western Lviv region, 700km (440 miles) from the frontline, Ukrainian emergency services said. Three buildings were destroyed by fire after the missile attack and rescue workers were combing through rubble looking for more possible victims. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. The attacks also briefly disconnected Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant from the grid. Ukraine said the Zaporizhzhia plant was forced on to emergency diesel power to prevent a meltdown. It was later reconnected to Ukraine’s energy grid, operator Ukrenergo said. The UN’s nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the Zaporizhzhia plant’s safety and security. Russia’s defence ministry said it had carried out a “massive retaliatory strike” as payback for a cross-border raid last week. It claimed to have hit all its intended targets, destroying drone bases, disrupting railways and damaging facilities that make and repair arms. Ukrainian authorities insist they will continue to try to hold the eastern city of Bakhmut, despite suffering an estimated 100-200 casualties a day. Ukraine’s national security chief, Oleksiy Danilov, has said that one Ukrainian is killed for every seven Russians, and claimed that Ukrainian soldiers are killing as many as 1,100 Russians a day. Western officials have estimated Russian casualties in Bakhmut at 20,000-30,000. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass claims security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria have foiled an assassination attempt on its internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Tass reported Transnistria’s security forces claimed Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has reportedly been snubbed by the Oscars for the second year in a row. According to Variety, Zelenskiy had been hoping to appear on this Sunday’s telecast following on from previous cultural appearances but the request has been denied. Ukraine will take part in a European Union scheme to jointly buy gas in global markets, to procure 2bn cubic metres of the fuel ahead of next winter, the EU energy policy chief said. Belarus’s authoritarian president has signed a bill introducing capital punishment for state officials and military personnel convicted of high treason. The amendments to the country’s criminal code endorsed by President Alexander Lukashenko envisage death sentences for officials and service personnel who cause “irreparable damage” to Belarus’s national security through acts of treason. Russia has introduced personal sanctions against 144 government officials, journalists, lawmakers and other public figures from the three Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – deemed “most hostile” to Moscow."

                    "bodyText": "Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. The battle for Bakhmut rages as death toll rises Ukrainian authorities insisted they would continue to try to hold the eastern city of Bakhmut, in what has become one of the longest and bloodiest battles since the war began. Despite continuing rumours that a Ukrainian retreat is imminent, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy instructed the army to bolster the defence of the city, even as the death toll rises. Isobel Koshiw and Pjotr Sauer reported that Ukraine was suffering an estimated 100-200 casualties a day. Andriy, a deputy commander in the Donetsk region whose battalion is fighting in the Bakhmut area, told them that “positions are ready [for them] to retreat to. The reason they are still there is more of a political thing.” On the other side, a Moscow-based analyst with links to Russia’s ministry of defence estimated that 6,000-8,000 Russian troops had been killed, predominantly recently recruited convicts. However, the analyst noted it was very difficult to be precise because the “brunt” of the fighting was being carried out by Wagner mercenary forces. “Wagner doesn’t always retrieve the bodies of its fighters, while many of the former convicts fighting are not properly registered,” he said, on condition of anonymity. Despite the brutal conflict, many civilians remain in Bakhmut. Peter Beaumont met a police major who was attempting to persuade those caring for children to let them be evacuated. It is a search that has led to rumours that police are taking children from parents who refuse to leave, which has prompted some families to hide their sons and daughters, inexplicable as that might seem. “But it’s not correct,” the officer said. “The law says we can only take children with permission of the parents. If the children don’t have parents but have a guardian, we can get permission from social services to take them out.” Ukraine said on Tuesday that about 4,000 civilians had been killed in Bakhmut during Russia’s assault. Russia launches largest missile barrage in weeks At least nine people were reported killed on Thursday after Russia unleashed its largest missile bombardment against Ukraine in three weeks. Critical infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions across the country were hit. At least six of the dead were killed in a strike on a residential area in the western Lviv region, 700km from the frontline, Ukrainian emergency services said. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Six hypersonic missiles, able to evade air defences, were among those launched. Lorenzo Tondo in Kyiv reported that the attacks also briefly disconnected the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s biggest – from the grid. The UN’s nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the plant’s safety and security. Pro-Ukraine group may have sabotaged Nord Stream European and US intelligence officials obtained tentative intelligence to suggest a pro-Ukrainian saboteur group may have been behind the bombing of the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year, according to reports in the New York Times and German newspaper Die Zeit. German investigators believe the attack on the pipelines was carried out by a team of six people, using a yacht that had been hired by a company registered in Poland and owned by two Ukrainian citizens, according to Die Zeit. Dan Sabbagh, Philip Oltermann and Lorenzo Tondo reported that the information was shared between European intelligence agencies in an effort to establish more information about those who carried out the undersea bombings in September, an attack that had left western governments perplexed. Details about the intelligence remains sketchy and it is unclear what confidence the US intelligence community places in the theory, as well as who may have organised, funded and directed such a daring attack on the gas pipelines running between Russia and Germany. But it is suggested that the government of Kyiv did not direct the underwater strike. An unarmed PoW was allegedly shot dead by Russians Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to “find the murderers” of an unarmed Ukrainian prisoner of war apparently shot dead by Russian troops in footage that spread rapidly across social media on Monday. In the graphic 12-second clip that first circulated on Telegram and was widely shared on Twitter, a detained combatant, named by the Ukrainian military as Tymofiy Mykolayovych Shadura, is seen standing in a shallow trench smoking a cigarette. The soldier, in uniform with a Ukrainian flag insignia on his arm, says “Glory to Ukraine” and is then apparently shot with automatic weapons. Lorenzo Tondo and Pjotr Sauer reported this story. Ukraine urged the international criminal court to investigate the footage. ‘Foreign agent’ law stirs anti-Russian sentiment in Georgia After two nights of widespread, violent protests, Georgia’s ruling party withdrew a draft law that had drawn comparisons with a 2012 law in Russia that has since been used to crack down on dissent and suppress western-funded NGOs and media. Pjotr Sauer reported that the proposed “foreign agent” bill faced criticism that it would limit press freedom and undercut the country’s efforts to become a candidate for European Union membership. Across two nights hundreds of police, many carrying riot shields, used water cannon and teargas in clashes in Georgia’s capital. More than 100 protesters were arrested during this week’s protests. Thousands had marched in the streets to rally against the proposed law that would require any organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from overseas to register as “foreign agents” or face substantial fines. Speaking on Wednesday evening as the protests were continuing, Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for “democratic success” in Georgia and voiced gratitude for Georgian support for Ukraine. “There is no Ukrainian who would not wish success to our friendly Georgia. Democratic success. European success,” he said. Rightwing Republicans rail against US aid for Ukraine Marjorie Taylor Greene, an influential far-right Republican in the US Congress, called for the US to stop aid to Ukraine, David Smith wrote, giving added voice to a grassroots revolt in the party that threatens bipartisan support for the war against Russia. The Georgia congresswoman is a notorious provocateur who has made racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic statements and promoted bizarre conspiracy theories. Yet she has emerged as a prominent voice in the House of Representatives after forging a bond with the speaker, Kevin McCarthy, who vowed that Republicans will not write a “blank cheque” for Ukraine. Pentagon accused of blocking effort to hand Russia war crimes evidence to ICC The Pentagon was accused of blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC) about Russian war crimes in Ukraine, Julian Borger reported. The Biden White House and the state department have been a proponent of cooperation with the Hague-based ICC as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes, but the defence department is firmly opposed on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers. Meanwhile, the top US intelligence official said Washington did not believe the Russian military could recover from its losses in Ukraine to make territorial gains there this year, but she warned that Vladimir Putin still believed time was on his side. The assessment, presented by the director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, at a Senate hearing on Wednesday morning, was noncommittal on whether Ukraine could take back significant amounts of occupied land in its planned counter-offensive this spring. War prompts Ukrainians to embrace their language Until last year Kyiv was largely a Russian-speaking city. A survey in January revealed that since Putin’s invasion a year ago, 33% of Kyivans have adopted the Ukrainian language. About 46% said they had been speaking Ukrainian for a long time. Another 13% remain Russian speakers, Luke Harding reported. Ukrainians are bilingual. Ukrainian has traditionally been spoken in the west of the country, with Russian more prevalent in the south and east. The most prominent switcher is Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who grew up in the central Russophone metallurgical city of Kryvyi Rih. As president, Zelenskiy addresses his citizens and foreign parliaments in Ukrainian or English. He speaks Russian only when urging Russian soldiers to surrender, or when pointing out Putin’s actions to Russian citizens, whose understanding of the war shaped by state TV bears little resemblance to reality. Kremlin critic Ilya Yashin speaks out from Russian prison Writing from a cell in a Russian jail known as the Bear, Ilya Yashin remained as defiant as ever, Andrew Roth reported from Moscow. In neat, blue-ink lettering, the opposition politician was able to express himself candidly despite his incarceration. Removing Vladimir Putin from power, he wrote, was a prerequisite to “avoiding the risks of a new world war”. “As long as Putin retains power, war, or at least the threat of war, will be permanent,” Yashin said in written answers to questions from the Guardian, delivered by his lawyers this week. “This man has gone mad from unlimited power and impunity, he has become a slave to his maniacal ambitions.” Yashin was sentenced last year to eight-and-a-half years in prison for a broadcast on his popular YouTube channel in which he accused the Russian army of a massacre of civilians in Bucha."

                    "bodyText": "Britain will help fund a detention centre in northern France as part of a £500m package to stop refugees trying to cross the Channel, Rishi Sunak has said, amid continuing criticism of his plans to lock up and deport those arriving in small boats. After a meeting in Paris, Sunak and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said they had agreed joint funding for more French border patrols, including 500 additional officers and new drones. They said they were aiming to intercept more small boats making dangerous crossings and drastically reduce the number of journeys, which are estimated to reach 60,000 this year. The joint summit came after Sunak this week published legislation that gives ministers a duty to detain and deport people coming to the UK across the Channel on small boats. Sunak has insisted he believes it is legal under international law, but human rights campaigners have condemned it as inhumane and unworkable. The UN refugee agency accused the UK of “extinguishing the right to seek refugee protection” in the UK. Speaking in Paris, Sunak said the legislation he was introducing was legal and “designed to break the business models of the gangs”. The UK and France have previously reached numerous deals involving cooperation between the two countries but the number of people making the journey has increased in recent years. Critics of the plan have said Sunak needs to provide safe and legal routes for refugees fleeing war and persecution to reach the UK before carrying out his plan to detain and deport people. He has said the government will look at creating more routes without specifying how this will happen. Sunak said: “Last year I agreed the largest ever small boats deal with France to increase UK-funded patrols by 40%. This week I announced measures to ensure nobody who enters the UK illegally can remain here. “We don’t need to manage this problem, we need to break it. And today we have gone further than ever before to put an end to this disgusting trade in human life. “Working together, the UK and France will ensure that nobody can exploit our systems with impunity.” Under the plan, the UK will contribute €141m (£125m) this year, €191m next year and €209m in 2025. Last year’s deal increased the number of French law enforcement officers by 40% and the new package will double that number of officers again, and provide some funding for a detention centre in Dunkirk to hold people with no right to remain in France. At the press conference, Sunak spoke warmly of Macron, calling him “mon ami”, and said he hoped relations could improve between the UK and France in the post-Brexit era. He told the French president he felt “very fortunate to be serving alongside” him. Macron has said he wants to have the “best possible relations” with the UK but they need to “fix” the consequences of Brexit. Before the briefing, Macron and Sunak engaged in a last minute one-to-one private meeting for more than an hour, in an apparent attempt to work on their relationship. Their chiefs of staff joined the talks at the last minute, but were not invited for the entire meeting. The pair spoke in English, and exchanged signed shirts ahead of the Six Nations rugby fixture on Saturday. After the discussions, they had lunch together, which included vegetarian sushi, an artichoke dish and a praline tart. Sunak’s approach to Macron was in contrast with his predecessor’s. During Liz Truss’s brief time as prime minister she said the “jury is out” on whether the French president was a “friend or foe”. The pair also signed a new deal on civil nuclear cooperation. Sunak said: “The UK and France are working together so that never again can the likes of [Vladimir] Putin weaponise our energy security. “Today we’re going even further with an ambitious new energy partnership. We’ve signed a new deal on civil nuclear cooperation, agreed that France will examine the case for new energy connectors and committed to work together on low carbon energy.” Before the press conference, Sunak came under renewed pressure over the government’s lack of a concrete plan for detaining tens of thousands of refugees before planning to deport them. His deputy official spokesperson on Friday could not give an estimate of how many places would be needed to house all those crossing the Channel by irregular means and how much those facilities might cost. On Friday night Conservative former minister Tim Loughton said he was “not enthused” by “subsidising the French police force even more”. The East Worthing and Shoreham MP said: “We’ve given them a lot of money, we’ve given them a lot of kit, we’ve given them a lot of joint intelligence. “The thing that is really going to make the difference is when the French police, in their British taxpayer-funded dune buggy, intercepts a group of migrants, they are arrested, and their claims are processed by the French police – not allowed to go and reappear the following night with a new boat, which is what happens at the moment.” Earlier, James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, defended his opposition to a new immigration detention centre in his own constituency, even as he urged his French counterparts to do more to solve the small boats issue. Cleverly said a former RAF base in his Essex constituency of Braintree would not be suitable for 1,500 male asylum seekers, despite the site having been shortlisted by the Home Office as potential accommodation. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday: “We are going to be looking at a range of places and, as you say, I put my thoughts forward. “Ultimately, no decision has been made and I will continue to support the work of my good friends in the Home Office to make sure we get a grip of the situation.”"

Here are the main points from the day: The main announcement from the summit was around strengthened cooperation on the issue of small boats crossing the Channel, which will lead to a new detention centre in northern France, a new command centre with enforcement teams in the same place for the first time, an extra 500 new officers patrolling French beaches, and more drones and surveillance technologies, all of which will be funded by the UK through a nearly half a million pound package. Nevertheless, it will not include an agreement for the UK to be able to return refugees to France, which Macron insisted must be negotiated at an EU level. Charities were quick to criticise the announcement, saying the focus on more detention was disappointing and anti-refugee. The two leaders also agreed upon further security cooperation aimed at bolstering Ukraine’s battlefield presence, including training marines. They also plan to increase the interoperability of the two countries’ forces, combine joint expedititionary forces, promote stability in the Indo-Pacific by coordinating carrier deployments and jointly explore the development of complex weapons, like air defence, combat air and long-range weapons. Partnering on investment in renewable and nuclear energy to improve the two countries’ energy security and reduce cost pressure on citizens was also thrashed out. Macron said that it was important to “fix the consequences of Brexit”, while Sunak affirmed that although the UK had left the EU, it hadn’t left Europe, and that “a close, cooperative, collaborative relationship with our European partners” should start with the UK’s nearest neighbour, France. Speaking to reporters on the Eurostar to Paris in the morning, Sunak defended payments to France as “sensible investments for the UK” and said he was “throwing everything” at resolving the problem of small boats of migrants crossing the Channel. He added that security in Europe was “intertwined” with peace in the Indo-Pacific, and said China should stay out of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. He also said that the war in Ukraine would end at the negotiating table, and vowed to support Volodymyr Zelenskiy to be in the “best possible place to have those talks”. The French press shared its enthusiasm for the meeting with a cover story on the left-leaning Libération newspaper that depicted the two leaders embracing in a chintzy mug. The pairing has swiftly been nicknamed “Le Bromance” in reflection of their similar age and professional background. Sunak tweeted that France and the UK were close neighbours, great friends and historic allies. Thanks again for following today – we’ll see you on Monday. Britain will pay France nearly half a billion pounds over the next three years to step up efforts to prevent small boats from crossing the Channel, Rishi Sunak has announced. PA reports: The prime minister praised the “unprecedented” £478m (€541m) package to fund a new detention centre in France and hundreds of extra law enforcement officers on French shores. Sunak announced the package after holding talks with Emmanuel Macron during a UK-France summit at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Friday. The French president told Sunak the migration returns agreement that he covets under his pledge to “stop the boats” would have to be negotiated with the European Union rather than Paris. The major new package comes on top of the more than £300m UK has committed to France in the last decade to help tackle unauthorised migration. The BBC has tweeted that Gary Lineker will step back from presenting Match of the Day until an agreement is reached on social media use, after an impartiality row over comments he made criticising the government’s new asylum policy. In a tweet, the presenter had compared the language used by the government to set out its plan to “that used by Germany in the 30s”. They might have nailed down important agreements on energy, security and immigration, but commentators have been quick to describe Sunak and Macron’s cordial relationship as “Le Bromance”. The two politicians are a similar age and have a background in banking. The friendship comes after relations turned cold between London and Paris during Boris Johnson and Liz Truss’s premierships, with rows over Brexit, fishing rights and the Aukus submarine deal between the UK, US and Australia. The leaders exchanged rugby shirts before England’s clash with France at Twickenham on Saturday, part of the annual Six Nations tournament. They were signed by the respective playing squads of the teams, No 10 confirmed. Macron and Sunak both made jokes about France v England football and rugby clashes during the press conference, with the prime minister mentioning Les Bleus dumping Gareth Southgate’s footballers out of the World Cup in Qatar. Full Fact, an independent charity of fact checkers and campaigners, has found no evidence to support Rishi Sunak’s claim that there are now 6,000 fewer people in the caseload of the asylum backlog. During prime minister’s questions on 8 March, Rishi Sunak claimed there were 6,000 fewer people in the caseload of the asylum backlog. Moments later, on the same subject, he said: “The backlog is down.” If by the “asylum backlog” Sunak meant the number of people or cases waiting for decisions from the Home Office, then this was incorrect, according to the most recent published figures, Full Fact said. They show a large rise in December, of more than 17,000 people, compared with September 2022. Irish premier Leo Varadkar has said the UK would be required to engage with the European Union to resolve any issues about proposed new EU laws being introduced in Northern Ireland. PA reports: Varadkar made his comments a day after Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris suggested the UK government would be bound to veto any law if the Stormont brake element of the new Windsor Agreement was activated. The framework will reduce the volume of Brexit red tape on the movement of GB goods bound for Northern Ireland that was created by the contentious Northern Ireland Protocol. It also introduces a mechanism – the so-called Stormont brake – that enables a minority of Stormont MLAs to formally flag concerns about the imposition of new EU laws in Northern Ireland in a move that could ultimately lead to the UK government vetoing their introduction. The DUP, which collapsed power-sharing in Northern Ireland in protest at the protocol, has yet to decide whether to back the Windsor Framework and return to devolution. Speaking to reporters in Dublin, Varadkar was asked about Heaton-Harris’s comments. He said: I think what we’re going to have to see is the legislation that the British government introduces, and they’ve committed to consulting with the five main parties in Northern Ireland on that and also the Irish government. We see the Stormont brake as a red flag mechanism, a mechanism by which 30 assembly members from two parties or more can raise an issue, an issue that we will then try to sort out between the EU and UK and that if things can’t be resolved we then go to international binding arbitrations, that’s how we would see it develop, that’s certainly how it’s written down in the legal text that was agreed between the EU and the UK. But of course the UK can bring in its own internal legislation, but they have committed to consulting with the parties on that. The Guardian’s France correspondent, Angelique Chrisafis, has more detail on the new detention centre agreed today: The UK and France’s closer cooperation on migration issues around the Channel means that the UK will for the first time help to fund a detention centre in France. The new centre will be located in the Dunkirk area of northern France. The UK funding will increase the number of places available for the French authorities to hold people who have no right to remain in France as they wait to be deported. Charities are responding critically to the announcements from today’s summit, warning that the focus on more detention is “disappointing” and “anti-refugee”. Christina Marriott, the executive director of strategy and communications at the British Red Cross, said: The focus on more detention in today’s agreement with France is disappointing. It comes after the government’s proposals to stop people from claiming asylum in the UK earlier this week that we remain deeply concerned about. They would be ineffective, hugely expensive, and contrary to the international laws our country was once proud to have shaped. But most of all, this legislation would be devastating for the men, women, and children in need of our help. We want to see a fast, fair but compassionate asylum system. But this week’s measures take us in a completely different direction. The government should focus its efforts on addressing the real problems with the system – like inefficiencies that have resulted in a backlog of 160,000 people waiting for a decision on their claim. Amnesty International UK’s Steve Valdez-Symonds, its refugee and migrant rights director, said: The UK and French governments should make an agreement to share responsibility for providing asylum to people – not more heartless anti-refugee measures that simply seek to absolve the UK from any responsibility at all. Seeking asylum is a vital human right, not something that can be banned or withdrawn for political convenience. The UK receives a relatively small number of the world’s refugees, and it increasingly treats these people atrociously – with ministers vilifying traumatised and marginalised people in the media and condemning them to months or even years of social isolation, deprivation and detention. Fortress Britain policies won’t work and people will continue to drown in the Channel if ministers stubbornly refuse to make safe routes available to people seeking asylum – particularly when they have family or other strong connections here. The government has deliberately destroyed its own asylum system and is now legislating to try to make that destruction permanent. Throwing more money at the French, the Rwandan or any other government cannot fix what the UK government has wrecked. Without a major change of direction from Sunak and Braverman, the terrible consequences of their vandalism of human rights laws and the asylum system is set to get even worse. In his closing remarks, Sunak said the breadth of the discussions today show how closely France and UK plan to work together. We left the EU but we didn’t leave Europe. We want to have a close, cooperative, collaborative relationship with our European partners and allies and of course that starts with our nearest neighbour, France. We’re writing a new chapter in this relationship. Sunak said the biggest driver of inflation and cost-of-living are energy prices. He said one of the “practical, tangible” things to come out of the summit today was around more cooperation on energy security, bringing together researchers, businesses and the two governments. We’re going to be able to get our citizens cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy faster. We want to ease the pressures on the cost of living for them, the way to do that is to diversify and improve our supply of energy and accelerate that transition to net zero and we’ve made good progress on that goal today. Macron said “we have to fix the consequences of Brexit”, many of which were “underestimated”, but which still need to be fixed through new close partnerships. For our businesses and people, we want to build new links. Sunak stressed that work in Calais to dismantle criminal gangs and stop the crossing of small points are “joint efforts” and a “shared challenge”. There’s no one solution to solving this very complicated problem, and it won’t be solved overnight. He defended the UK’s £300m investment in French patrols as “good investments for the UK to make if they stop people coming and reduce pressure on our asylum system”. Sunak added “we want Ukraine to win this war”, and right now that means “providing them with support, capabilities and training to mount a offensive and have decisive advantage on the battlefield”. Asked about comments from the Kremlin that a foreign hand is behind the building protest movement in Georgia, Macron said there was a tendency in Russia to see “any population movement as manipulation from outside”, but that he disagreed. He said images coming out of Georgia were “worrying”, such as those of people carrying the EU flag being “pushed around”, which threatens freedom of speech. “Georgia is subject to very strong pressure,” he said. On Ukraine, he said France’s priority at the moment is to help it conduct a military counter-offensive. Asked about whether the UK and France will ever reach a deal where refugees arriving in the UK can be returned to France, Sunak there had been additional cooperation agreed today, and he expected this would developed further. Conversations need to happen with other European countries, he said, and a new forum has been set up for that to happen. Going forward there will be more that we can do. Macron stressed this is not a UK-France agreement, but a UK-EU agreement, and there will be further discussions at an upcoming summit in Chisinau, Moldova. Macron is a “friend of Britain”, Sunak says, adding: I feel very fortunate to be serving alongside you and incredibly excited about the future we can build together. Merci mon ami. Some cultural partnerships have been agreed as well, including to make it easier for schoolchildren to go on exchanges, and for museum curators, artists and writers to collaborate together. Sunak says the UK and France share a “special bond” and will “always be at the forefront of [our continent’s] defence” as two of the biggest defence powers in the world. The pair have agreed to: Train Ukrainian marines to give Ukraine a decisive advantage on the battlefield and for Ukraine to win this war. Increase interoperability of our forces Harness the full potential of combined joint expedititionery forcez Promote stability in indo-pacific coordinating carrier deployments Jointly explore development of complex weapons, like air defence, combat air and long-range weapons Sunak says UK and France are working together to prevent Putin “weaponising our energy security”. He said they have agreed “an ambitious new energy partnership” including a new deal on civil nuclear cooperation, working together on low carbon energy. Rishi Sunak starts his speech with an acknowledgement the two countries have “faced challenges” but today marks a “new beginning”. Important progress was made on illegal migration, energy and security, he said. He said Macron agrees that “criminal gangs should not get to decide who comes to our countries”. He said the pair have taken cooperation to an “unprecedented level”. This includes: A new detention centre in northern France A new command centre with enforcement teams together in one place for the first time An extra 500 new officers patrolling French beaches More drones and surveillance technologies On illegal immigration, Macron said he wanted to make “progress in lockstep”, and stressed France is aware of the sensitivities involved. He said this year over 30,000 small boat crossings were prevented, and Franco-British intelligence dismantled 55 networks of organised crime. Macron said they had agreed on a renewed bilateral framework: Today we decided to continue in that direction, very concretely and conscious of the shared nature of our responsibility. This includes new initiatives to act together, as well as to collaborate with the Europeans concerned by the transit and crossings and with some countries where trafficking begins. Macron added that the discussions today included cooperation on energy, including cross-investments on renewable energy. There were also discussions about curbing the use of fossil fuels and strengthening biodiversity, he said. Macron confirms he has agreed with Sunak concrete action on training of the Ukrainian military and on high value segments. The Russia-Ukraine war forms an important backdrop to the discussions and increases the need to bolster ties on security and defence, he added. We’ll have to find an outcome to this conflict, we must place our Ukrainian friends in the best possible situation. He adds the UK and France will work on the inter-operability of future systems including mastery of the seabed and energy-directed weapons, building human and technical capacity and an ambition to work together on on future cruise missiles. We wish to build the terms of tomorrow’s European security, to have a genuine legal framework for antimissile protection. The summit marks a “shared will” to work together, Macron says. I believe the will you clearly expressed and we discussed jointly together and what our governments have worked on and what we managed to create goes in that direction, he says. He congratulates Sunak for the Windsor framework and a “new beginning of working more closely with the EU”. Macron cycles through some of the most dramatic events to arise in the past five years; including Brexit and the Covid pandemic. But he says the UK and France are bound by geography and no political decision, global health emergency or anything else could change that. Macron and Sunak are beginning their press conference now, with the French president opening proceedings. The UK prime minister and the French president are due to hold a joint press conference at the Élyseé Palace at around 2pm GMT, following their talks. We’ll bring you the live video here, as well as following both the event and the reaction. The UK would be required to engage with the EU to resolve any issues about proposed new EU laws being introduced in Northern Ireland, the Irish premier, Leo Varadkar, has said. Speaking to reporters in Dublin, Varadkar was asked about the so-called Stormont brake; the mechanism by which a minority of MLAs at Stormont can formally raise concerns with the UK government about new EU rules applying to the region. Varadkar was asked about the UK’s Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris’s admission in Belfast on Thursday that, if the brake were activated, the UK would be “bound” to block the new law in question. Some Stormont parties have expressed concern this indicates the brake will end up handing a powerful veto to a minority of MLAs. I think what we’re going to have to see is the legislation that the British government introduces, and they’ve committed to consulting with the five main parties in Northern Ireland on that and also the Irish government. We see the Stormont brake as a red flag mechanism. A mechanism by which 30 assembly members from two parties or more can raise an issue; an issue that we will then try to sort out between the EU and UK and that if things can’t be resolved we then go to international binding arbitrations. That’s how we would see it develop – that’s certainly how it’s written down in the legal text that was agreed between the EU and the UK. But, of course, the UK can bring in its own internal legislation. But they have committed to consulting with the parties on that. Rishi Sunak and Emmanuel Macron spoke for an hour and took the decision to meet on a one-to-one basis, Downing Street has said. It is understood the prime minister and the French president changed the original plans to ensure they could speak for longer in private. A No 10 spokesperson told reporters in Paris: The prime minister and President Macron spoke for more than an hour one-to-one. They were joined at the end by their respective chiefs of staff for a brief period. It was a warm and productive meeting. They discussed the upcoming Six Nations match, having exchanged signed shirts. They both agreed on the need for further collaboration on a range of issues, including on defence, energy security and illegal migration. The war in Ukraine will end at the negotiating table, Rishi Sunak has said, as he vowed to support Volodymyr Zelenskiy to be in the “best possible place to have those talks”, the Guardian’s political correspondent Aletha Adu writes. While the prime minister indicated that now is not the time for those peace talks, he recommitted to providing additional support to Ukraine to ensure they have an advantage on the battlefield. Sunak’s comments on his way to the first UK-France summit in five years, marked a clear divide in stance on how the war against Russia will end from that of his predecessor Boris Johnson. The former prime minister heaped pressure on Sunak, urging the UK to send jets and tanks to help Ukraine “finish the job”. Speaking on the Eurostar to Paris hours before meeting his “friend” Emmanuel Macron, Sunak said: We’re providing training to use those capabilities. That’s all under way, as well as just helping defend themselves against the attacks that they’re facing, particularly on their critical national infrastructure. Now, that should be everyone’s focus. Of course, this will end as all conflicts do at negotiating table, but that is a decision for Ukraine to make. And what we need to do is put them in the best possible place to have those talks at an appropriate moment that makes sense for them. But at the moment, the priority has got to be giving them the resources the training and the support they need to push forward and create advantage on the battlefield. The prime minister hopes to start a “new chapter” in his relationship with France, and believes the nations’ shared outlook on restoring peace in Ukraine will deepen and strengthen that relationship. The full story is here: Security in Europe is “intertwined” with peace in the Indo-Pacific, the Prime Minister has said, as he warned China to stay out of the Ukraine-Russia conflict. PA reports: During the UK-France summit in Paris, Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron are expected to unveil a plan for increased allied activity in the Indo-Pacific. No 10 said it will include establishing France and the UK as the “backbone” to a permanent European maritime presence there. The approach will include co-ordinating regular deployment of France’s Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier and the UK’s HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales carriers across the region. Sunak, speaking to reporters on board the Eurostar to the summit, said Paris and London were aligned when it came to their approach to the Indo-Pacific, with both declaring they want to be “active participants in the region”. It comes after the UK in 2021 announced a foreign and defence policy “tilt” towards the Indo-Pacific in the government’s integrated review. The Prime Minister said the UK and France were focused on the region “for the same reason”, adding: “The security is intertwined.” He continued: What we’re going to agree today is a really positive step forward, about the joint operations between our armed forces, (about) how we deploy our carrier groups, and how our navies work together. And we want to broaden that out over time. We are two European nations that do genuinely project force and influence and are engaged around the world. So it’s right that we’re collaborating closely and this today, hopefully (what) we will agree later, will be a more significant step forward than we’ve had in the past in that particular region. An update to the integrated review is set to be announced by Sunak on Monday during a visit to the US, with new wording reportedly expected on Britain’s approach to Beijing. Sunak confirmed he and Macron wanted to stress to China and other countries “not to be providing support to Russia” following its invasion of Ukraine. The Prime Minister said he would be discussing the West’s approach to Beijing ahead of the French president’s visit to China, a trip he said was due to happen soon. He added: One thing that we’ve talked about previously in our G7 meetings as well, is a) about our collective economic security, but also ensuring that, as we support Ukraine, part of that is making sure that other countries – we’d urge all countries not to be providing support to Russia, or trying to circumvent sanctions. Downing Street has said that Rishi Sunak and Emmanuel Macron’s joint press conference to discuss the outcome of their talks at the Élysée Palace in Paris will be held around 2pm. Jeremy Hunt is reportedly planning to give middle-class professionals a pensions boost in next week’s budget to encourage them to continue working, the Guardian’s consumer affairs reporter Jess Clark reports. The chancellor will announce significant increases to pensions allowances in a bid to tackle the “pension trap”, which has seen many workers take an early retirement, according to the Daily Mail. The lifetime allowance (LTA) on tax-free pension savings will rise, as well as the £40,000 cap on annual pension contributions, the Daily Mail reported, citing Whitehall sources. The Treasury declined to comment. The reported increase, which could be revealed in the budget on 15 March, is intended to end the pension trap that can leave some professionals – such as doctors – facing higher tax charges if they stay in the workforce. Full story here: Rishi Sunak is “throwing everything” at resolving the problem of small boats of migrants crossing the Channel, and defended payments to France as “sensible investments for the UK”. PA reports: Speaking to reporters on the Eurostar to France this morning, Sunak said the UK government was ready to “pull all the levers at our disposal” to stem the flow of boats. Briefings from France have suggested a multi-year financing deal is on the table which could see Britain agree to pay millions of pounds to Paris in exchange for increased coastline patrols. But the prime minister, who has made stopping the boats one of his top five priorities ahead of the next election, defended the cost of potentially handing more money to Paris to crack down on the problem. He said: If you look at the track record in the last couple of years more recently, not only are we able to intercept thousands of boats just this year, actually, which is positive, the joint work has led to something like a few hundred different arrests, disrupted something like 50 different organised crime gangs. That’s the outcome of all that joint work, so those are sensible investments for the UK. I think everyone knows that we are spending £5.5m a day plus on hotels. We would rather not do that, and the best way to stop that is to stop people coming in the first place. I think it is wrong to characterise it as ‘we are paying someone else to do something else’. This is a shared and joint endeavour to reduce illegal migration more generally, and it’s not just a challenge that the French and ourselves face, it’s a broader European challenge. If we are investing money we want to make sure that that is going on things that we think will make a difference. So you would always expect me to do that, and that’s why we would not invest any money alongside the French in a joint endeavour unless we thought it was going to go on things that will make a difference. Asked why Britain was potentially about to agree to pay more only four months after a £63m deal was sealed, Sunak said: It is not about ‘that didn’t work’. That was just the first step on a journey. And actually, that was great, we got that done so quickly … hopefully we can build on it today and hopefully over time even more to come. The prime minister said there was no “silver bullet” for fixing the Channel issue but added that the illegal migration bill announced this week, French co-operation and a deal on returning Albanian economic migrants were part of an overall clampdown. Sunak was set to discuss with Macron the possibility of an EU-UK returns deal, meaning those arriving from Europe without the right to remain in Britain could be immediately returned to their country of origin. It would also involve the UK taking Britons back who do the same in the EU. The Conservative party leader argued that the Windsor agreement, a pact with the EU designed to fix issues with the Northern Ireland protocol, could pave the way to an accord with Brussels on a returns deal. He said he hoped the framework “opens up other areas of constructive engagement” with the EU and that a returns deal is “one of the things that I want to talk to them about”. During Liz Truss’s brief time as prime minister, she said the “jury is out” on whether Macron was Britain’s friend. Asked on the train whether Macron was a “friend or foe”, Sunak replied: I said at the time I thought France was not just a friend but a close friend of the UK, and I stand by that. I can’t figure out the past, all I can do is look forward, and my view is that having a strong collaborative relationship with the French with President Macron is a good thing for the country. The UK government should reverse “damaging” plans to tackle illegal migration, a senior member of the Scottish Cabinet has warned, adding that SNP ministers are exploring whether the legislation requires Holyrood’s consent, which they would not give. PA reports: Scottish constitution secretary Angus Robertson said SNP ministers were currently “reflecting seriously” on the plans to tackle refugees crossing the English Channel in small boats, to see if Holyrood would be required to give its consent to the legislation. Robertson made it clear that the Scottish government would not back the Illegal Migration Bill. In a letter to UK immigration minister Robert Jenrick, he said: The Scottish government does not support the Bill for a variety of reasons and urges you to reverse your plans and not progress this damaging Bill. He said the draft legislation outlined earlier this week “deepens already significant damage to the UK’s reputation as a place of refuge and our credibility with international partners”. But he also indicated the Bill may impede on devolved areas of policy and may therefore require consent from the Scottish Government. He told Jenrick: “We suspect yet again that some of the measures in this Bill might encroach on already devolved powers and competence – if so, this would be unacceptable.” PA has some background to the discussions today: Rishi Sunak has set preventing the small boats from crossing the strait between England and France as one of his top five priorities ahead of the next election. They are expected to build on a deal announced in November, with the UK agreeing in the autumn to provide £63 million to Paris in a bid to clampdown on trafficking gangs. Under the commitment, the number of French officers patrolling beaches on the country’s northern coastline rose from 200 to 300, while British officers for the first time were also permitted to be stationed in French control rooms and on the approaches to beaches to observe operations. Despite the measures, nearly 3,000 people have arrived via small boats in the UK already this year, with almost 46,000 arriving in 2022. It was reported by the Daily Express that Sunak is ready to give the green light to a deal that would secure a multi-year migration agreement with Paris, which would include Britain paying millions of pounds to France every year to increase the number of patrol officers on French beaches. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly appeared to confirm that any fresh pact would involve more UK investment. Speaking from Paris, he told BBC Breakfast: It will cost money, it has cost money and of course we will be negotiating how we fund that joint work to prevent those migration attempts across the Channel. I’m not going to speculate as to the outcomes of the negotiation but we have been spending money doing this, it’s right and proper that we do and of course we will be spending money in the future. No 10 has remained tight-lipped on the prospect of a deal being given the green light at the summit but has said the Prime Minister will be calling on his counterpart to “go further” on measures to stop the boats. The talks between the leaders comes days after Sunak and Home Secretary Suella Braverman, who is also meeting with her counterpart in the French capital on Friday, unveiled the Illegal Migration Bill. The legislation announced on Tuesday would see migrants who arrive through unauthorised means deported and hit with a lifetime ban from returning. It is thought Macron is likely to want to hear from the Prime Minister about how the bill will make Britain a less attractive destination for migrants. As Sunak and Macron are talking, including about a multi-year funding settlement to help pay for policing efforts in northern France, Sky News’ Sam Coates has tweeted documents showing that the UK has spent over £300m in payments to France aimed at stopping small boat crossings since 2014. France and the UK are “close neighbours”, “great friends” and “historic allies”, prime minister Rishi Sunak has tweeted. Posting a photo of a warm handshake with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, he added: “It’s great to be in Paris.” The Guardian’s France correspondent Angelique Chrisafis is in Paris today, reporting from the summit: Rishi Sunak arrived at the Elysée Palace in a Range Rover with a British flag flying. Emmanuel Macron greeted him warmly with several rounds of handshakes and back-patting before they went into their first lengthy working meeting. The two leaders – both former investment bankers, sons of doctors, and of similar age – have billed this first meeting as a chance to deepen their working relationship and personally “reset” and repair the troubled cross-Channel relationship. Franco-British relations had in recent years plummeted to their worst state in decades, dominated by bitter rows over submarine contracts, post-Brexit fishing rights and who was to blame for the catastrophic deaths of people trying to reach the UK coast on small boats. Sunak’s main message, as stressed in an interview with the French daily Le Figaro this morning, was that Macron is a “great friend” and France is an ally and close partner. Sunak said he wanted to write “a new chapter in the relationship”, that he personally had very warm feelings for France, having worked with French bosses in the banking sector. France was his favourite holiday destination, he said. High on the agenda for this morning’s discussions is joint support for Ukraine and further defence cooperation between the UK and France, with an announcement expected this afternoon on closer British and French support for Ukraine. The issue of migration and small boats crossing the Channel is a high priority for the UK. But the talks in Paris will focus on one specific area: reinforcing the existing close cooperation between France and the UK in securing and policing the northern French coast to prevent small boats from crossing. Friday’s summit will not discuss any issue of returning migrants to France. This is an EU matter and must be handled at EU level by Sunak, in UK-EU talks, not on a bilateral basis with France. Rishi Sunak has now arrived at the Élysée Palace in Paris, where he is meeting with Emmanuel Macron today. As Emmanuel Macron prepares to welcomes Rishi Sunak to Paris’s Franco-British summit on Friday, the Élysée sees it as a “turning of the page” – the end of a nightmare chapter in cross-Channel relations, writes the Guardian’s France correspondent, Angelique Chrisafis. The mood between France and the UK had in recent years plummeted to its worst state in decades with bitter rows over submarine contracts, fishing rights and who was to blame for the catastrophic deaths of people trying to reach the UK coast on small boats. The fact that a Franco-British summit is taking place at all is seen as a kind of victory in Paris. “Our priority is to reconnect and get back into the habit of working together,” an Elysée official said. The full analysis is here: A hug between Rishi Sunak and Emmanuel Macron is on the front cover of France’s left-leaning Libération daily newspaper this morning. The headline reads: “Nice to see you again.” The embracing pair are pictured on a chintzy mug, encircled by a heart. The strap line reads: After several years of turbulence linked to Brexit, Paris and London are attempting to renew relations this Friday with a bilateral summit, the first in five years. In the article previewing the meeting, Libération takes the meeting as a sign of a “serious relaunch” of “renewed and constructive” relations after “seven years in which they steadily grew colder”. The newspaper views King Charles’s first official overseas visit as “the icing on the cake”. Refugees have said detaining asylum seekers will “traumatise” and not deter them, describing the government’s illegal migration bill as “cruel and abhorrent”. The statement shared by the Refugee Council comes before a summit between Rishi Sunak and Emmanuel Macron, which will discuss the UK’s controversial proposals to curb Channel crossings by removing asylum seekers from the UK and banning them for life. Farzad, who did not wish to share his second name, arrived in the UK by boat in 2019 after fleeing Iran due to persecution he faced for religious reasons and said he did not think the bill would act as a deterrent. He said: [Detaining asylum seekers] will traumatise them more and make them more vulnerable. When people are running, they are more concerned with what they are running from, not what they are running to. They don’t sit down and calculate … they are mostly worried about their life in their home country, and that’s why they are basically leaving their lives and coming here. I decided to go to the UK, because I speak English … they put me in a lorry, and then in a van. After this long journey, they forced me and a few other people into a boat – this was not what they had promised me to do, I was not supposed to come by boat … it was dark, it was foggy, it was cold. I claimed asylum on the spot (and) after a year I was granted asylum. Had I been treated differently, I’m not sure life would turn out the way it is now for me. Good morning. Fridays are often quiet in Westminster but today a major event is taking place: the first UK-France summit in five years. Rishi Sunak is set to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to discuss Channel small boat crossings. Sunak will be looking to strengthen policing of the Channel coast and reach a deal on returning people who arrive from France, although officials expect Macron will defer this to a wider EU-wide returns deal. Macron in turn wants the UK to agree to a multi-year funding settlement to help pay for policing efforts in northern France to prevent crossings. The Times reported that the UK could offer up to £200m over three years to stop crossings “at source”. Small boats are a priority for Sunak, who has invested considerable political capital in the controversial new immigration bill that will criminalise anyone who arrives unofficially, with the threat of rapid deportation and a permanent ban from settling in the UK. Wider bilateral issues such as defence and Ukraine are also on the agenda, with concrete announcements including an agreement to develop precision strike weapons to combat Russian aggression expected. Here’s the agenda for the day: 10am: Bilateral talks between Sunak and Macron at the Élysée Palace. 11am: Sunak and Macron to meet UK and French business leaders. 2pm: Joint press conference with live video planned. A joint statement is also expected at the end of the day. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, and the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, will all meet their French counterparts. There will also be a focus on rebuilding more cordial relations following tensions over Brexit and the more abrasive approaches of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. The Guardian’s diplomatic correspondent, Patrick Wintour, writes that the summit is “not just important bilaterally, but also in terms of Britain’s relationship with the EU”. We’ll be keeping you updated with the latest from the summit, where our political correspondent Aletha Adu and France correspondent Angelique Chrisafis are reporting. Separately, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is visiting Scotland today, where he is expected to “pledge to put Scottish innovation at the ‘heart’ of plans to boost the economy”. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, is calling for a cut to energy bills and a plan to insulate homes, before the party’s Scottish conference. Thanks for following us today, as always you can drop me a line with anything we’ve missed."

                    "bodyText": "Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner mercenary group, said on Friday he had thanked the Russian government for a “heroic” increase in production of ammunition, but he was still worried about shortages for his fighters and the Russian army as a whole. Prigozhin also said Wagner had opened recruitment centres in 42 Russian cities. “In spite of the colossal resistance of the Ukrainian armed forces, we will go forward. Despite the sticks in the wheels that are thrown at us at every step, we will overcome this together,” he said. Most of Kyiv’s power supply has been restored, officials said, as Ukraine again responded swiftly and defiantly to the latest Russian missile and drone barrage targeting critical infrastructure, Associated Press reports. US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War had said in its daily update that Wagner appears to be taking a “tactical pause” in Bakhmut. The ISW believes that Wagner is waiting for until enough reinforcements of conventional Russian troops have arrived before taking a backseat in the fierce battle. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has said the energy situation is difficult following Russia’s barrage of attacks on Thursday. In a message on Telegram, he said “the energy system has suffered significant damage. Nevertheless, critical infrastructure has already been restored in the city, and water supply has been almost completely restored”. However, public transport remains closed. Switzerland’s government said on Friday it will not change its longstanding policy banning the transfer of Swiss-made arms to a third country despite growing pressure from countries to export them to Ukraine. “The federal council is committed to the values of Swiss neutrality and will continue to work to ensure the benefits of neutrality are realised,” it said in a statement. The UN nuclear watchdog’s 35-nation board of governors on Friday backed the reappointment of Argentina’s Rafael Grossi to a second four-year term as director general, diplomats at the closed-door meeting said. Finland’s prime minister Sanna Marin visited Kyiv on Friday and met President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Thousands of people, including Marin and Zelenskiy, gathered in Kyiv to attend the funeral of the well-known Ukrainian military commander Dmytro Kotsiubailo, nicknamed ‘’Da Vinci’’ and hailed as a national hero and symbol of resistance. Kotsiubailo, who in 2021 was awarded the top military honour of the Order of the Golden Star by Zelenskiy, giving him the title “Hero of Ukraine”, who was killed near Bakhmut on Tuesday at the age of 27. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the war in Ukraine will end at the negotiating table. Sunak said he would support president Zelenskiy to be in the “best possible place to have those talks”. Ukraine handed suspicion notices on Friday to three former senior managers of the aircraft manufacturer Antonov for obstructing the country’s military and allowing Russia to destroy the giant Mriya cargo plane at the start of the war. Russian president, Vladimir Putin, congratulated Xi Jinping on Friday after the Chinese leader secured an unprecedented third term as president. In a telegram, Putin said he was sure the two leaders could advance their cooperation on the most important regional and international issues The Kremlin said on Friday it sees risks of possible “provocations” in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two Russian-backed breakaway regions of Georgia, after days of protests in Georgia over a “foreign agents” bill. Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that Moscow was watching the situation “with concern”. The war in Ukraine is driven by the interests of several “empires” and not just the “Russian empire”, Pope Francis said in an interview published on Friday. In the early hours of Thursday, Russia unleashed its largest missile bombardment against Ukraine in three weeks, including six hypersonic missiles able to evade air defences. The UK ministry of defence said Friday the death toll from yesterday’s mass strikes stands at 11. Critical infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions were hit and Zelenskiy said. “The occupiers … won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done.” At least six of the dead were killed in a strike on a residential area in the western Lviv region, 700km (440 miles) from the frontline, Ukrainian emergency services said. Three buildings were destroyed by fire after the missile attack and rescue workers were combing through rubble looking for more possible victims. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total on Thursday, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Russia’s defence ministry said it had carried out a “massive retaliatory strike” as payback for a cross-border raid last week. It claimed to have hit all its intended targets, destroying drone bases, disrupting railways and damaging facilities that make and repair arms. Ukrainian authorities insist they will continue to try to hold the eastern city of Bakhmut, despite suffering an estimated 100-200 casualties a day. Ukraine’s national security chief, Oleksiy Danilov, has said that one Ukrainian is killed for every seven Russians, and claimed that Ukrainian soldiers are killing as many as 1,100 Russians a day. Western officials have estimated Russian casualties in Bakhmut at 20,000-30,000. Belarus’s authoritarian leader has signed a bill introducing capital punishment for state officials and military personnel convicted of high treason. The amendments to the country’s criminal code endorsed by leader Alexander Lukashenko envisage death sentences for officials and service personnel who cause “irreparable damage” to Belarus’s national security through acts of treason. Russia has introduced personal sanctions against 144 government officials, journalists, lawmakers and other public figures from the three Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – deemed “most hostile” to Moscow. Over in Cyprus the newly installed president, Nikos Christodoulides, has gone out of his way to denounce Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, barely 10 days after he assumed power. In his first interview with a foreign TV channel, Christodoulides told Greece’s state broadcaster, ERT, that opposing Moscow’s self-styled “special military operation” put the island on the “right side of history”."

                    "headline": "Iran and Saudi Arabia agree to restore ties after China-brokered talks",
                    "bodyText": "Iran and Saudi Arabia, the two great oil-producing rivals of the Middle East, have agreed to restore ties and reopen embassies seven years after relations were severed. The agreement came after Chinese-brokered talks held in Beijing. “As a result of the talks, Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed to resume diplomatic relations and reopen embassies … within two months,” Iran’s state news agency Irna reported, citing a joint statement. Riyadh cut ties with Tehran after Iranian protesters attacked Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran in 2016 following the Saudi execution of the revered Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr. The rivalry between predominantly Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia has dominated Middle East politics in recent years, spreading into Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. Nour News, which is linked to Iran’s supreme national security council, posted footage of Ali Shamkhani, the council’s secretary, with a Saudi official and China’s most senior diplomat, Wang Yi. “After implementing the decision, the foreign ministers of both nations will meet to prepare for exchange of ambassadors,” Iranian state television said. The agreement has potentially wide implications for the Iran nuclear deal and the civil war in Yemen, where the two sides are locked in a proxy war, and shows the new determination of Saudi Arabia to conduct a foreign policy independent of the west. The Saudi Press Agency confirmed the agreement, which said the two countries had agreed to respect state sovereignty and not interfere in each other’s internal affairs. The statement also said Riyadh and Tehran had agreed to activate a security cooperation agreement signed in 2001. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran’s foreign minister, said: “The return of normal relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia provides great capacities to the two countries, the region and the Islamic world. The neighbourhood policy, as the key axis of the government’s foreign policy, is strongly moving in the right direction, and the diplomatic apparatus is actively behind the preparation of more regional steps.” Talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran on a potential reconciliation have been continuing for years mainly in Iraq, so it comes as a surprise that the deal was sealed in China. Shamkhani, Iran’s national security secretary, acknowledged the role played by Baghdad, saying he appreciated Iraqi efforts in hosting five rounds of Iran-Saudi Arabia talks and adding that their efforts were valuable in paving the way for the agreement. Saudi sources said it was important that it was China’s plan that will, at least in principle, hold Iran to account. The deal could, however, have implications for a US-led effort to isolate Iran economically through sanctions. If there is a genuine warming of Saudi relations with Tehran, one consequence is likely to be Saudi investment inside Iran. A further potential consequence of the diplomatic re-engagement is that Saudi Arabia may rein back its London-based satellite channel Iran International, which has proved popular inside Iran by siding with the protesters. Speaking in London earlier this week, the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud, defended Saudi Arabia’s links with China, saying: “China is our largest trading partner. It is also the largest trading partner of most countries. And that is a reality that we will have to deal with. China, for us, is an important and valued partner in many areas. We have excellent working relationships across many sectors. But we have said and repeat this, always, we will look towards our own interests. And we will look for them in the west and in the east.” He also stressed that he believed the Iran nuclear talks in their current form were moribund, and it would be better to change the format so that other currently excluded regional powers most affected by Iran’s nuclear programme were included. Prince Saud added that he did not think the Saudis would have any additional demands about Iran’s civil nuclear programme than those currently posed by the west, but said: “I believe we can, when we are at the table, make it quite clear to the Iranians that this is not just a concern of distant countries, but it’s also a concern of its neighbours. Those neighbours would move into seeking better normal relations. So if we make clear that this is part of reassuring us, I think that may help them find it more acceptable to engage in such a process.” In Yemen, the Saudis have been backing the internationally recognised government in an eight-year civil war against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels based in the north, but have been looking for a way to end the war by conducting private talks in Oman with the Houthis. Saudi Arabia will hope that Iran will halt Houthi drone and missile strikes on the kingdom, and that Iran will help with Saudi talks with the Houthis. But officials stressed that expectations would, at least initially, remain low. The pact does not necessarily mean any change in the Saudi approach to the Palestinian conflict, where it has been warning Israel that it is on course to cause dangerous bloodshed. However, the deal will cause concern among many Israeli politicians who have sought global isolation for its arch-enemy Iran. Naftali Bennett, the former Israeli prime minister, described the pact as a “serious and dangerous” development and a “fatal blow to the effort to create a regional alliance” against the Islamic Republic. Saudi Arabia has refused to join the Abraham accords that normalised relations between Israel and some Arab states."

                    "bodyText": "There was a moment in federal parliament this week when the seriousness of the looming Aukus announcement seemed to dawn on the defence minister, Richard Marles. “It is difficult to overstate the step that, as a nation, we are about to take,” Marles, in the acting prime minister’s chair, solemnly told the chamber on Thursday. “Australia will become just the seventh country to have the ability to operate a nuclear-powered submarine. We have never operated a military capability at this level before.” The statement may not have been intended to raise doubts about whether Australia is up to the task – but it does happen to underline the extremely complex undertaking the country is about to pursue. These challenges include building up a predicted workforce of 10,000 or more to develop Australia’s nuclear expertise and safely build, operate, maintain and regulate the new submarines. After 18 months of planning among Australia, the US and the UK, the three countries’ leaders are set to finally announce the details of the so-called “optimal pathway” for Australia to have “at least” eight nuclear-powered submarines. This is expected in San Diego on Monday local time, Tuesday morning Canberra time. But we have had some clues about the outlines of the deal, thanks to leaks out of the US and the UK. It seems Australia could acquire up to five Virginia class submarines from the US by the mid 2030s before adopting a British design as a more permanent solution. For now, many questions remain unanswered. It’s unclear how much it will cost, how we’ll pay for it, when construction in South Australia will begin and what plans we have in the meantime to invite US and UK submarines to visit Australia for extended periods. But it is worth noting that the Australian government – while not confirming any of the details in advance – felt it was necessary to pre-emptively reassure partners in south-east Asia and the Pacific of the motivations for proceeding with the submarine acquisition. Indonesia and Malaysia were likely front of mind when Marles said that even though the submarines would have the capability to operate at war, “the true intent” was to defend the rules-based order across the region. “So I want to say at this moment to our neighbours and to our friends around the world that as Australia invests in its defence, as we acquire this nuclear-powered submarine capability, we do so as part of making our contribution to the peace and the stability of our region and of the world,” Marles told parliament on Thursday. In any case, the dribs and drabs of details were enough to spark a fresh round of criticism from Beijing. Reinforcing its longstanding position, the Chinese foreign ministry said later on Thursday: “We urge the US, the UK and Australia to abandon the cold war mentality and zero-sum games, honour international obligations in good faith and do more things that are conducive to regional peace and stability.” For all of the Albanese Labor government’s attempts to “stabilise” the relationship with China, the overarching defence and national security settings remain largely bipartisan. Labor has dialled down the volume of the government’s public commentary and has put serious effort into re-engaging diplomatically with Australia’s largest trading partner – and this has borne some fruit. But Labor is on common ground with the Coalition in worrying about the scale and intentions of China’s own military buildup. It has reaffirmed concerns about the militarisation of disputed features in the South China Sea. Australia also continues to oppose any unilateral change to the status quo around Taiwan, a self-governed democracy of 24 million people that China sees as a wayward province and has not ruled out taking it by force. Comments by China’s new foreign minister, Qin Gang, this week would only have added to those concerns in Canberra. Qin poured scorn on Joe Biden’s push to agree on “guardrails” to ensure competition between the great powers did not spiral into war. (The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has repeatedly encouraged Beijing to take up this US offer, saying all countries must play their part to “avert catastrophic conflict”.) At a press event, Qin read from a copy of the constitution of the People’s Republic of China to declare that Taiwan was “part of the sacred territory of the People’s Republic of China” and that it was “the inviolable duty of all Chinese people, including our compatriots in Taiwan, to accomplish the great task of reunifying the motherland”. Describing Taiwan as “the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations”, Qin warned the US against taking “a reckless gamble with the stakes being the fundamental interests of the two peoples and even the future of humanity”. “If the United States does not hit the brake but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation. Who will bear the catastrophic consequences?” Kevin Rudd, Australia’s soon-to-be-ambassador to the US, will be active in pushing the guardrails concept when he arrives in Washington DC. He was clear this week that Australian strategic thinking was driven by a key question: “How do we deter our friends in China from taking premeditated military action against Taiwan, which will then be a fundamental destabilisation of the strategic status quo?” The Australian government has argued there is no contradiction between its desire to acquire the best defence assets possible (as part of maintaining a “strategic equilibrium” in the Indo-Pacific) and its continued push for a less rocky relationship with China. But it’s quite the needle to thread. And for all the focus on the precise detail to come, Aukus will clearly be seen overall as Australia drawing even closer to the US and the UK for decades."

The NRL CEO, Andrew Abdo, hailed players’ response to alleged incident of racial abuse, while NSW premier Dominic Perrottet called for ‘life bans’ for racism at sporting games. China’s foreign ministry has spoken out against the AUKUS deal, saying it “exacerbates [the] arms race” and “hurts peace and stability” in the region. As part of his India trip, prime minister Anthony Albanese declared the country a ‘top tier security partner’, vowing to deepen military ties. A Senate committee is recommending that parliament consider the case for a four-day working week.

Australia’s largest online bookseller, Booktopia, will fork out $6m in penalties after it made false or misleading claims about consumer guarantee rights. A Queensland mother whose son took his life after interactions with Centrelink has called for change at the robodebt royal commission. Former PM Kevin Rudd has said US-China tensions are a worry, adding that recent brash rhetoric from the Chinese government could be partly attributed to China’s own domestic challenges. Climate change threatening global coffee supplies Australia’s love affair with coffee has the potential to hit flat white and latte sippers in the hip pocket as climate change threatens global supplies of the humble bean, AAP reports. Extreme weather has steadily increased across the top 12 coffee-producing regions globally over the past 40 years, putting vulnerable crops at risk. New research from the CSIRO and University of Southern Queensland suggests concurrent climate hazards could impact international supplies. Study lead Doug Richardson said extreme weather conditions could result in a mass shortage. We’re pretty confident climate change is playing a role in this because the main problem used to be conditions were too cool and now they’re often too warm and that aligns with what we know about the impacts of climate change. Coffee crops can fail if the annual average temperature and rainfall is not within an optimal range. About three in four Australians enjoy at least one cup of coffee per day, according to data from research company McCrindle. Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows the nation is one of the world’s biggest coffee importers, spending nearly $700 million on coffee products in 2020. Aussies have also been credited with inventing the famous flat white in the mid 1980s. The multi-billion dollar coffee industry is mostly supplied by Central and South America, Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

A fleet of nine helicopters, including local cattle-mustering aircraft, was used to airlift scores of vulnerable people from the town of 168 near the Gulf of Carpentaria on Friday. The rain has eased but planes are unable to get to Burketown with the local airstrip inundated by the Albert River, which is steadily rising after surpassing the record 6.78m level recorded in 2011. Burketown Shire mayor, Ernie Camp, said further evacuations could be triggered and he urged residents to be prepared. “All residents, regardless of whether you identify as vulnerable or not, are encouraged to make sure you have a small bag/backpack prepared for possible evacuation at short notice, including any medication and important documents,” he said in an alert to residents on Friday. “If you are concerned about leaving your pets behind, please contact council. A reminder that pets are not allowed to be evacuated.” It was hard to predict whether homes and businesses were going to go under because flood modelling was so limited, Mount Isa police superintendent Tom Armitt said. About 25 elderly people were airlifted about 230km east to Normanton and 18 children, each accompanied by a parent, were flown to Mount Isa, about 440km to the south. About 100km southwest in the Indigenous community of Doomadgee, 10 elderly people have also been moved from an aged care home to a hospital as a precaution. The Nicholson River is at record flood levels and stormwater is backing up, although there is no spillover in the town, a QFES spokeswoman said. Hastie pledges support for submarine deal Opposition Defence spokesman Andrew Hastie has conceded that it “makes sense” for the government to purchase Virginia-class submarines. Hastie was on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, and reiterated the bi-partisan support for Aukus: I think, given the urgency of the strategic situation, an off-the-shelf purchase of the Virginia class submarines … does make sense because first of all we have to respond to the strategic environment, that is critical, absolutely critical. But I think, by the sounds of it, and again we will wait and see, these things will happen concurrently so I think the prime minister in previous statements has said there might be up to 10 submarines being built in Adelaide so I think it is win-win. We’re certainly going to hold the government to account on things like timing and budgets and the plan to deliver AUKUS, but we need to work together because this is nation-building. Charities regulator to investigate Hillsong The charities regulator has announced it is investigating concerns raised about Hillsong, after independent MP Andrew Wilkie yesterday tabled thousands of pages of financial records which he alleged showed the church had engaged in money laundering and tax evasion. Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) commissioner Sue Woodward said it was “extremely rare” for the body to comment on investigations, but issued a statement today to “correct the record”. Wilkie had alleged the ACNC, plus other bodies including the tax office and the securities and investment commission, had been provided with the documents, but not acted - but Woodward said this was not the case. “Although it was stated in parliament that the ACNC has not acted, I can confirm that we are investigating concerns raised about Hillsong Church charities. Hillsong has stated publicly that it is fully cooperating with regulatory authorities,” she said in a statement today. Hillsong has disputed the allegations, claiming many of Wilkie’s representations were false or out of context, and that it was engaging with regulators as part of an ongoing legal case. “Hillsong Church has been open and transparent with our congregation about past governance failures, and over the past twelve months we have engaged independent, professional assistance to overhaul our governance and accountability procedures,” it said in a statement. In a statement to Guardian Australia, Hillsong said it was “a different church now than we were twelve months ago” and pushed back on many of Wilkie’s claims. “The claims made in federal parliament by Mr Andrew Wilkie are out of context and relate to untested allegations made by an employee in an ongoing legal case,” the statement, distributed by a public relations company, read. Woodward also said the ACNC hadn’t received a whistleblower disclosure on the documents. “If a whistleblower of a charity wants protection, or is concerned about possible harm as a result of making a disclosure, they must raise concerns with an agency deemed to be an eligible recipient. The ACNC is not an eligible recipient and we are not able to provide protection,” she said. “Anyone can raise a concern about a charity with the ACNC. No matter where a concern originates, we use a standard independent process to review its details and, if necessary, we conduct an investigation. Any investigation we undertake must be thorough, comprehensive and consistent with our approach to all investigations. They can be complex and take time to complete.” Sydney rail workers’ pay increase leaves government policy ‘in tatters’, Unions NSW says AAP is reporting that rail workers in Sydney will receive an extra one per cent yearly increase in their pay after the Fair Work Commission handed down its decision in a long-running wages dispute. The commission’s ruling means workers will receive an additional one per cent pay increase on top of the existing offer made by the state government when negotiations for a new enterprise agreement began in May 2021. The disagreements over the rate of pay increases led to prolonged industrial action affecting NSW trains, culminating in a network-wide shutdown in February last year. The rail unions lodged the first of several applications with the commission in September after failing to reach agreement with the government. The commission ruled that the initial one per cent wage increase will be applied from May 2022, with another one per cent increase applied from May 2023. Unions NSW secretary, Mark Morey, said the decision has blown a hole in the government’s wages policy. “This is a momentous decision that delivers significantly higher pay than the NSW government intended. The credibility of its pay policy is in tatters.” Unions NSW said Sydney train employees will now receive a pay rise of 3.53% from 2022, with back pay to be paid out, and an increase of 4.03% from 2023. They will also get a one-off payment of $4500. Mr Morey said the rise in the cost of living is seeing people struggle with things like surging rents and sky-high mortgage repayments, and the extra one per cent a year will make a significant difference. “For many it will be the difference between paying for school excursions or a modest summer holiday.” The following post contains references to suicide A Queensland mother whose son took his life after interactions with Centrelink has called for change at the robodebt royal commission. Echoing the testimony of another witness, Jennifer Miller, Kathleen Madgwick told the inquiry she was stonewalled by the Department of Human Services as she sought answers about her son Jarrad’s death in May 2019. She said letters to the then government services minister, Stuart Robert, and Scott Morrison, also went unanswered. Madgwick said on Friday she wanted changes to the system after Jarrad, 22, took his life following interactions with Centrelink over a welfare debt and a rejected Newstart Allowance claim. Madgwick said Jarrad had been staying with her in May 2019 after a period battling homelessness and mental health issues. She said on 30 May 2019, Jarrad was informed his Newstart application had been denied because he had not provided his bank details, which he disputed. An initial phone call was terminated by Centrelink after Jarrad become angry, but they were later able to confirm his details to the agency. Madgwick said Jarrad came out of his room later that night and said he’d been informed he wouldn’t be paid Newstart because he had a welfare debt of around $2,000. The inquiry heard the debt was calculated using payslips, rather than the unlawful income averaging method. The pair later argued, and Jarrad left the home about 6.45pm, Madgwick told the inquiry. Magdwick said she thought Jarrad had gone to cool off and she later received a message saying, “I love you.” Her son was later found dead. Madgwick told the commission people who were already not receiving an income should not receive a debt from Centrelink, and the agency needed to improve its processes to ensure people with vulnerabilities were identified. The inquiry continues.

Picken is suing the AFL and the Western Bulldogs over allegations he was left in the dark about cognitive impairments he suffered as a result of concussions and was still sent out to play. In a statement the AFL said: The AFL has not been contacted by a law firm and has not received formal notification regarding any action on this matter. The health and safety of players at all levels of the game is the AFL’s key priority and we take concussion and the protection of the brain health of all those playing our game extremely seriously. The 2016 premiership player retired from football after receiving a head injury in a 2018 pre-season match. AAP is reporting that Australia’s largest online bookseller will fork out $6m in penalties after it made false or misleading claims about consumer guarantee rights. Booktopia admitted from at least January 10, 2020 until November 2, 2021, it misled customers through its online terms of business. The terms claimed customers were only entitled to a refund, repair or replacement if they alerted the retailer to a faulty or wrong order within two business days of receiving a product. Booktopia also admitted the terms misled customers by stating they were not entitled to a refund for digital products – including eBooks – for any reason, including if those products were faulty. Additionally, it misled 19 customers by telling them about the two business days rule, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said. “Consumers are entitled to return faulty products within a reasonable time and receive a refund, repair or replacement depending on the nature of the fault,” the regulator’s commissioner Liza Carver said. “We do not know how many consumers may have been deterred from seeking a refund or replacement by Booktopia’s misleading representations on its website.” The federal court on Friday ordered Booktopia to pay $6m in penalties for the false or misleading representations and also demanded it publish a notice on its website within 21 days to correct the claims. Booktopia also has to establish a consumer law compliance program. In an ASX announcement, it acknowledged the statements it made were incorrect and inconsistent with its obligations under Australian consumer law. “Booktopia takes its obligations under the Australian consumer law and its commitment to customer service very seriously and has cooperated with the (Competition and Consumer Commission) throughout the process,” chairman Peter George said. “We are glad to put this behind us and to continue to serve Australian customers with the book buying experience they have known and loved for many years.” The Competition and Consumer Commission launched court proceedings against Booktopia in December 2021. Union backs Senate recommendation on national reconstruction fund bill Steve Murphy, the national secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU), has commented on the Senate report recommending the national reconstruction fund be passed. Murphy said: The AMWU welcomes the Senate’s recommendation that the national reconstruction fund (NRF) pass parliament. It’s a welcome first step on the road toward rebuilding our manufacturing industries. The NRF isn’t just an opportunity to rebuild domestic manufacturing. It’s an opportunity to rebuild workers’ power after decades of attacks by conservative governments and their big-business donors. If the NRF just throws public money at the biggest manufacturing companies, most of it will end up in the pockets of executives and shareholders. Giving workers representation on the NRF’s board would prevent it from becoming a slush fund for the top end of town. The NRF should also require that businesses receiving public funding have collective bargaining agreements. Otherwise, it risks rewarding businesses that exploit their workers, undercut the rest of the manufacturing industry, and cut corners on health and safety. Businesses receiving public money should be held to a higher standard than the profit motive. Foreign minister Penny Wong has issued her condolences to the victims of the shooting in Germany: Coalition vows to reinstate live sheep exports Opposition leader Peter Dutton has vowed he would reinstate live sheep exports if he were to win government, criticising Labor for phasing out the practice. He told a press conference (held at a farm, in case anyone was wondering who the message was directed at) and railed against those he thinks Labor is trying to please (inner-city Melbourne and inner-city Canberra). I wanted to make it very clear today that we’ll support the industry, firstly to fight against Labor’s attempts to close it down, and if they do close it down, our commitment to reinstate it. It’s hard to find an alternative for these farms, their families … Some people are very shell-shocked. They have worked hard for generations to build up an asset. I think the Labor party has made its mind up and they’re going through this pantomime. They have a particular audience they want to please in inner-city Melbourne and inner-city Canberra. They have no regard for farming families out here in the west. Bulldogs premiership player Liam Picken has launched action in the supreme court against his former club and the AFL, claiming he was left in the dark about cognitive impairments he suffered as a result of concussions and was still sent out to play. In a writ lodged with the court on Wednesday, the 2016 premiership player claims he repeatedly flagged concerns he was suffering symptoms after being concussed, but was never sent to an expert for help and was allowed to continue playing. Michael Tanner, Principal of National Compensation Lawyers, who is representing Picken, now 36, alleges the player is still suffering symptoms today, including an aversion to bright lights. In a statement, Tanner said the club and the AFL had a responsibility to the player’s health. His lawyers claim Picken suffered various concussive events throughout his playing career with the Western Bulldogs that were either known, or should have been known to the AFL, and the club His lawyers allege Picken underwent a number of cognitive assessments which showed irregular results and despite such was returned to the field to play and that he was not provided with further specialist medical care and assessment following the irregular test results. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Western Bulldogs said the club was not able to comment: To this point, the Western Bulldogs have not received any formal notification about this matter, nor have we had any approach from his legal representative(s). Accordingly, we are not able to comment. Concussion remains a significant issue within our industry, with several actual concussion-related claims in existence against other clubs / AFL and other claims being mooted as imminent. As a club, the health, safety and wellbeing of all of our players (and all of our people) remains paramount at all times. This remains non-negotiable. The Western Bulldogs will provide further updates as and when required. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe copped flak earlier this year for his notable absence from the public, particularly after the February interest rate which seemed to signal a more hawkish view towards the inflation risks. Lowe didn’t help things by meeting privately with bankers at a meeting arranged by Barrenjoey, an investment bank, before fronting the public. He did appear before two committees with MPs the following week in Canberra, but more than a few journalists bemoaned the absence of Lowe’s regular appearance before the National Press Club. Journalists got a bit of a look-in at a conference held by the Australian Financial Review, a day after Lowe and fellow RBA board members hiked the cash rate for a record 10th consecutive meeting. (As an aside, the Australian newspaper for some reason always calls the AFR, the “Financial Review”, claiming sole naming rights for “Australian”, it seems.) Anyway, Lowe is at last going to make himself available for the National Press Club on 5 April in Sydney, a day after the next RBA board meeting. As of yesterday, investors were betting there was almost a two-in-three chance that the RBA would pause in its hikes, a view aided in part by his use of “pause” in his AFR summit speech. From this perch, we reckon that 5 April speech will be about why Lowe thinks 11 rate rises (to 3.85% by next month) will suffice for now, as we speculated here: Lowe, though, can be a bit literal in his comments, such as this from Wednesday: “We are closer to a pause and it’s a matter of logic really,” he said. “As you increase interest rates, you get closer to the point where it is appropriate to stop for a while and assess the flow of data.” He’s right, of course, but it’s a bit like saying “we are getting closer to the next ice age”, which in a sense is true. It just doesn’t tell you about when that age of ice will return, nor what happens in the meantime - such as a spike in global heating we seem hell-bent on achieving. Senate committee recommends national reconstruction fund be passed The Senate economics legislation committee has recommended the government’s national reconstruction fund bill be passed. On Thursday Labor and the Greens struck a deal to pass the bill in the lower house, provided the government make clear in amendments that directly investing in new coal and gas projects, gas pipelines, and native forest logging could not be supported by the $15bn fund. Labor still needs two votes to pass the bill in the Senate, most likely either Lidia Thorpe and David Pocock or the Jacqui Lambie Network. This morning the industry minister, Ed Husic, was careful not to take their votes for granted. None of those balance of power senators were on the inquiry, though, so the report doesn’t give us hints as to how they’ll vote. The Labor majority supported it while the Greens supported the bill, subject to the amendments. The Coalition senators dissented, warning the NRF could contribute to inflation, cannot give grants, only coinvestment, and is “riddled with ministerial discretion” about which sectors to invest in. Anthony Albanese’s response to the latest comments from Beijing amounted to a defence of Aukus. Ahead of the announcement of the nuclear-powered submarine plans in the US early next week, the prime minister said there was nothing contradictory between seeking a more stable diplomatic relationship with China while also investing to “ensure that Australia’s defence assets are the best they can be”. It’s worth pointing out that the comments from China’s foreign ministry overnight - while strongly worded - are not a new position. Beijing has been pretty consistent in criticising the Aukus arrangement with the US and the UK. Back in October 2021 - the month after the original Aukus unveiling - the foreign ministry said the deal would “create nuclear proliferation risks, undermine the international non-proliferation system” and risked opening “Pandora’s Box”. Compare the Chinese foreign ministry’s statement then: The Aukus trilateral security partnership embodies the Cold War mentality, double standards and contempt of rules with a clear political agenda. It aims to introduce major-power confrontation and bloc politics into the region, provoke bloc confrontation and force regional countries to take sides … with the outdated Cold War mentality and compromise regional prosperity and stability. … to the one it made overnight: We urge the US, the UK and Australia to abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum games, honour international obligations in good faith and do more things that are conducive to regional peace and stability. The Australian government maintains that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty does not prohibit the nuclear-propelled (not nuclear-armed) submarine project. Albanese on the budget: defence must be paid for but it is ‘a solemn responsibility of government’ Ok the PM wraps up his presser by answering a series of quick questions from journalists, with the highlight being his take on the budget: On the budget, I don’t want you to have nothing to do and put your feet up between now and the budget. So we’ve made a range of announcements, so out of my concern for you, I would say that wait till you see what’s in the budget. But we’ve made it very clear when we speak about the pressures on the budget, that one of the areas is defence. So, I say to the Coalition that seem to oppose everything as well, I [will] have more to say about that but – this does have to be paid for. The defence of our country is a solemn responsibility of government. And it is one that I take seriously, this is an investment in our security. And we’ll do what is necessary to keep our country secure. On the progress on the economy, I see that will move very quickly. Does current India/Australia relationship mean a bilateral agreement is coming? The next question is an interesting one: on whether the deepening relationship between Australia and India indicate that a future bilateral agreement could be on the table? Albanese: Look, what we’re doing is building up our relations between our two nations. And … these issues are, I think, should be viewed on their merits rather than down the track. That’s how you build confidence as well in each other. I now have met with Prime Minister Modi four times. More than four meetings, but on four separate occasions. In the first year of my prime ministership. I will welcome Prime Minister Modi to Australia in the first half of this year for the Quad leaders meeting. I’ll be back here in September for the G20 and then Prime Minister Modi has also invited me yesterday to undertake another bilateral visit to other regions in India at the end of the year. Albanese to encourage flow of economic activity between India and Australia The PM continues as questions being rattled off, the next being on the barriers for Australian businesses who are seeking to invest in India: We want to move, from the act that’s been agreed and went through our processes came into being last December to the CECA, the Comprehensive Economic Co-operation Agreement. What that will mean is that we [will] ensure there’s a smoother flow of economic activity between our two nations. The businesses who are here aren’t here because … this is a wonderful country to visit … they’re working. They’re here because they see an economic interest in their companies expanding influence here. Companies like the Commonwealth bank talking about 500 people working at Barangaroo, and there’s a range of … businesses [that] will be investing – that is why they’re here. Albanese says Australia investing in defence capability but also relationships OK, next question is about China calling on Australia to end the “Cold War mentality” that they say is behind the Aukus deal. Albanese says it is important Australia invest in its military capacity: What I say is we’re investing in capability as we should, but we’re also investing in relationships as we are. It is not a contradictory position. It’s a consistent position. We need to ensure that Australia’s defence assets are the best they can be. And that we build our capability. At the same time, we need to build relationships. That’s what I’ve been doing. I’ve been doing that here in India, we’re doing that throughout the Indo-Pacific, we’ve done that as well, improved our relationship with China in recent times as well. Asked about press freedom in India, Albanese says issues will be raised ‘privately and appropriately’ Next question is if the PM is concerned about press freedom in India, and if he will bring it up with Prime Minister Modi, after a BBC office was raided after airing a documentary critical of Modi. The PM reiterates that he thinks India is a “great democracy”: Penny Wong commented on that when she was here as foreign minister last week. What I do in dealing diplomatically with people I have relationships with is I have discussions based upon Australia’s values and I’m consistent about that. Australia stands up for press freedom. But India is a great democracy. And to dismiss that is I think wrong. India has - has been and continues to be a democratic nation. And we will, where there’s differences, or issues, to be raised, we raise them privately and appropriately. PM answers question on India and Russia A journalist has jumped in and interrupted the PM, who has taken the question, on India’s relationship with Russia: India is a sovereign nation. And they depend their relationships with other nations based upon as they see fit. What’s important is how we deal as a sovereign nation with friends in our neighbourhood. And India is a friend of Australia. We have an increasingly important relationship which goes to our economic ties, our cultural ties, but also our ties through exercises like the Malabar exercises that will take place later this year. We also have as part of the announcements as well, we’ve had the participation of Australian defence personnel here in India, and exchange the other way around as well. That builds on the people to people relations that we have with India. India is an important democracy. India stands up for democracy. And I think that the relationship is a very positive one. Albanese outlines ‘three themes’ of India trip The PM continues, saying he expects to sign agreements with Modi today, and is listing the “three themes” of his visit to India, which include cultural ties, national security and economic ties: I expect today to sign agreements with Prime Minister Modi around the three themes of this visit … and the three themes in which we’re building relations. Firstly, cultural ties, we saw yesterday the cultural expression through sport, but there are many other ways as well … including arts and culture, and we’ll have more to say about that after the dialogue takes place today. In economic areas, we’ll also have agreements including in clean energy, we think in particular in solar, there’s enormous opportunities. I spoke to one of the major Indian companies here yesterday who are looking at billions of dollars of investment in Australia, including the manufacturing of solar panels. Something we’ve been talking about, something we want to promote through the national reconstruction fund: I want a future made in Australia. The third element is national security. And yesterday I had the great privilege of being on the first ever aircraft carrier built here in India, those relations between Australia and India are very important, we’ll host the Malabar exercises later this year and we’ll have more to say about that. PM lays out day’s schedule in India Prime minister Anthony Albanese has stepped up for a press conference from India, where he begins by saying it is a “new day” for relations between the two countries. The PM takes us through the program today, which includes a ceremonial welcome, as well as the laying of a wreathe in tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, a meeting with the India foreign minister, a one-on-one meeting with Prime Minister Modi, a business lunch and a speech at the Indian Institute of Technology. As the PM talks through the schedule, he continues to highlight the importance of the relationship between the two countries: This is the beginning of a new day on what has been an exceptionally successful visit up to this point. I’m sure that today will reinforce that successful building of relationships between Australia and India. We’ve got a busy program today. We begin with a ceremonial welcome from Prime Minister Modi. I do thank him for the personal way in which he has engaged with me so far on this visit. And today we’ll be spending most of the day together and I thank him for giving me the honour of a ceremonial welcome here to New Delhi. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, has weighed in on the alleged racial abuse faced by South Sydney star Latrell Mitchell last night. Perrottet, who is on the campaign trail before the NSW election on 25 March, said the NRL should issue a life ban to the fan who was allegedly abusing Mitchell: There is no place for racism at sporting games or anywhere in NSW. When it happens, it should be stamped out immediately. There should be life bans in place and I call on the NRL to take that action. We’ve got to take leadership here and we’ve seen sporting codes take action to stamp this behaviour out whenever it happens. I don’t care how old the person is who is involved in racist behaviour at sporting events. It’s a disgrace. It should be stamped out and there should be life bans in place and I call on the NRL to do it. China’s foreign ministry has issued a response to news Australia will be buying up to five US-made submarines and use British-designed vessels, as part of the Aukus deal. Spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters of China’s opposition to the deal, saying it “exacerbates [the] arms race” and “hurts peace and stability” in the region. This trilateral cooperation constitutes serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines the international non-proliferation system, exacerbates [the] arms race and hurts peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific. We urge the US, the UK and Australia to abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum games, honour international obligations in good faith and do more things that are conducive to regional peace and stability. Attorney general won’t comment on reports of ‘growing frustration’ in Indigenous voice working group The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has declined to comment on reports he “tried to water down” the proposed constitutional amendment for the voice to parliament, as a key member of the working group states the Indigenous consultation body needed to be “as strong as possible”. Dreyfus, who sits in meetings of the referendum working group, reportedly suggested changes to the power of the voice to advise “executive government”, according to the Australian newspaper. The News Corp paper also reported that a member of the group described Dreyfus’s suggestion as “overreach” and that there was “growing frustration” among members that the government wasn’t providing the group with timely advice. At a press conference in Newcastle, Dreyfus said he wouldn’t comment on deliberations of the working group. “What I can say is that the government will be bringing a constitution alteration bill to the parliament by the end of this month and that will end the speculation that we’ve had,” he said. “That bill will be debated in the Australian parliament and we’re looking forward to the constitution alteration bill passing both houses of the Australian parliament by the end of June.” Dreyfus noted that the PM, Anthony Albanese, had invited comments from anyone with suggestions about the voice and the referendum. “We’re still getting towards the end of that process. Now, many people have made suggestions and we’re looking forward to getting the final advice of the reference group that the government has been working with of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders,” he said. Dreyfus said he hadn’t heard the allegations about the government not providing timely advice. “I’m not going to comment on what’s happened inside the working group. I know that it’s been thus far, a very productive process. I’d refer you to the communiques that have been published by the working group. the government’s intention on setting up this working group was to receive the views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders. And we’ve been doing that, and that process is continuing.” Referendum working group member marcus stewart, the co-chair of the First Peoples’ Assembly of Victoria, said after the meeting there was “no room for mediocrity in this process”. “We are committed to ensuring the amendment is as strong as possible, as the Australian public and Aboriginal communities would expect,” he said. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you to take you through the rest of the day’s news. Thanks for your attention today. I leave you in the excellent hands of Mostafa Rachwani. Have a great weekend! School kids out of hospital, substance still a mystery More than a dozen children hospitalised after eating an unknown substance on a north Queensland school bus have been released after a night of medical care, AAP reports. Police and the education department are investigating how 22 students, aged between eight and 12, consumed the substance, reportedly in lollies, before feeling unwell at the Bluewater state school in Townsville on Thursday. Paramedics said the children were treated for symptoms including nausea, abdominal pain and lightheadedness. All 15 Bluewater state schoolchildren being treated by the Townsville hospital and Health Service were discharged from care today, the hospital said in a statement. Bluewater state school said it could not provide further details due to privacy issues. Queensland police and the Department of Education have been contacted for comment on the investigation. Nicotine use jumped 30% in early pandemic Nicotine consumption in Australia increased by 30% in the early stages of the Covid pandemic, new research suggests. Analysis of data from the national wastewater drug monitoring program found that while nicotine consumption in Australia had been decreasing between 2017 and 2019, it was significantly higher in the first half of 2020 than the second half of 2019. The study’s lead researcher, associate professor Phong Thai of the University of Queensland, said the increases coincided with the first wave of Covid and the introduction of lockdowns and remote working. Thai said in a statement: These changes could have increased nicotine consumption due to people managing higher stress levels, as well as greater opportunities to smoke or vape whilst working from home … Tobacco and nicotine consumption have been decreasing in Australia, however the Covid-19 pandemic may have temporarily disrupted this trend. The study was published in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research. A traveller has been fined $3,300 for trying to bring in a coconut shell, seed pods, betel nut, mustard sticks, shells and coral into Australia. The agriculture minister, Murray Watt, said the items are prohibited under biosecurity laws. Abdo said the game will do “all it can” to prevent any further incidents but would not say at this stage what actions might be taken because they don’t yet have all the details surrounding the incident. We will do all we can to make sure we leave the game better than we found it. That means these types of incidents are not occurring. A reporter asks Abdo if he has personally been in touch with Latrell Mitchell: I have not spoken to him directly. I have reached out to him and we’ve exchanged texts. He knows that he has my support and he acknowledged that. I have spoken to the club CEO, Blake Solly. I commend the way in which both South Sydney and the Penrith Panthers have dealt with the situation. As I said, it is commendable and something to be proud of around how the game rallies together in these types of situations. Let’s be honest, these types of things hurt. Latrell is a human being. Comments like these affect us whether or not we want to admit … [but] he knows the game stands behind him. I think he is gaining a lot of strength from the support he has from everyone inside the game. Abdo says the NRL will also be using the incident as an opportunity for greater education: This is also an opportunity for us to educate people as well. While we might take strong action, we use this as an opportunity to educate people who require it around what is acceptable, not only at rugby league games but in our society more generally. Speaking up ‘is the only way we’re going to eradicate’ vilification and abuse: NRL CEO Abdo: Again, I want to commend him and all the players who speak up and take action. I want to encourage anyone in our game to do exactly the same thing. It is the only way we’re going to eradicate these types of unfortunate incidents our game. I also want to support the players that do a great job for us. It is not just the players, it’s all participants – all officials in the game, all volunteers and all fans. Everybody deserves to be respected. Everybody deserves to be made to feel comfortable in our game. One of the things we love about rugby league is the genuine inclusivity that exists. When issues like this happen, just know we will deal with them and deal with them thoroughly … We are cooperating with the police, we will get to the bottom of the facts and make sure the appropriate action and appropriate process follows once we have all the details. The NRL CEO, Andrew Abdo, has stepped up in Sydney to respond to a fan allegedly making a racial slur against Rabbitohs player Latrell Mitchell at last night’s game. It is abhorrent when we have player subjected to any form of vilification or abuse. Whether that be racial abuse or any form of vilification, it is completely unacceptable. What I am pleased about is the way the game always rallies behind anyone in the game affected by this. I want to commend in this particular example Latrell Mitchell for his leadership, for calling out this action. Not just him, all players last night from both teams who worked together to assist the stadium, the NRL officials, the police and everyone in getting all the facts and making sure these types of situations don’t happen in the future. It takes a lot of courage to do that. Plibersek under pressure to force companies to cut back on plastic waste The environment minister is under mounting pressure to force industry to deal with the waste it produces and stop relying on voluntary targets, AAP reports. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson’s frustrations boiled over while grilling senior officials about voluntary targets under an industry scheme. What gives you any confidence they are going to solve this problem when they literally haven’t given a shit about it for decades? He was referring to targets entrusted to the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation, whose members include thousands of businesses from packaging manufacturers and major retailers to international brands. Environment department senior executive Kate Lynch agreed some of the “ambitious” targets would not be met. But having the targets in place is still a useful exercise. The Greens senator asked when the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, would decide it was time to “step in and regulate”. He also questioned how Australia could back a legally binding international treaty on plastic pollution, while doing nothing like that at home. Don’t you see an irony in that? Assistant climate change minister, Jenny McAllister, said the government did not think the progress to date had been adequate. But she said two things were going on. Our intention to be a good international citizen, and play our part in driving international action. But it’s also our intention to work hard on our national environment, to get our house in order. Labor senator and assistant minister for Indigenous Australians and Indigenous health, Malarndirri McCarthy, has created history today by being the first Indigenous Australian woman to deliver Australia’s national statement to the United Nations commission on the status of women in New York, according to a media statement. McCarthy delivered Australia’s national statement and said that tackling gender inequality was crucial. The theme of the United Nations forum was “Innovation and technological change, and education in the digital age for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls”. The statement included the importance of technology and innovation and closing the digital gap, particularly for First Nations women and those living in regional and remote areas. McCarthy told the UN that the Albanese government will deliver on an election promise to introduce a national strategy to achieve gender equality. We know that good outcomes for women are good for the nation and that’s why we are energised and ready to take on the hard work needed to achieve the change necessary for women and girls. As a Yanyuwa Garrawa woman from Gulf Country in the Northern Territory, I’m incredibly proud and humbled to represent all Australian women and girls with this distinguished delegation on the world stage. Australia is serious about achieving gender equality, and we are committed to working with partners across our region and the globe to achieve long-lasting change for women and girls. Severe thunderstorms predicted for Queensland The Bureau of Meteorology says thunderstorms and heavy rainfall are possible around large parts of the state, particularly the central interior, today. One in five patients reject life-saving heart medicine in US, study shows People with high cholesterol are refusing to take prescribed heart medicine, a new study has found, prompting calls for better cardiovascular health awareness, AAP reports. The study, which reviewed the medical data of millions of US citizens, found one in five people at high risk of heart disease are not taking statin therapy. Statins work by lowering the amount of cholesterol in the blood, preventing the fat from accumulating and blocking a person’s coronary arteries. The study also found women were more likely to refuse statins when prescribed them than men, resulting in poorer health outcomes. The findings have serious implications for the 6.5 million Australians – including 3.6 million women – who live with high cholesterol, says Heart Foundation Healthcare programs manager Natalie Raffoul: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death among Australian women second only to dementia. Statin therapy is the gold-standard, first-line, cholesterol-lowering medication prescribed for high-risk individuals to help reduce their chances of having a heart attack or stroke. If you are prescribed statins by your GP … it’s crucial that you consider taking these medicines, which are commonly regarded as having been critical to the reduction in cardiovascular death in Australia over the last 50 years. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in Australia, responsible for more than one in four lives lost. Recent research confirmed fears Covid-19 exacerbated poor heart health, because lockdowns deprived Australians of opportunities to exercise. The study by the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute found cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure levels were all significantly higher than before the pandemic. Raffoul said more work was needed to understand why patients were reluctant to take statins and what can be done to improve its uptake. Five fires burning out of control in NSW, RFS reports There are five fires burning in NSW which the rural fire service have yet to bring under control. In an update of the fire situation across the state as at 9am this morning, the RFS said the 30 fires burning are giving crews over 200kms of active fire edge to battle. University of Melbourne announces science degree partnership with three Indian universities The University of Melbourne has announced a dual science degree with three Indian universities, in the latest major education partnership between the two nations. The new bachelor of science dual degree will enable Indian students to complete their course at home and abroad, spending the first two years in India followed by two years in Melbourne. Once they complete their studies, Indian students will be awarded a bachelor of science from the University of Melbourne, and have the option for their local institution to award the degree. The dual degree was announced on a prime ministerial trade delegation in Mumbai by vice-chancellor Duncan Maskell, who said the University of Madras, Savitribai Phule Pune University and GITAM were the first partners of the degree, with discussions under way to expand from 2024. With demand for our existing programs continuing to grow, we’re pleased to be working together with prestigious local universities to be part of the internationalisation of education in India and at home in Australia. Prof Dr Karbhari Vishwanath Kale, vice-chancellor of SPPU, said the dual degree would give greater flexibility to its domestic students. They can pursue further graduate studies to earn a fast-tracked masters, as well as graduate employment in Australia under expanded visa schemes, or return to India or elsewhere with an advanced degree aligned to those offered by leading institutions in North America and Europe. Doubled funding to fight poverty if Labor elected in NSW The leading anti-poverty and social services organisations in NSW can expect double its permanent funding under Labor if it wins the upcoming state election, AAP reports. Labor has pledged an additional $1.3m in funding to the NSW Council of Social Services if it wins government at the 25 March poll. It would lift the peak body’s annual funding to $2.5m, topping up its core funding of $1.2m through NSW Health and the Department of Communities and Justice. The Labor leader, Chris Minns, said today: NSW is committed to supporting our community sector and the invaluable work that they do each and every day across our state. The work that Ncoss does is vital to provide a voice to those in NSW experiencing disadvantage and poverty. Ncoss CEO, Joanna Quilty, said the government funding was significantly less per capita than its state and territory counterparts, but she welcomed the pledge. It’s going to make a huge difference. NSW isn’t out of the woods yet. There are more households out there who are really struggling. And we’ve got a social service sector that is really struggling itself under the weight of rising demand. This additional funding will boost our efforts to ensure that these issues are front and centre for the next government. There were 3,319 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and one person is in intensive care. Those numbers are up from last week’s 3,016 cases and 23 deaths. There were 7,871 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and 18 people are in intensive care. The case numbers are the highest recorded in the state since 20 January. Cases are up on last week’s 7,163, as well as all February case numbers which were all within the 6,600-6,000 range. The deaths recorded are slightly higher than the 29 recorded last week. Taking the blog to India for a moment where the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is continuing his four day tour. Paying a visit to the new aircraft carrier INS Vikrant at the invitation of Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, Albanese yesterday declared India a “top tier security partner” and vowed to deepen military ties between the two nations: A partnership that is of increasing strategic importance as we navigate the challenges of our region together. For Australia, India is a top tier security partner. The Indian Ocean is central to both countries’ security and prosperity. And there has never been a point in both of our country’s histories where we’ve had such a strong strategic alignment. Albanese also announced India will join the Australian defence force’s flagship military games Operation Talisman Sabre: I am pleased to announce formally… that later this year Australia will host Exercise Malabar for the first time and India will – also for the first time – participate in Australia’s Talisman Sabre exercise. It will be a great privilege to welcome India’s Navy to Australia in August and I thank them again for hosting me here today. Albanese will sit down with Modi for formal talks today. Just circling back to Peter Dutton saying there was no rebuke from the British high commissioner Vicki Treadell. To clarify what those “silly reports” are that Dutton referred to, they were comments made publicly while Treadell was speaking at the National Press Club on Wednesday. Treadell said on Wednesday that she spoke to Dutton on Tuesday night and told him she did not agree with his view: He is commenting on an outcome he doesn’t yet know. There is a lot of speculation, everyone is entitled to speculate. I was simply pointing out that I did not think such expressions were helpful on what is a genuine trilateral partnership started under his government. Rabbitohs to file police report over alleged racial abuse of Latrell Mitchell South Sydney intend to file a police report after a teenage NRL fan allegedly racially abused fullback Latrell Mitchell at half-time of the Rabbitohs’ loss to Penrith, AAP reports. Rabbitohs club officials alleged the fan targeted Mitchell with a racist comment on Thursday as he walked up the tunnel at BlueBet Stadium and into the dressing sheds. The fan allegedly left the scene after making the comment but a man who had been sitting with him, believed to have been his father, was ejected by security. Read the full story here: Dutton gives ‘full credit’ to defence minister over new subs deal Opposition leader Peter Dutton was on the Today Show at the same time as Marles and echoed the bipartisan support for the new deal, giving “full credit to Richard [Marles]”. Dutton is asked about the comments the British high commissioner made while speaking at the National Press Club on Wednesday. in which she said she told Dutton Tuesday night she did not agree with his views rallying against nuclear subs from the UK. However, Dutton goes on to deny that the British high commissioner rebuked him: I saw those silly reports. I had a very pleasant catch-up with the high commissioner and there was no rebuke, nothing more than a conversation about staying engaged for once the detail was announced next week. She said no such thing, just to put that into perspective, and I have confirmed that with her by text yesterday so I wouldn’t believe that media speculation. My concern first and foremost is support a decision in our country’s best interest not in any other country’s best interest. What is best for Australia. What is best for Australia is we have the Virginia-class capability because, as I say, it is an established type, it is not going to have cost overruns and time blowouts and time really is of the essence. We shouldn’t kid ourselves about what we face in the region at the moment and if that gives longer time for a new design to be worked up and the problems to be ironed out, well, that’s a good thing and, as Richard rightly points outlet, the capability of the Collins class submarine takes us into the 2040s as well. There is no capability gap and we can acquire the submarine that will really help train up the workforce because the workforce is going to be the next biggest issue, getting people trained on nuclear submarines. It is important for Australia to take a bit of a lead because we are in the middle of any impending war that comes. ‘Nothing which gives any adversary a second thought more than a capable submarine’: Marles The defence minister and acting PM, Richard Marles, is speaking to the Today Show as Australia looks set to buy at least three nuclear submarines from the US as part of the Aukus deal. Marles says the big announcement will come next week, and acknowledges the bipartisan effort that’s led Australia to taking “the biggest step forward in our military capability since the end of the second world war”. On whether the submarines will be here in time given reporting from the Nine newspapers that Australia could be at war with China in three years, Marles says: I want to give people a sense of confidence that the submarines that we have right now, the Collins-class submarines, are really capable submarines in 2023. So, we have a capability. I have spent time on those submarines and it’s a very good capability, but the question is whether or not it will be the same capability in the mid-2030s, which is why we’ve got to think about that now, and really, the whole steps we are taking here is about making sure that, with our submarine capabilities, we are able to grow that, that it remains potent, because there is nothing which gives any adversary a second thought more than a capable submarine which is why it is so important that we are bringing to bear this capability in the future. More flying coffees forecast as Google tests drone tech Australians could see many more coffees flying around the suburbs after Google announced plans to test technology designed to load its drones and boost the number of airborne deliveries, AAP reports. The tech giant’s drone arm, Wing, which operates in the skies above Canberra and Logan City, on Brisbane’s south, revealed plans to trial new advances today, including a device to let drones collect goods without human assistance. If the tests succeed, Wing chief executive, Adam Woodworth, said the company could ramp up its flying deliveries and expand their reach in 2024. The announcement comes just five months after Wing expanded its operations in partnership with food delivery service DoorDash, letting customers order up to 1kg of goods to be delivered by air to their home. The company’s latest technology would include new software to create an autonomous drone traffic network and devices called Autoloaders. These devices would store packages drones could collect without help from a human assistant – an advance Woodworth said could significantly boost the speed and simplicity of drone deliveries. Husic: reconstruction fund can provide capital for new ways of generating energy Husic has been saying the fund was never about coal or gas, but the fund can invest in renewable energy. Karvelas asks why that is when it’s not manufacturing. Husic: If we’ve got new ways of generating energy and we need to manufacture the technology for that to occur, then the fund is there to be able to back there and provide the capital for that type of activity. The prime minister often cites rightly we had a lot of the intellectual property on solar panels generated in this country, in some cases just out of the union and other parts of the nation, but then we shipped off the idea to someone else to finish it off as a manufactured product, and then we import it back in. And we’re talking about well, how can we get more of that activity on shore with the challenges we’ve got with climate change and reducing emissions? And if we can find a way to manufacture the components required for renewable energy onshore, then we want to be able to support that through the fund. Husic pressed on logging issue Karvelas starts to ask Husic about logging being banned in the amendment according to the deal but Husic says “no it hasn’t”. Husic then apologises for interrupting citing “my typical Balkan reaction”. Karvelas presses on, saying, “Let me, let me Greek-Australian you”: What do you mean? You just added the amendment. Logging all of a sudden is in it. Logging is a billion-dollar industry in Tasmania. Are you prepared to offer the Jacqui Lambie Network or Tasmania something in exchange? Husic Logging will continue where state governments and territories allow for that type of activity to occur. What we’re talking about is value add, where do we go for value add in resources and agriculture along with all the other priority areas in there and turn that into manufacturing? So the act itself, as I said, wherever it occurs, it’ll keep going and I just reacted in terms of where you were framing up the question Patricia, just around the whole notion that this will stop logging – it won’t, it will continue. And some of the reactions I’ve seen, you’ve just got to raise your eyebrows and move on to the next thing. This is really a fund that is focused on making sure we can do more on shore. Instead of just doing what we’ve done in times past it, taking a moment to think ‘OK, what can we do differently with this add value, instead of sending it off and pulling it back higher price and not having manufacturing self sufficiency available to us in this country when we’ve got some self sufficiency in the OECD? Karvelas sums it up saying logging and coal and gas were never going to be in it anyway, but Husic agreed to the amendment. Despite the fact it’s the amendment concerning Tammy Tyrrell, Husic said they won’t back down after making an agreement with the Greens. Minister defends reconstruction fund deal The industry minister, Ed Husic, is speaking to ABC Radio following his bill for his reconstruction fund passing the lower house and heading for the Senate after the government agreed to the Greens demand to ban the fund from investment in coal and native logging projects. RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas is asking Husic about comments from the Jacqui Lambie network Senator Tammy Tyrrell who says giving into the Greens on native logging is a smack in the face to Tasmanians and that it’s a broken promise. Husic said he’s had “good discussions so far” with the Jacqui Lambie Network and other crossbenchers and the Greens as well where we’ve taken things on board. When the Greens raised their concerns, initially around coal and gas. We had said a number of times this fund is about manufacturing. It’s not about extraction. It’s not about logging, either. And if the Greens needed that assurance in writing via an amendment, so be it and that’s what’s happened. But at its heart the fund remains unchanged from what we had said before, which is we want to revitalise manufacturing capability we need to invest in that’s what this fund will do. Final robodebt hearing shines light on people affected A Centrelink employee and a customer impacted by the illegal robodebt scheme will be the final two witnesses appearing at the royal commission’s public hearings, AAP reports. Today’s hearing will complete a marathon three weeks of evidence from former coalition ministers, senior public servants and the independent watchdog. The fourth block of hearings examined a 2017 investigation by the Commonwealth Ombudsman into the scheme, proposals to expand robodebt, the impact it had on victims and how it was eventually wound up. A final report will be handed down by the end of June, after the commission was granted an extension to its April deadline. You can read more about yesterday’s hearings from Luke Henriques-Gomes: ‘We have slipped down the international rankings on paid parental leave’ The inquiry also recommended moving towards 52 weeks of paid parental leave – way beyond what the federal government is proposing. Pocock said: The international standard now in the OECD area is beyond 52 weeks. It’s great we’re moving to 26 but we are not going fast enough, doing what other countries are doing. We have slipped down the international rankings on paid parental leave. It’s very important that we give the support to parents when a new baby arrives so they can share the leave, they can begin life with a new child, give that child the best shot and alongside that, of course, we need quality, early childhood education and care which we in the Greens think should be free, just like primary school. Right to disconnect recommended Another key recommendation was the right for workers to disconnect from mobiles after working hours, which Pocock said there was great support for during hearings around the country. A lot of support as we went around the country with our hearings. We’ve got really significant changes in the technology of our work. They’re very liberating. It means we can work in different places, we’re untethered from the office. But lot of people are finding they’re very tethered to the phone. They find themselves in the playground with their four-year-old on the weekend with an urgent text or a request from their workplace. What people are saying is, can we work our working hours and once we’re beyond those, unless it’s absolutely urgent, we should be able to turn the phone off and not be at its beck and call. Lots of countries are doing this – Europe has working time standards which say people should have the right to disconnect. We have some enterprise agreements in Australia. Our committee is saying, we need to move in that direction. In news which seems extremely appealing on a Friday, a Senate committee is recommending that parliament consider the case for a four-day working week. Greens senator Barbara Pocock was the chair of the work and care inquiry, which was tasked with looking into ways workplace laws could be adapted to better suit people with caring responsibilities in a way that boosts productivity. Pocock has spoken to ABC News Breakfast this morning about the evidence the inquiry heard: We heard a lot of evidence … of people who are already working a four-day week in workplaces that are trialling a reduction in working hours and getting very positive results. They work on a model of 100% of pay, 80% of working time, and 100% of productivity. We’re seeing in the evidence improvements in productivity, a lot greater, work and family balance, and really good outcomes in the workplace and at home in terms of relationships and putting your life and your job together. What we propose, in this report, we propose further pilots. Let’s look at the workplaces that are up for experimentation and properly monitoring it and building it. In our history, Australia led the world in reductions in the working week in the 1850s. We’re at the other end of the spectrum with too many Australians working very long hours. We need to think more seriously about how we deal with a changed workforce. That’s just one of the ideas we’re saying, we should look at. We need to be ambitious. Supplies flown in to help stranded Queensland flood victims The number of evacuations and isolations are increasing across northwest Queensland as flooding blankets parts of the state and neighbouring Northern Territory, AAP reports. Fears of further flooding has towns on edge with ongoing thunderstorms and possible heavy rainfall forecast across northwestern, central and southern districts today. Essential supplies for the stranded community of Doomadgee landed from Cairns on Thursday, with resupplies planned. A flood watch was issued for the Gulf Country and parts of the Lake Eyre Basin Rivers, which includes the Flinders and Cloncurry River catchments. A major flood warning was in place for the lower Flinders Rivers and a minor warning issued for Cloncurry River which was expected to reach a minor flood level of three metres overnight. The Bureau of Meteorology said in a statement: Several flood peaks continue to move along the Cloncurry and Flinders Rivers, and further rises are likely at Walkers Bend over the next few days. The Albert river at Burketown, west of Doomadgee, was tipped to exceed the March 2011 record flood level of 6.78m from late Friday. Major flood warnings were also in place for the Nicholson, Gregory and Leichhardt rivers, with further falls of potentially more than 100 millimetres expected over catchments. Falls of 200mm-400mm were widespread in the week leading up to Thursday, with parts of the Gulf of Carpentaria receiving more than 400mm of rain. Century Mine and Riversleigh both recorded over 500mm. The Mount Isa Local Disaster Management Group declared it was in “lean forward” status and ready to respond to emergencies. Tambaroora blaze downgraded The NSW Rural Fire Service has downgraded a fire in the central west of the state to an advice warning for the first time since Monday. The size of the blaze reached 15,694 ha at Tambaroora, where crews will now evaluate damage today. Good morning! Thanks to Martin for kicking things off, Natasha May now with you. Albanese talks trade in India Crucial trade talks with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, will be the focus of Anthony Albanese’s third day in India, where Australia seeks to reap the benefits of the Asian nation’s decarbonisation, Australian Associated Press reports. The pair will meet for their annual leaders’ summit in New Delhi on Friday, with renewable energy and technology to feature on the agenda along with defence and security. India has set ambitious goals of 50% renewable energy and 30% electric vehicle usage by 2030. Australia’s trade minister, Don Farrell, who’s leading a business delegation on the trip, said Australia could help India as it goes green. They’re very interested in our critical minerals but they’re also interested in the supply of hydrogen, which of course will take the place of gas as we transition to a decarbonised economy. India and Australia are also expected to sign an agreement to bring their film industries closer together. Albanese said: For me, films are food for the soul … they tell stories, help us to feel, and reflect who we are and where we come from. I look forward to seeing more Indian-Australian co-productions on our screens showcasing the best of both our cultures, landscapes and people. He will also address the Indian Institute of Technology about opportunities to strengthen higher education links, holding a question and answer session with students. The institute has partnerships with several Australian universities. In an interview with the ABC’s 7.30 program last night, Kevin Rudd said recent brash rhetoric from the Chinese government could be partly attributed to China’s own domestic challenges, including slow economic growth and pressure over its Covid measures. Rudd added: The overall state of the US-China relationship is in bad strategic repair. But as Foreign Minister [Penny] Wong said recently in a speech here in the United States, our job as friends, partners and allies of the United States, and as strategic partners with China, is to encourage both Beijing and Washington to move in the direction of a new strategic framework of managed strategic competition to build new strategic guardrails into their relationships so that we do not end up with a crisis, escalation and war by accident. That I think is a responsibility we share with all US allies around the world and partners of China. Asked about former Labor prime minister Paul Keating’s claims that the US is engaged in an attempt to contain China, Rudd said he had “a lot of time for Paul” but the strategic environment was changing because of China’s own military rise: Certainly what drives, I think, Australian strategic thinking is how do we deter our friends in China from taking premeditated military action against Taiwan, which will then be a fundamental destabilisation of the strategic status quo? The full transcript of the interview, posted on Rudd’s website, also shows this revealing comment about his appointment: One of the reasons which Prime Minister [Anthony] Albanese explained to me why he and the foreign minister asked me to do this job is because we’re all anxious about the current state of great power relations in the world. And therefore, if I can play some very small role in our own dealings with the administration in Washington in helping to provide advice on how things might be stabilised in one way or another, then I’ll play that small role, but only on the basis of guidance and instructions from Canberra. That’s the job of an ambassador. Morning and welcome to our live blog of the Australian news day. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be bringing you a few of the stories making the news this morning before my colleague Natasha May takes over. Anthony Albanese will have talks with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, today as he continues his visit to the world’s largest democracy. The pair will meet for their annual leaders’ summit in New Delhi, with renewable energy and technology to feature on the agenda along with defence and security. It follows his participation in a bizarre moment of political theatre with Modi before the start of the fourth Test in Ahmedabad last night. In a pageant akin to a politcal rally, the Australian prime minister performed a lap of honour with his host around the stadium on a craft adorned with “a splayed cardboard fan of oversized cricket bats and stumps”. One of Albanese’s predecessors, Kevin Rudd, who is about to start his new role as Australian ambassador to Washington, says the relationship between the US and China was in “bad strategic repair”. One of the reasons the government had appointed him, he told ABC’s 7.30 last night, was because “we’re all anxious about the current state of great power relations in the world” and did not want a war to start by “accident”. Residents in central New South Wales will awake this morning with the prospect of a huge bushfire burning through an area near Mudgee “for weeks”, according to an assessment by the Rural Fire Service. “It is ginormous, intimidating and overwhelming, even for people who are miles away from the fire front,” said Angela Burford, a communications officer at the RFS."

                    "bodyText": "Good morning. For the past seven years, the relationship between France and the UK has been marred by post-Brexit tensions that have created rows over everything from fishing rights to immigration. During her leadership campaign, Liz Truss said that the “jury was still out” on whether Emmanuel Macron was a friend or a foe – and under Boris Johson relations between the two countries plummeted to historic lows, with Macron reportedly referring to Johnson in private as a “clown” in charge of a “circus”. The war in Ukraine has put things sharply back in focus however, and reinvigorated the appetite to move towards a new, more cooperative, dynamic. Rishi Sunak will meet with Macron today to discuss an array of issues in the first bilateral summit in five years. The agenda is jam packed: the refugee crisis in the Channel, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Iran’s nuclear programme, the environment, Brexit and more. Above all, they will show the world that Europe’s two biggest military powers are firmly aligned. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to the chief foreign editor of the French daily newspaper Libération, Sonia Delesalle-Stolper, about what this summit could tell us about the future of Franco-British relations. That’s right after the headlines. Five big stories Hamburg | At least seven people have been killed and dozens injured after a shooting at a Jehovah’s Witness centre in the northern German city of Hamburg. Police said on Thursday evening that the gunman was believed to be among the dead, and that a motive was as yet unclear. NHS | More than 500 seriously ill patients died last year before they could get treatment in hospital after the ambulance they called for took up to 15 hours to reach them, an investigation by the Guardian has revealed. The fatalities included people who had had a stroke or heart attack, or who had been involved in a road traffic collision. Ukraine | Ukrainian forces are still trying to hold Bakhmut, a city in the eastern Donetsk region, despite being pummelled on three sides by Russian forces. The city has become the centre of one of the longest and bloodiest battles since the war began. Meta | WhatsApp’s head has said it would not comply with Online Safety Bill requirements that attempt to outlaw end-to-end encryption. “There isn’t a way to change it in just one part of the world,” Will Cathcart said. “Some countries have chosen to block it: that’s the reality of shipping a secure product. But we’ve never seen a liberal democracy do that.” Boris Johnson | Boris Johnson has once again nominated Paul Dacre for a peerage as part of a pared-back resignation honours list, despite the Daily Mail chief having previously been rejected by the appointments watchdog, the Guardian has learned. In depth: ‘Negotiating and a good relationship is probably better than the antagonism we’ve seen over the past seven years’ Macron and Sunak share a lot of similarities: they are both relatively young, former investment bankers who went to elite schools and wear very well-tailored suits. Unlike the previous two prime ministers, Sunak shares an air of centre-right sensibility with Macron – they are polished, wealthy and are both seen to be protecting the interests of business above all else. Unfortunately for them, according to the latest polls this outward glossiness is struggling to win over voters, with both countries in the midst of aggressive strike action from unions. We will see today whether their similarities will help to heal the diplomatic rift that has developed over the last few years. *** The ice is thawing While Sunak is a relatively unknown figure to the French public, there is a clear understanding, Sonia Delesalle-Stolper says, that the mood has shifted because of his willingness to repair a badly damaged relationship: “There is suddenly, from Sunak’s government, the idea that actually discussing, negotiating and having a good relationship with your closest neighbour is probably better for everyone than the antagonism which we have seen over the past seven years.” *** What about Brexit? While Brexit remains a tiresome fixture in British political discourse, France has long since moved on it seems. “The interesting thing being a former UK correspondent and now a foreign editor in France is seeing how much Brexit is still in the minds of the UK and not at all in the common conversation or the newspapers in France,” Delesalle-Stolper says. This is not to say that France has not felt the repercussions of Brexit, Delesalle-Stolper says, pointing to the dramatic reduction in the number of school trips from France to the UK because of visa problems. “For lots of schools going to the UK to learn English and have fun for a week was the highlight of the year. All that has stopped,” Delesalle-Stolper explains. The same applies to older students who may want to do a year abroad and work in the UK before resuming their studies. Despite these everyday inconveniences though, Brexit is still peripheral in the French zeitgeist. “Even if you look at the coverage of the Windsor framework agreement, it’s there, but it’s minimal. It’s not front page news at all,” Delesalle-Stolper adds. *** Asylum seekers Sunak has made it a priority to “stop small boats” from crossing the Channel, unveiling an immigration bill to tackle the issue, that has since been condemned by the United Nations for “extinguishing the right to seek refugee protection in the UK”. Going into this summit, both Macron and Sunak are expected to agree to keep working together on the issue but they will probably hit an impasse as the UK believes that France is not doing enough and, unsurprisingly, France thinks the opposite. “France has the feeling that it’s done quite a lot to try to regulate and stop those boats from crossing the channel but the fact is Britain has completely blocked any legal asylum seeking routes so the only way they can get there is through the sea,” Delesalle-Stolper says. “France is dealing with many more asylum seekers than Britain and, the truth is, if they are trying to go to the UK there’s usually a real reason like they have some family there or they speak English.” (For more information, read Jon Henley’s brilliant explainer on how the two countries have been dealing with the small boats crisis). While there is inevitably some hostile rhetoric from far-right political parties and certain conservative politicians in France, Delesalle-Stolper says there is generally a greater understanding that asylum is a complex issue that “you can’t resolve by acting on your own because, obviously, the roots of the problems are far more global,” and the UK needs to be ready to come into a broader conversation about tackling the underlying causes as well as taking their fair share of refugees. According to French officials, Macron will reject all demands from the UK for a returns agreement for asylum seekers crossing the Channel, as it would be a politically toxic option for him. He is expected, however, to ask for a multi year settlement to help France deal with the crisis in the Channel. So, despite the new friendliness, any kind of agreement seems hard to reach. Ultimately, this summit is likely to mean far more symbolically than in concrete deals. But it is, at least, a first step towards greater cooperation between the two countries on the growing number of pressing problems they both face.

                    "bodyText": "The attempt by Rishi Sunak and Emmanuel Macron to reset the Anglo-French relationship on Friday is not just important bilaterally, but also in terms of Britain’s relationship with the EU. The French president, a gatekeeper to improved relations, sees the British prime minister’s efforts to resolve the Northern Ireland trade issues as a signal Britain is in the hands of a fellow technocratic nationalist, and that its brush with populism may be over. French diplomats were in despair over Boris Johnson’s willingness to use France as a prop to bolster his domestic standing, saying it corroded the trust that is at the heart of effective diplomacy. The low point probably came in November 2021 with Johnson’s release on Twitter of a letter to Macron after 27 people died trying to cross the Channel. The then prime minister in effect blamed the crisis on France and proposed it should commit to taking back all asylum seekers who made it to Britain, a suggestion the French government had already rejected multiple times. The letter led to the withdrawal of an invitation to the then home secretary, Priti Patel, to a summit on the refugee crisis. There had been similar fury two months earlier when Johnson told Macron to “donnez-moi un break” and get over his anger with the Aukus military pact signed between the UK, US and Australia in the Indo-Pacific. Johnson suggested Macron “prenez un grip” over the surprise Anglosphere pact to design and build nuclear-powered submarines for Australia, which required Canberra to dump a contract to buy diesel-powered subs from the French. By contrast Joe Biden, belatedly aware that the announcement of the pact had been terribly handled, took Macron’s sense of betrayal seriously. He met the French president in Rome a month later, signed a strategic interoperability agreement in December 2021 and a year later granted Macron a state visit to the White House. A test of Friday’s summit will be the ability of the two leaders to navigate these boat issues – the inflatable rafts coming across the Channel and the multibillion-pound nuclear submarines that Australia, the US and the UK intend to build to patrol in the Indo-Pacific. The small boats, a symbol of the wider migration crisis, have a short-term political urgency for Sunak, who will be seeking election in 2024. The replacement submarines, to counter the growing threat from China, are not due to be seaworthy until the 2040s. The difficulty in terms of small boats is that the sides only in November reached a laboriously negotiated settlement in which the UK provided €72.2m (£64m) in return for a 40% increase in patrols and more intelligence sharing. The only probable big advance at the summit will be that Britain’s ad hoc funding of French patrols will become multiyear funding, making it easier for the French to plan extra patrols. Each side would like the other to do more. Conservative MPs want France to arrest those caught trying to cross the Channel and for the British police to patrol on French beaches alongside the gendarmerie. France for its part would like the British to introduce ID cards and take more refugees. Neither side is going to relent. But it was noticeable that Sunak in making his latest announcements this week steered clear of blaming the French for the increase in the number of boats, saying no single lever would solve the problem. The EU’s statement on Wednesday that it does not believe the new British policy of rejecting any person if they arrive illegally by boat conforms with international law carries dangers. It risks Macron being cast in the role of accomplice of British lawbreaking if he endorses the UK’s plan. How he handles this will be a test of how eager the French president is to improve relations. The other test will be Aukus. Biden took the precaution of ringing Macron this week to brief him on details of where and how nuclear-powered submarines will be built, something he will announce on Monday in San Diego alongside Sunak and the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese. The event will be a bitter moment for Macron. Aukus involved Biden, as well as Canberra and London going behind Macron’s back to kill off Australia’s previous $66bn contract signed in 2016 to buy French subs. It was not just the deception of an ally, it was a blow to the centrepiece of French policy in the Indo-Pacific. Not even the €555m compensation given to the French naval group or visits by Albanese to Paris can heal the wounds. The risk is that the exclusion of France sharpens its instinct to approach China differently to the US and UK. In September, Macron told his diplomats about France’s distinctive position about the coming power struggle between China and the US. France was not equidistant between these superpowers, he argued, but at the same time did not have a confrontational mindset. Britain could play a role in binding France closer to US thinking on China. There has even been talk of Fraukus, the idea that France may join in the advanced technology sharing that is an essential part of Aukus. Another path for the UK to influence French thinking is to deepen defence cooperation with France and by extension Europe. The former national security adviser Peter Ricketts has suggested the UK and the EU could start that process by meeting regularly to discuss supply chain issues over China, foreign direct investment screening or export controls of advanced technologies. Britain’s integrated defence and foreign policy review in March 2021 had very little to say about British coordination with the EU on security issues. Structured defence cooperation with Europe may be a step too far for Sunak, but a revised post-Ukraine version is due to be published on Monday as the prime minister meets Biden. Ironically there is no politician more eager to see British European cooperation on defence than the American president."

Australia has found itself at the centre of great power geopolitics in Asia, with a promise to deepen military ties with India while drawing the ire of China over a nuclear submarine deal. Anthony Albanese, who has been visiting India this week, called Delhi “a top tier security partner” and announced the Indian military’s participation in the Australian defence force’s flagship war games in August. There was little fanfare in Beijing, however, at Australia’s reported decision to buy nuclear submarines from the US and UK. While Australia argues the new military assets will help it safeguard Indo-Pacific peace and stability, the view from China is that it will do the opposite. “This trilateral cooperation constitutes serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines the international non-proliferation system, exacerbates [the] arms race and hurts peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific,” a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said. Albanese is expected to formally announce the submarine deal on Monday, US time, when he meets the US president, Joe Biden, and the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in San Diego.

                    "bodyText": "In a nondescript office building in Canberra, hundreds of officials have spent months fine-tuning highly secretive plans for Australia to become just the seventh country in the world to have nuclear-powered submarines. The clocks on the walls show three times – Canberra, London and Washington – reflecting the fact Australia is depending on the United Kingdom and the United States to achieve what V Adm Jonathan Mead calls “a generational challenge” that will “redefine Australia’s strategic personality”. Even towards the end of the planning process, eight or nine working groups have been holding regular virtual teleconferences at night with US and UK counterparts, said Mead. “It is truly a trilateral pathway and trilateral partnership,” the head of the nuclear-powered submarine taskforce declares. ‘Not a binary choice’ Leaks out of the UK and the US this week have started to point to the outlines of a deal that will be officially announced in San Diego on Monday, US time. The Guardian has reported the long-term Aukus plan would likely involve a British submarine design with heavy use of American technology – an outcome also reported by Bloomberg. But that does not preclude a US interim solution to plug a potential capability gap caused by the retirement of Australia’s existing Collins class conventional submarines from the late 2030s. Reuters cited four US officials as saying Australia was expected to buy up to five US Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines in the 2030s – although this would appear to clash with congressional concerns about Australia leapfrogging US needs on its own crowded production line. The Australian government – determined not to leak the details of what it calls its “optimal pathway” to obtain at least eight nuclear-powered submarines – has refused to confirm any of the details ahead of the announcement. But Mead, who leads a taskforce of more than 350 officials from its Canberra office site, appears keen to scotch the idea of outright winners and losers from a process that has been under way for the past year and a half. He maintains it is not a “binary” choice between US or UK options. “I think the three leaders – when you see the announcement – will be very satisfied that we have been able to bring together something that is trilateral,” Mead said. Making waves When the Aukus security partnership was first unveiled in September 2021, it came as a bolt from the blue and triggered significant diplomatic reverberations – both with Australia’s friends and foes. The abrupt scrapping of Australia’s $90bn plan for French designed conventional submarines sparked an immediate rift with Paris – and was the impetus for Emmanuel Macron’s infamous complaint that “I don’t think, I know” that the then-prime minister Scott Morrison lied to him (a claim Morrison always denied). Regional partners Indonesia and Malaysia also expressed fears Aukus could fuel an arms race. China sought to discredit the deal, labelling it an “Anglo-Saxon clique” that would unsettle the region. In February 2022, weeks before the invasion of Ukraine, Russia joined with China in claiming the Aukus deal posed “serious risks of nuclear proliferation”. Despite criticising the then Coalition government’s handling of the diplomacy surrounding Aukus, Labor has stood by the overall policy, and now that it is in government has overseen the final stages of the planning. Mead has been at the centre of that planning. He agreed to an interview with the Guardian in the days leading up to the big announcement, in part to explain the motivations for the submarine plan, and to reassure regional partners about Australia’s commitment to nuclear safety. He says the Indo-Pacific region has become more complex, more fragile and less stable over the past five years, and this has driven the change of approach. Mead made no criticism of Australia’s existing six Collins class submarines, describing these as the most advanced conventional submarines in the world and saying they play an important role in deterrence. “But going forward, there was a realisation that we did need an advanced capability,” said Mead, who prior to his current appointment oversaw the sensitive review that led to the Coalition’s decision to scrap the French contract. ‘Apex predator’ “Nuclear-powered submarines enable you to remain undetected, you can patrol around the homeland, you can deploy further afield. They have great speed and stealth and firepower,” Mead said. “Their primary role is to defend Australia, protect our people, safeguard our economic prosperity. I would say investing in this capability is future-proofing the way of life of Australia.” Mead says the submarines aim “to deter anyone seeking to do harm to Australia” given that the country is heavily reliant on international trade and underwater telecommunications. “Nuclear-powered submarines place really the single greatest question mark in an adversary’s mind,” Mead said. “If deterrence fails, they can respond with massive firepower.” The Nine newspapers, in a deeply reported feature about the Aukus deal published in the lead-up to the 2022 election, said the “transformational power of nuclear-propelled subs is that they could allow Australia to pose a direct threat to the Chinese mainland”. When this line was put to him, Mead did not directly comment on it. But he added that nuclear-powered submarines were “called the apex predator of the oceans”. “They’re the most formidable defence capability one can procure,” Mead said. Transparent oceans? In addition to concerns about how long it might take for Australia to begin operating nuclear-powered submarines – the late 2030s or early 2040s have frequently been at the centre of speculation – other potential issues have been aired publicly. The Australian National University’s National Security College report Transparent Oceans? found that scientific and technological advancements could make it increasingly difficult to hide the presence of submarines. The report suggested that oceans were “likely” or “very likely” to become transparent by the 2050s. Mead said this issue had been taken into account. “We have done a lot of work with our own science organisations, but with our partners as well in looking at what are the vulnerabilities of submarines.” One option is that a submarine serves as a “mothership” from which other uncrewed underwater technology could be dispatched. “I clearly see a role for uncrewed underwater vehicles operating in the 2050s, probably the 2040s, too,” Mead said. “Those uncrewed underwater vehicles could be operated from the nuclear-powered submarine and could be dispatched at multiple chokepoints and working in conjunction with the nuclear-powered submarine.” Safety concerns Mead also wants to assure Australia’s friends across the region – and the population at home – that nuclear safety will be the “paramount” consideration as the three governments put the plan into practice. “We’re going to leverage off the incredible safety record of our US and UK partners,” he said. “They have managed over 500 nuclear reactors over the past 60 years, their submarines have travelled 240m kilometres without a nuclear reactor safety incident – that’s 300 times to the moon and back. “We in Australia have hosted about 280 visits by nuclear-powered warships and submarines.” Mead said the Aukus project depends on “establishing an ecosystem – that we can build a workforce that is aware, confident, and in some aspects, experts in nuclear technology”. “It’s developing navy crews, it’s developing a management system that always has safety at the foremost of its considerations.” Australia also needs to show it can be trusted to protect US military technology. The US has only once before shared its naval nuclear propulsion tech, with the UK in the late 1950s. Mead confirms the recent designation of the Osborne shipyard in South Australia as a critical infrastructure asset – first revealed by Guardian Australia – is part of a broader effort to assure Australia’s Aukus partners that their secrets will be protected. He says part of the Osborne shipyard will be a licensed nuclear facility. “It will have the crown jewels of US and UK technology. So we will really have to put in very high standards of security.” Frenzy of activity Mead said there had been a lot of site visits from US and UK officials to shipyards in South Australia and Western Australia, while Australian officials have also conducted site visits in the US and the UK. “What we’re beginning to put together now is what is the best trilateral way that we deliver the submarine,” he said. The leaders’ announcement next week won’t mark the end of Mead’s taskforce’s work. It will switch focus to actually delivering the project and ensuring the governance arrangements to make it a success. “Whilst the announcement next week will not be a shock for us, our job now is to get on and to deliver this program,” Mead said."

Hillsong claims | Andrew Wilkie has used parliamentary privilege to accuse the mega-church Hillsong of money laundering and tax evasion which he says is proved by leaked documents. Wilkie claimed the church had used “private jets like Ubers” and lavished money on luxury watches, luggage sets and holidays. But the church has disputed many of the accusations as false or out of context.

                    "headline": "Russia-Ukraine war: Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant reconnected to energy grid as UN warns ‘one day our luck will run out’ – as it happened",
                    "bodyText": "The UN gave an urgent warning regarding Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant being disconnected. Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the site’s safety and security. Russian missile strikes across Ukraine while people slept on Thursday killed at least six civilians, knocking out electricity and forcing a nuclear power plant off the grid. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Transnistria’s security forces claim Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans. AFP reports Lithuania’s military intelligence service on Thursday said it estimated that Russia had enough resources to wage two more years of war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has reportedly been snubbed by the Oscars for the second year in a row. Reuters reports that Ukraine will take part in the European Union scheme to jointly buy gas in global markets, to procure 2 billion cubic metres of the fuel ahead of next winter, the EU energy policy chief said on Thursday. A close ally of Alexei Navalny has resigned his post at the opposition leader’s Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF) after it was revealed that he had signed letters calling for the EU to drop sanctions against several UK-based Russian billionaire oligarchs. Leonid Volkov confirmed he had signed and sent a 2022 letter to Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, in which he called for Brussels to relax sanctions on Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and business partners German Khan and Alexei Kuzmichev, in a scandal marked by infighting among Russia’s contentious liberal and opposition circles. “This letter was a big political mistake,” wrote Volkov in a post on Thursday where he uploaded the October 2022 letter to Borrell. “Worse, by doing this, I exceeded my authority – I signed it not in my personal capacity, but on behalf of the organisation. I did not inform my colleagues, and, therefore, I also put them [on the letter].” Volkov said he would resign from ACF International’s board and “take a break from my public socio-political activity”. The organisation had earlier published a list of 6,000 “bribetakers and warmongers” it said should be issued with sanctions by western countries. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog has expressed concern over the recent power outage at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. On Thursday, power to the Russian-occupied plant was lost during Russian air strikes. During a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of directors held in Vienna, Rafael Grossi criticised the organisation’s complacency in preventing such incidents from happening, noting that its primary role was to ensure nuclear safety. ‘What are we doing to prevent this happening? We are the IAEA, we are meant to care about nuclear safety,’ Grossi told its board of directors in a meeting on Thursday in Vienna. ‘Each time we are rolling a dice,’ he said. You can watch the video here: The German chancellor has said that Putin has shown no willingness to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. Speaking to a group of German reporters, Scholz said: “Unfortunately, I see no willingness at the moment,” Scholz was quoted by NBR as saying, adding Ukraine must decide what conditions it is ready to accept for peace. Scholz said that energy supply in Europe’s biggest economy would be sufficient next winter and that the German economy was heading for growth rates last seen in the 1950s and 1960s due to heavy investment in climate protection. Reuters has reported that Russia has introduced personal sanctions against 144 government officials, journalists, lawmakers and other public figures from the three Baltic states who are deemed “most hostile” to Moscow. Reuters reports: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - ruled from Moscow during the Cold War but now members of the European Union and NATO - have been among the strongest critics of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The ministry said the move was a response to what it called active lobbying by the three Baltic republics for more sanctions against Russia and to their “interference in our internal affairs, inciting Russophobic sentiments”. Last year, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania began restricting the entry of Russian citizens travelling from Russia and Belarus in response to what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. AFP reports Lithuania’s military intelligence service on Thursday said it estimated that Russia had enough resources to wage two more years of war in Ukraine. You can read the full report below: “Russia had been accumulating weapons and equipment over the long years of the Cold War,” military intelligence chief Elegijus Paulavicius told reporters. “We estimate that (its) resources would last for another two years of a war of the same intensity as today,” he added. He noted that the assessment depended on the perspective that no foreign country would provide military aid to Moscow. Russia has a large amount of weaponry stored in its reserves, which would allow them to “cause enormous damage and increase the costs of restoration,” he said. He spoke alongside his counterpart from civilian intelligence at a presentation of their annual report. Beyond estimates of Russian resources, the report also suggested that Russia’s mobilisation last year showed that support for the war in Ukraine “is not as big as the regime’s propaganda tried to make it seem”. “Dissatisfaction with the regime’s policies is currently taking a passive form: mostly avoiding mobilisation, complaining about poor provision and disarray in the army,” the document said. It also raised the possibility that Russia’s failures on the battlefield, further mobilisation and a sudden deterioration of the economic situation “would have negative consequences for the stability of the regime”. Lithuania, a member of both the European Union and NATO, has been a major backer of Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February last year. Serhii Andrushko, a Ukrainian reporter, has said that his country’s struggle for freedom also includes another kind of war - against high-level corruption - which experts think could have more success now as Kyiv strives for European Union membership. Reuters reports: Last month, the Radio Liberty correspondent confronted candidates on camera vying to become Kyiv’s next top anti-corruption official about their personal finances and political ties. That might seem less urgent when soldiers are dying every day, but part of Ukraine’s battle includes shedding any perceived similarities to Russia. “Particularly its attitude to corruption,” Andrushko said. According to Transparency International’s 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index, Ukraine ranked slightly better than Russia but still well below the global average. So reporters like Andrushko say they are working to keep their rulers honest, a job some experts and media insiders said could have more impact now that Kyiv is under pressure to prove it can clean up its act as it seeks membership in the European Union. They said a major political shake-up seen earlier this year, when more than a dozen officials were dismissed amid a flurry of critical domestic press coverage, could be a taste of things to come if Ukraine’s investigative journalists continue. Their focus also shows civil society is embracing its role as a government watchdog even as the war grinds on. “Media are becoming more influential because they’re appealing to the more acute sense of justice among citizens,” said researcher Petro Burkovskyy, of the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation think-tank. They will need to choose stories wisely and back up their reporting, he added, since being sloppy or overly critical can invite public scepticism or even accusations of being unpatriotic. Many journalists are also turning their attention to uncovering Russian war crimes and assets in Ukraine. Here is some more detailed reporting on Ukraine’s national grid being reconnected to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station today. Reuters reports: Back-up diesel generators - a last line of defence to prevent meltdown from overheating reactor fuel - kicked in after external power was lost to the plant early on Thursday, but they have only enough fuel to power it for 10 days. Ukraine blamed Russia for the loss of power to the plant in southeastern Ukraine. Officials in the part of the Zaporizhzhia region which is occupied by Russia called it a “provocation” by Kyiv. The incident renewed fears of an accident at Europe’s largest atomic power station, nearly four decades after the Chornobyl nuclear disaster, but national grid operator Ukrenergo signalled that repairs had been carried out quickly. “Specialists of ‘Ukrenergo’ have restored the power supply of the Zaporizhzhia NPP (nuclear power plant), which was interrupted by today’s missile strikes,” it said in a statement. “The ZNPP is switching from diesel generators to receiving electricity for its own needs from the unified energy system of Ukraine.” Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of compromising safety by shelling the site of the plant, forcing power cuts during air strikes and flouting safety measures. Russia has denied shelling the site, and has accused Ukraine of being behind the shelling. “The risks of disaster at the Zaporizhzhia NPP are significantly increasing, and our ability to react to them, to avoid them are significantly decreasing,” Oleh Korikov, acting chairman of the Ukrainian state nuclear safety watchdog, told a news briefing on Thursday. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, also expressed alarm after confirming the back-up generators had kicked in. Calling for a protection zone around the plant, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told the watchdog’s Board of Governors: “Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out.” IAEA monitors are currently on site and Grossi has been pressing both sides to establish a demilitarised “safe zone” around the station. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has reportedly been snubbed by the Oscars for the second year in a row. According to Variety, Zelenskiy had been hoping to appear on this Sunday’s telecast following on from previous cultural appearances but the request has been denied. In the past year, the comedian turned politician has appeared via satellite during the Grammy awards and Golden Globes and within film festivals such as Cannes and most recently Berlin. Last month marked the one year anniversary of Russia invading Ukraine. Zelenskiy had secured Mike Simpson, a top power agent at major agency WME, after his client Aaron Kaufman co-directed Ukraine documentary Superpower made with Sean Penn, who loaned one of his two Oscars to Zelenskiy last year. The actor called it “a symbolic silly thing” but after Ukraine wins the war against Russia, he could bring it back to him. He had previously promised to smelt an Oscar if the Academy didn’t let him speak. “There is nothing greater that the Academy Awards could do than to give [Zelensky] an opportunity to talk to all of us,” he said. Reuters reports that Ukraine will take part in the European Union scheme to jointly buy gas in global markets, to procure 2 billion cubic metres of the fuel ahead of next winter, the EU energy policy chief said on Thursday. EU countries plan to pool demand and sign their first joint gas contracts in the coming months, to help fill storage caverns ahead of peak winter demand as Europe replaces Russian gas. “Ukraine has indicated that on top of their own domestic production, they might need, for a secure winter, another 2 billion cubic metres,” EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson told a news conference on Thursday. European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic, who leads the EU’s joint gas-buying, held a video call with international gas suppliers on Wednesday. Sefcovic said Europe was on track to expand its capacity to regasify liquefied natural gas to 227 billion cubic metres by 2024, up from 178 bcm now, as countries swap Russian gas for other supplies. Participating in the EU scheme could help Ukraine to stave off gas shortages. Of the 27.3 bcm of gas Ukraine used in 2021, domestic production accounted for about 19.8 bcm, imports were 2.6 bcm and 4.9 bcm of gas was taken from underground storage. Initial estimates from state-owned energy firm Naftogaz suggest Ukrainian gas production was around 18 bcm in 2022. Ukraine uses little gas to produce electricity, but relies on the fuel for heating and industry - sectors vulnerable should Russian strikes damage infrastructure. Ukraine does not import gas directly from Russia, but Ukrainian pipelines still carry some Russian gas to Europe. Russia has bombarded Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in recent months, and on Thursday launched missile strikes across Ukraine, killing at least six civilians and forcing a nuclear power plant off the grid. Kadri Simson said she would convene an emergency video call with Ukraine and EU energy ministers on Thursday to discuss the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, after Kyiv said Russian attacks had severed the plant from the power grid and forced it onto emergency diesel power. Russian strikes hit targets across a sleeping Ukraine early on Thursday. The capital, Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city, Kharkiv, were some of the places struck by a barrage of missiles, knocking out power to several areas. Four people have died in Russian missile strikes on the western region of Lviv and the strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said on Thursday that the European Union is completely ignoring any talks on the need to carry out an investigation of the Nord Stream gas pipeline blasts, Reuters reports. Russia has repeatedly asked to be allowed to join the investigations into the blasts, which ruptured three of the four pipelines of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas links that connect Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. Earlier today the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described it as “incomprehensible” that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that the south command of the Ukrainian armed forces has claimed to have destroyed a Russian self-propelled artillery installation on the Kinburn spit. The claim has not been independently verified. The Kinburn spit is a stretch of land that stretches out from Kherson oblast to the west, and is opposite the southern coast of Ukraine that runs from Odesa to Mykolaiv. It is currently occupied by Russian forces. Kherson is one of the regions of Ukraine that Russia partially occupies and claims to have annexed. Petr Pavel, a former Czech army chief and high-level Nato official, took the oath of office to start his five-year term as Czech president on Thursday. Pavel beat populist former prime minister Andrej Babiš in a January election on pledges to firmly anchor the central European country in the European Union and Nato, a turn away from the policy of predecessor Miloš Zeman, who had tried to boost relations with Russia and China. Pavel, a social liberal who campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the centre-right government, has tried to convey a message of unity after the divisive Zeman, who retired after 10 years in office on Wednesday. Reuters reports Czech presidents do not have many day-to-day duties, but they pick prime ministers and central bank heads, have a say in foreign policy, are powerful opinion makers, and can push the government on policies. Pavel has fully supported continued aid for Ukraine in its defence against Russia’s invasion. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southeastern Ukraine was reconnected to Ukraine’s energy grid on Thursday, Ukrainian grid operator Ukrenergo said. Reuters reports that the Ukrainian state nuclear energy company Energoatom had said earlier on Thursday that power to the Russian-occupied plant was lost during Russian air strikes. Speaking to the BBC, the Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun said she believed that Russia’s latest assault on the country was an attempt to make citizens feel as though the country was “not safe” to continue living in. Sovsun added that she thought the primary purpose of the attacks was to “make sure everybody feels scared” after a period of relative safety in the country’s capital, Kyiv. Reuters reports that local security services in the Moscow-backed breakaway Transnistria region of Moldova said on they had thwarted a Ukrainian assassination attempt against the region’s leader, according to Russian state news agencies reported. Reuters reports: Kyiv rejected the claims as a Kremlin “provocation”, the latest in a series of allegations, claims and counterclaims over escalating tensions in the territory, wedged along Ukraine’s south-western border with Moldova. It was not immediately clear whether the Transnistrian officials had provided evidence to support their claim. “The ministry of state security informs about the prevention of a terrorist attack. On the instructions of the Security Service of Ukraine, a crime was being prepared against a number of officials. The suspects have been detained,” the Russian state-run Tass news agency quoted the ministry as saying. In response, the Security Service of Ukraine said in a statement that the accusation “should be considered exclusively as a provocation orchestrated by the Kremlin”. It added: “Lies and provocations are the weapons (Russia) actively uses. But today the entire world sees the true face of the aggressor country and does not believe the statements of Russia or its satellites.” Transnistria, a mainly Russian-speaking territory which borders Ukraine, broke from Moldova’s control in 1990, a year before the collapse of the Soviet Union, and is dependent on Russian support. Its allegiance to Moscow and location on Ukraine’s western border have been a constant cause of concern since Russia invaded that the war could spread to the region. Last month, Russia accused Ukraine of planning to invade Transnistria after staging a ‘false flag’ operation there, a claim Kyiv denied. Moldova also rejected Russia’s claim. Moscow also said it would view as an attack on itself any actions that threatened Russian peacekeepers stationed in Transnistria. In a statement this morning about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the site’s safety and security. He said: “This is the sixth time – let me say it again sixth time, that ZNPP has lost all off-site power and has had to operate in this emergency mode. Let me remind you - this is the largest nuclear power station in Europe.” He added: “What are we doing? How can we sit here in this room this morning and allow this to happen? This cannot go on. I am astonished by the complacency. What are we doing to prevent this from happening? Each time we are rolling a dice, and if we allow this to continue then one day our luck will run out”. You can read an explainer regarding the significance of the power plant here: The South Korean company Hyundai Motor Co is in talks with a Kazakhstan company over the sale of its manufacturing plant in Russia, it has been reported. Reuters reports: Many factories in Russia have suspended production and furloughed workers due to shortages of hi-tech equipment because of sanctions and an exodus of western manufacturers since Moscow invaded Ukraine last year. The local government in St Petersburg has been negotiating with Kazakhstan to sell Hyundai’s Russia plant, Yonhap news agency reported, citing a Tass report. Yonhap reported that negotiations to sell Hyundai’s plant in St Petersburg to an auto-related company in Astana, Kazakhstan, are in the final stage, citing an unnamed source. The deal could be signed as early as June, it said. Hyundai suspended operations at its Russian factory last March. Hyundai was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters. Intense fighting has continued in and around the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. The below graphic shows the Russian military advances within the region. A residential building in Lviv oblast has been targeted by Russian missiles. Maksym Kozytskyy, the head of the Lviv oblast administration, released drone footage showing the aftermath of the attack on Thursday. A fifth person had died in overnight strikes, the governor said. Reuters has reported more details on the Russian missile strikes across Ukraine while people slept on Thursday, killing at least six civilians, knocking out electricity and forcing a nuclear power plant off the grid. Reuters reports: The first big volley of missile strikes since mid-February shattered the longest period of comparative calm since Moscow began a campaign to attack Ukraine’s civil infrastructure five months ago. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions had been hit. “The occupiers can only terrorise civilians. That’s all they can do. But it won’t help them. They won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done,” Zelenskiy said in a statement. At least five people were killed in a missile that destroyed a village house in the western Lviv region, according to emergency services. Drone footage from the area, some 700 km (440 miles) from any military battlefield, showed a flattened home surrounded by badly damaged buildings. Another civilian was reported killed by the missiles in the central Dnipro region. Three civilians were separately reported killed by artillery in Kherson. In the capital Kyiv, residents were awakened by explosions. A seven-hour air strike alert through the night was the longest of the Russian air campaign that began in October. “I heard a very loud explosion, very loud. We quickly jumped out of bed and saw one car on fire. Then the other cars caught on fire as well. The glass shattered on the balconies and windows,” said Liudmyla, 58, holding a toddler in her arms. “It’s very frightening. Very frightening. The child got scared and jumped out of bed,” she said. “How can they do this? How is this possible? They are not humans, I don’t know what to call them. They are frightening the children, their mental state will be disrupted.” Moscow says its campaign of targeting Ukraine’s infrastructure far from the front is intended to reduce its ability to fight. Kyiv says the air strikes have no military purpose and aim to harm and intimidate civilians, a war crime. Ukrainian officials said Moscow had fired six of its kinzhal hypersonic missiles, an unprecedented number, which Ukraine has no way of shooting down. Russia is believed to have only a few dozen of the missiles, which President Vladimir Putin regularly touts in speeches as a weapon for which NATO has no answer. Ukraine said the missiles had knocked out the power supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, severing it from the Ukrainian grid. The plant, which Russia has held since capturing it early in the war, is near the front line and both sides have warned in the past of a potential for disaster there caused by fighting. Moscow said the was being kept safe on diesel backup power. “Everything is absolutely normal: the specialists at the plant are working quite professionally, the automation has started up,” Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the CEO of Russian state energy firm Rosenergoatom, said on state TV channel Rossiya 24. “There is no threat or danger of a nuclear incident. There is more than enough fuel and, if necessary, it will be supplied to the plant.” Alessio Mamo has been at the scene of today’s strike on Kyiv for the Guardian. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it had been “a difficult night” as Russian strikes hit targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions were reported in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, reported five people had been killed in a strike on the Zolochiv district. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, said two women in their 70s had been injured by a strike on Pisochyn. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, reported that three people were killed in the southern city of Kherson. Strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid, the company Energoatom said. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for ten days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. It took two weeks for power to be restored. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has described the overnight strikes as without military purpose and “just Russian barbarism”. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday, during a press conference with his Saudi counterpart, that Saudi Arabia was among the countries that had facilitated prisoner of war swaps with Ukraine. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Transnistria’s security forces claim Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans. The Kremlin said on Thursday it doubted the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines could have been carried out without state support, after the New York Times reported that a pro-Ukrainian non-government group might have been responsible for the blasts. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was vital to identify who was behind the attacks which ruptured the multi-billion dollar pipelines last September. He added that it was incomprehensible that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. Ukraine will take part in European Union countries’ scheme to jointly buy gas, the bloc’s energy policy chief said on Thursday. Slovakia needs to make a decision on sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the country’s defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said on Thursday, adding Poland has expressed willingness to act jointly in this matter. In a visit to Kyiv on Wednesday, UN secretary general António Guterres told journalists it was “critical” that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of Ukraine across the Black Sea be renewed. A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal. The Kremlin, however, said on Thursday there were still “a lot of questions” remaining over the deal, and that there were currently no plans for a direct meeting with Guterres. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Tobi Thomas will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Another series of air raid sirens have just sounded across Ukraine, including in Odesa and Kherson in the south, Lviv in the west and Sumy in the north. The air raid alert in Kyiv overnight lasted for seven hours, as a total of 81 missiles were fired at targets across the country by Russia. Reuters reports that the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday, during a press conference with his Saudi counterpart, that Saudi Arabia and other countries had facilitated prisoner of war swaps with Ukraine. The Kremlin said on Thursday it doubted the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines could have been carried out without state support, after the New York Times reported that a pro-Ukrainian non-government group might have been responsible for the blasts. Reuters reports Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was vital to identify who was behind the attacks which ruptured the multibillion-dollar pipelines last September. He added it was incomprehensible that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. German prosecutors confirmed yesterday that investigators had searched a boat that may have been used in the bombings. Earlier today our First Edition newsletter carried some analysis of the situation, with Archie Bland speaking to our defence editor, Dan Sabbagh. Here is what they had to say about the range of people who might be considered responsible for the attack: While the consequences for European energy supplies have not ultimately proven severe, there are wider implications, Sabbagh said. “Technically this is an attack in international waters, but it’s within the Nato sphere. It’s infrastructure well beyond Russia and Ukraine, so it triggered a lot of anxiety about the security of other assets. It makes the war uncomfortably close.” If any country with a stake in the region were proven responsible, that would have significant consequences of its own. If the US or a Nato or EU country was behind the attack, that would cause a serious rift in the western alliance in support of Ukraine. If Ukraine did it, fears that Kyiv was acting recklessly would probably diminish their support in Europe and the US – particularly, for obvious reasons, in Germany. And evidence of Moscow’s culpability “would be a new frontier in Russian aggression,” Sabbagh said. While a Russian act of sabotage on a Russian-owned piece of infrastructure would not clearly amount to an act of war, the material damage to future gas supplies “would further unite the west against Putin”. You can read more of that analysis here: The mystery of the Nord Stream sabotage – and who may be responsible Ukraine will take part in European Union countries’ scheme to jointly buy gas, the bloc’s energy policy chief said on Thursday. “We have integrated Ukraine in the gas joint purchasing platform with a view to help secure 2bn cubic metres of additional gas,” Reuters reports the EU energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, told a meeting of EU lawmakers. EU countries plan to sign their first contracts to jointly buy gas by this summer. The Kremlin said on Thursday that there were still “a lot of questions” remaining over the Black Sea grain deal, and that there were currently no plans for a meeting with the UN secretary general, António Guterres. The deal, which allows grain to be safely exported from Ukrainian ports despite a Russian naval blockade, expires on 18 March, but cannot be extended if Russia objects. Moscow has already signalled it is unhappy with aspects of the deal, as it seeks to expand the markets for its own agricultural products. Ukraine has said it will seek to extend the deal for at least a year, and wishes the port of Mykolaiv to be included. Kyiv said Russian shelling killed three people on Thursday in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, as Moscow unleashed a wave of missile strikes overnight. “Russian terrorists shelled Kherson in the morning. They hit … a public transport stop. Three people died as a result of the shelling,” AFP reports Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said on social media. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. In its report Tass writes: Assassination attempts on a number of officials of Transnistria were prepared on the instructions of the Ukrainian security service (SBU), the ministry of state security of the republic reported. Suspects of preparing an assassination attempt on the leader of Transnistria were detained and are giving confessions. The impending assassination attempt on the leader of Transnistria is qualified as a preparation for a terrorist attack. The prosecutor of Transnistria said that the SBU was preparing a terrorist attack using a car bomb in the center of Tiraspol. The claims have not been independently verified. Transnistria, which attempted to break away from Moldova in the early 1990s, borders Ukraine’s west and has Russian troops stationed there. Slovakia needs to make a decision on sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the country’s defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said on Thursday, adding Poland has expressed willingness to act jointly in this matter. “I think it is time to make a decision,” Reuters reports Nad said on Facebook. “People are dying in Ukraine, we can really help them, there is no room for Slovak politicking.” The governor of Lviv region, Maksym Kozytskyi, has given further details of the strike that has killed five people. In a message on Telegram he posted to say: Today, around 4 o’clock in the morning, an enemy missile fell in the Zolochiv district during an air raid. Three men and two women who were at home at that moment died. The fire destroyed three residential buildings, three cars, a garage and several outbuildings. The fire was extinguished. The demolition of the destroyed buildings has already been completed. 28 rescuers, five units of special equipment and a canine team were involved in the work. Drone footage shows the aftermath of the strike. The regional governor said air defences shot down missiles over Lviv, but “I cannot say exactly how many missiles were destroyed over our region, the relevant services have asked not to make this information public” and he urged the public not to release details. Kozytskyi went on to say: As usual, during the day, internally displaced people arrived in our region by evacuation trains, and people also left by train to Przemyśl [in Poland]. In the districts of Lviv oblast, humanitarian aid was collected and handed over to soldiers on the frontlines and to residents of frontline settlements, cars were sent to the defenders. Our foreign partners transferred aid to the communities of the region. Everyone lived yesterday, doing good deeds and getting closer to victory in their place. But we woke up to sirens, and news about the dead. We will never forget this day. We will never forgive. And we will direct all our efforts to revenge and the return of justice. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has described the overnight strikes on Ukraine as without military purpose and “just Russian barbarism”. In a tweet he said: Russia launched a massive missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight, leading to loss of lives and damaging civilian infrastructure. No military objective, just Russian barbarism. The day will come when Putin and his associates are held accountable by a special tribunal. Reuters reports that Nato member Denmark has confirmed that Troels Lund Poulsen will continue to act as acting defence minister in the absence of Jakob Ellemann-Jensen. Ellemann-Jensen, 49, was briefly admitted to hospital in February after making a trip to Ukraine and has been on an indefinite period of sick leave. At the time he said in a Facebook message: “I have been unusually busy for a long time. Now my body is sending me a signal that it’s time to take a break, if not it’s going to end badly.” Here are some more of the images to come out of Kyiv today. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted to his official Telegram about the night’s events, writing: It’s been a difficult night. A massive rocket attack across the country. Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipro, Odesa, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia regions. Attacks on critical infrastructure and residential buildings. Unfortunately, there are injured and dead. My condolences to the families. All services are working. The energy system is being restored. Restrictions were imposed in all regions. The enemy fired 81 missiles in an attempt to intimidate Ukrainians again, returning to their miserable tactics. The occupiers can only terrorise civilians. That’s all they can do. But it won’t help them. They won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done. We thank the guardians of our skies and everyone who helps to overcome the consequences of the occupiers’ sneaking attacks. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, has posted this summary to Telegram of the latest news to emerge from the overnight strikes. It reports: In Kyiv, the alarm lasted for about seven hours. Two people were hospitalised due to falling rocket fragments. Five people were killed in the Zolochiv district of the Lviv region due to a rocket hitting a residential area, one person was killed and two were injured in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Energy infrastructure and industrial enterprises were also damaged in the region. About 15 strikes were made in Kharkiv and the region, two people were injured. Critical infrastructure was targeted. Metro and electric transport are not working. In Kirovohrad oblast, Odesa oblast and Zhytomyr oblast, energy infrastructure facilities were hit. Also, according to preliminary information, there are hits in Vinnytsia. At night, electricity restrictions were applied preventively in all regions to reduce risks to the system. Emergency power outages were used in regions where infrastructure was damaged. Kharkiv region and Zhytomyr region are partially de-energized. Kharkiv is completely without electricity. The claims have not been independently verified. Here are some more images from the scene of the strike in Kyiv. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has announced that a fifth person has been killed in overnight strikes. He posted to Telegram to say: The number of people killed as a result of the fall of the rocket in the Zolochiv district has increased to five. The body of another man, born in 1963, was discovered under the rubble. Sincere condolences to the relatives. Ukraine’s air force has issued a statement via Telegram on the wave of attacks from Russia overnight. In it, it claims that “the defence forces of Ukraine destroyed 34 cruise missiles … as well as 4 ‘Shahed-136/131’ unmanned aerial vehicles”. It claims that a total of 48 Kalibr-type cruise missiles had been fired by Russia. It described the attack as featuring “81 missiles of various types” in total, and that “the launches were carried out from 10 Tu-95 strategic aircraft, seven Tu-22M3 long-range aircraft, eight Su-35 fighters, six MiG-31K aircraft and three Kalibr KR carriers in the Black Sea”. It adds: “As a result of organised countermeasures, 8 Kh-31P and Kh-59 guided air missiles did not reach their targets. It is worth noting that the armed forces of Ukraine do not have means capable of destroying Kh-22 and Kh-47 ‘Kinzhal’ and S-300.” The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that energy company DTEK has reinstated power in Dnipropetrovsk. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has provided this update via Telegram on the situation overnight in his region. He wrote: The enemy launched a massive rocket attack on Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region. At least 15 arrivals of S-300 missiles were recorded. Critical infrastructure objects are hit. In addition, a civil infrastructure object was damaged in the city of Kharkiv. Synyehubov said two women in their 70s were injured in Pisochyn, with one of them hospitalised, and that an agricultural facility was damaged in Slobozhanske. He added that during the previous day, multiple settlements had been shelled with the result that “houses and commercial buildings were damaged, fires broke out”. Here are some of the latest images we have received over the news wires of the aftermath of strikes on Kyiv overnight. That’s goodbye from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. I’ll be handing over to my colleague Martin Belam shortly. Here is what happened overnight, as Russia launched mass strikes across a sleeping Ukraine: Russian strikes hit targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including the capital Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets, including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Four people have died in Russian missile strikes on the western region of Lviv, the head of the regional military administration said on Telegram. “At this moment, it is known about four dead. These are four adults. Two men and two women. They were at home when the rocket fell. The debris is still being sorted out. There may be other people under them,” said Maksym Kozytskyi. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said explosions were reported in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. Strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid, the company Energoatom said. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for 10 days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Then, it took two weeks for power to be restored to the plant. Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he won’t meet with Vladimir Putin until Russia leaves Ukraine. Ukraine’s president appeared on CNN on Wednesday night in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet Putin, Zelenskiy said: “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word” and “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that.” Four people have died in Russian missile strikes on the western region of Lviv, the head of the regional military administration said on Telegram. “Residents of Lviv oblast, an air alert lasted for four hours this night … In Zolochiv district, an enemy rocket fell in a residential area. A fire started. It has already been extinguished,” said Maksym Kozytskyi. “At this moment, it is known about four dead. These are four adults. Two men and two women. They were at home when the rocket fell. The debris is still being sorted out. There may be other people under them.” Three residential buildings were destroyed. Kozytskyi posted a video of the damage: More now on Zaporizhzhia. The statement from state energy company Energoatom says: On the night of 9 March, the enemy delivered another barbaric massive attack on the energy infrastructure of Ukraine. “As a result of shelling, the last line that fed the ZNPP was damaged. Now the station works on diesel generators. The Russians are putting the world on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe. And this is the day after the negotiations with the UN on the demilitarization of the ZNPP,” said Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko. Also, as of 6,30am on 9 March, shelling of energy facilities was recorded in the Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, and Zhytomyr regions. Here is our wrap of the attacks overnight: Volleys of Russian missiles struck targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second city of Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said on Telegram that a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, cutting power. Residential areas were also hit, but no casualties were immediately reported. Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Synehubov said the city and region had been hit by 15 strikes, with targets including infrastructure. Other strikes were reported in the central city of Dnipro and regions throughout the country. Kyiv mayor Vitalii Klitschko has just confirmed that one of the explosions was an attack on a power facility, and that 40% of Kyiv’s residents are now without heating. It is currently 4C. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. It is currently 8am in Kyiv. Here is a summary of what has happened overnight: Russian strikes hit a series of Ukrainian regions early on Thursday, including the capital Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets, including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said explosions were registered in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. Power supply has been cut pre-emptively to about 15% of Kyiv residents, he said. The strikes cut Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant off from the power grid, the company Energoatom announced on Thursday morning. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for 10 days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s National Grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Then, it took two weeks for power to be restored to the plant. Zelenskiy said he won’t meet with Putin until Russia leaves Ukraine. Ukraine’s president appeared on CNN on Wednesday night in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet with Putin, Zelenskiy said, “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word” and “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that”. Here is a photo from Svyatoshyn in Kyiv, where missile strikes set cars alight: Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been off from the Ukrainian power grid, the power company Energoatom announced this morning. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for 10 days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Then, it took two weeks for power to be restored to the plant. Missile strikes in Zhytomyr have left people in the city without water, according to the mayor. Air sirens are sounding in Mykolaiv, the governor, Vitalii Kim, has just said on Telegram. Electricity supply has been cut for 15% of people in Kyiv, the mayor, Vitalii Klychko, said. Kyiv mayor Vitalii Klychko has confirmed that there has been another explosion in the city, this time in Svyatoshyn district. He said that there were two people injured. “Another explosion in the capital. Svyatoshyn district. All services go to the place. Cars are burning in the yard of one of the residential buildings. The air alert continues. Stay in shelters! Two injured in Sviatoshyn district. Medics provide assistance on the spot.” The CEO of Ukrainian power company Yasno, Serhii Kovalenko, has said that emergency power cuts have been put in place due to the mass strikes. “Morning. Emergency blackouts are used due to the enemy attack. This is a preventive step, as you all remember,” he said. It is currently 7.20 am in Kyiv. The Kyiv Independent reports that, according to one of its journalists, another loud explosion was heard in Kyiv a few minutes ago. “This is nowhere near over,” The British Ambassador to Ukraine has just said on Twitter. Maxim Tucker of the Times has posted a video of what he says is smoke rising from Kyiv thermo-electric power station this morning: New Voice of Ukraine journalist Euan MacDonald said that the Kyiv explosion was “near Troyeshyna on left bank of Dnipro (there’s a heat-power plant nearby). Must have been a big bang if I heard it 10km?” Kyiv’s mayor has reported that Russia has struck Kyiv during its latest mass strikes accoss Ukraine. “Explosions in the Holosiiv district of the capital. All services follow in place. More details later,” Kyiv’s Mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram a few minutes ago. Reporters in Kyiv said they heard a loud explosion at around 6am. The explosions are part of a pre-dawn wave of mass strikes by Russia launched before dawn on Thursday. Maxim Tucker of the Times posted a video of what he said was smoke rising from a thermo-electric power station in Kyiv: Explosions were also reported in Odesa and Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas. Air raid sirens sounded across the country. Ukrainian newspaper Dzerkalo Tyzhnia is also reporting an explosion in Kyiv, as well as blasts heard in the city of Sumy, and a drone spotted above the western Lviv region. The Kyiv Post is reporting that one of its journalists has heard explosions in the city amid air raid warnings. The Guardian has not verified this independently. Asked by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer whether the US will send Ukraine F-16 fighter jets Zelensky said, “The fighter jets issue is difficult. We’re waiting for this decision to be taken.” “We really need this and really appeal to the president that they could start training Ukrainian pilots, and President Biden told me that it will be worked upon … I believe that the United States will give us the opportunity to defend our skies,” Zelensky said. Zelenskiy invited top US house speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, to visit Ukraine as doubts over support for Kyiv’s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelensky proposed the visit in the interview with CNN. When told of the invitation McCarthy told CNN’s Manu Raju that he does not plan to visit Ukraine, and argued that President Joe Biden has not acted quickly enough to aid the country. McCarthy, a California Republican, has said he supports Ukraine but does not support “a blank check,” a position he repeated on Tuesday – even though there is federal oversight of all the dollars that are spent there. Zelenskiy said that his children are still in Ukraine. “My daughter joined the university and she studies there, and my son is attending school in Ukraine,” he said in his CNN interview. “They’re both in Ukraine. They’re very much like other Ukrainian kids. We live with sirens.” “We want victory. We don’t want to get used to war, but we got used to the challenges. Everyone wants one thing: to end the war,” he said. Zelenskiy appeared on CNN this evening in the US, in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet with Putin, Zelenskiy said, “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word”. “We don’t have any confidence in him,” Zelensky added. “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that”. Here is more detail on what local officials have said. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, triggering power cuts. “As a result of a mass missile strike, an energy infrastructure site was hit in the region as well as residences,” Marchenko said on Telegram. He said anti-aircraft units had downed some missiles and new attacks could follow. “Fortunately, there are no casualties. Electricity restrictions are in effect.” Kharkiv region Governor Oleh Synehubov said the city and region had been hit by about 15 strikes. “The enemy made about 15 strikes on the city and region,” he said on Telegram. “Infrastructure was again among the targets. Information on casualties is being clarified.” Another strike was reported in the central city of Dnipro and in the western towns of Lutsk and Rivne, far from the front lines in the year-old war. Air raid sirens are sounding across the country before dawn this morning. BBC Ukraine correspondent Myroslava Petsa wrote on Twitter, “It’s 3 am in Ukraine. Russia won’t let Ukrainians sleep tight tonight. Lots of drones and rockets fired in all possible directions in Ukraine … This is the terror civilians’ve been living through for more than a year already.” Analysts and Ukrainian leaders had expected mass missile strikes during the week of the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 24 February. The Kyiv Independent reports that explosions have been heard in several cities and regional communities, but we are waiting for confirmation from local officials. The newspaper listed the cities and regions of Kyiv, Poltava, Lviv, Vinnytsia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Kharkiv, Odesa, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk among those where explosions were heard. Russian strikes hit a series of Ukrainian regions early on Thursday, including the Black Sea port of Odesa and Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, Reuters reported, citing regional officials. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said on Telegram that a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, triggering power cuts. Residential areas had also been hit, but no casualties were reported. Kharkiv region governor Oleh Synehubov said the city and region had been hit by 15 strikes, with targets including infrastructure. Other strikes were reported in the central city of Dnipro and regions throughout the country. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest. It’s 5am local time in Kyiv, and we have reports of strikes across Ukraine, including the Black Sea port of Odesa and Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said on Telegram that a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, triggering power cuts. We’ll have more news shortly. In the meantime here are the key recent developments in the war: The city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine’s east, could fall in the next few days, said Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. “What we see is that Russia is throwing more troops, more forces and what Russia lacks in quality they try to make up in quantity. They have suffered big losses, but at the same time, we cannot rule out that Bakhmut may eventually fall in the coming days,” he said. The founder of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, which has been leading the Russian assault on Bakhmut, has said Russian forces now fully control the east of the city. The claims have not been independently verified. The General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in its Wednesday morning report: “The enemy, despite significant losses, continues to storm the town of Bakhmut.” Russia is unlikely to capture significantly more territory this year, according to the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines. She told a Senate hearing that the military will probably be unable to carry on its current level of fighting, even with the possible capture of Bakhmut. The Pentagon has been accused of blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC) about Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The defence department is said to be firmly opposed to using the Hague-based ICC, as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has invited top US house speaker Kevin McCarthy to visit Ukraine as doubts over support for Kyiv’s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelensky proposed the visit in an interview with CNN. Zelensky has also called for “democratic success” in Georgia where thousands of protesters have rallied for a second day, against a controversial “foreign agent” bill, reminiscent of Russian legislation used to silence critics. “There is no Ukrainian who would not wish success to our friendly Georgia. Democratic success. European success,” he said in his evening address to the nation. The US obtained a warrant to seize a Boeing aircraft owned by Russian oil company Rosneft that is valued at over $25m, the Justice Department said. The District Court for the Eastern District of New York authorised the seizure, based on violations of export controls and sanctions against Russia, the Justice Department said. In a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, UN secretary general, António Guterres, told journalists it was “critical” that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of Ukraine across the Black Sea be renewed, with Ukraine traditionally being one of the world’s largest exporters of grain. A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal. European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Wednesday he had suggested the bloc spend €1bn for the joint procurement of ammunition for Ukraine and to refill their own stockpiles. “I propose to mobilise another €1bn,” Reuters reported he told the media after a meeting of EU defence ministers in Stockholm. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg said that it was still uncertain who carried out the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September last year, and that national investigations needed to be allowed to finish. German officials announced that they searched a ship in January that they believe many have been used to transport explosives used in the sabotage. Germany has the lead role in the investigation. Intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022, the New York Times has reported. There was no evidence President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, or his top lieutenants were involved, or that the perpetrators were acting at the direction of any Ukrainian government officials, said the report, citing US officials."

                    "bodyText": "Russia launched six hypersonic missiles able to evade air defences in the early hours of Thursday morning as it unleashed its largest missile barrage against Ukraine in three weeks. Critical infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions had been hit, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. At least six people were killed in a missile strike on a residential area in the western Lviv region, 440 miles (700km) from the frontline, according to emergency services. Three buildings were destroyed by fire after the strike and rescue workers were combing through rubble looking for more possible victims. “The occupiers can only terrorise civilians. That’s all they can do. But it won’t help them. They won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done,” Zelenskiy said in a statement. In the capital, Kyiv, the seven-hour alert through the night was the longest of Russia’s five-month air campaign. Ukrainian officials said Moscow had fired six of its Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, an unprecedented number, which Ukraine has no way of shooting down. Russia is believed to have only a few dozen of the missiles, which the president, Vladimir Putin, regularly touts in speeches as a weapon for which Nato has no answer. For much of Thursday the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s largest – was forced to rely on diesel-powered generators after Ukrainian authorities said missile attacks had damaged power lines. The plant, which Russia has held since capturing it early in the war, is near the frontline and both sides have warned of a potential for nuclear accidents there caused by fighting. The power grid operator Ukrenergo said in the afternoon that the power supply had been restored and the plant was switching away from generators. Russian-installed officials called the temporary cutoff a Ukrainian provocation. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, urged again for a protection zone around the plant. “Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,” he told the International Atomic Energy Agency’s 35-nation board of governors. Ukraine’s air force said the attack comprised, in total, “81 missiles of various types”, launched from Russian aircraft and carriers in the Black Sea. Defence forces destroyed 34 cruise missiles and four drones, it added. “Unfortunately, a missile of the Kinzhal type hit an infrastructure object,” said Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv region’s military administration. The military administration said 40% of people in the capital were without heating on Thursday morning. The city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions were reported in the Holosiivskyi district, and two people were wounded in the Sviatoshynskyi district. Smoke could be seen rising from a facility in Holosiivskyi and police cordoned off all roads leading to it. The governor of Odesa region said a mass missile attack hit an energy facility in the port city, cutting power. Residential areas were also struck. Kharkiv was left without electricity as a result of the overnight attack, according to Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. The regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov, said the city and region had been hit by 15 strikes, with targets including infrastructure. Synyehubov said two women in their 70s were injured in Pisochyn and an agricultural facility was damaged in Slobozhanske. Multiple settlements were shelled on Wednesday, damaging houses and commercial buildings, he added. Other blasts were reported in the central city of Dnipro and regions throughout Ukraine. The Russian defence ministry said the strikes were in response to what Moscow called a terrorist attack in Bryansk region last week, when members of a group called the Russian Volunteer Corps staged an incursion from Ukraine. Russia said two civilians were killed in the incident, which Ukraine accused Moscow of staging as a false “provocation”. The missile barrage came after Ukraine’s military said late on Wednesday it had managed to push back intense Russian attacks on the city of Bakhmut, despite a Russian claim of control over its eastern half. As one of the bloodiest battles of the year-long war ground on in the small city’s ruins, Ukrainian defenders – who last week appeared to be preparing for a tactical retreat – remained defiant. “The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a letup in storming the city of Bakhmut,” the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said on Facebook. “Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.” The battle for Bakhmut, which is still under Kyiv’s control, has raged for seven months, with thousands of people killed and hundreds of buildings collapsed or charred. The few remaining civilians have been confined to basements for months with no running water, electricity or gas. Ukrainian military and political leaders now speak of hanging on to positions and inflicting as many casualties as possible on the Russians to grind down their fighting capability. Despite rumours of an imminent retreat of his troops, Zelenskiy said during an address on Wednesday evening that he had instructed the Ukrainian army to find forces to bolster the defence of the city. “I told the chief of staff to find the appropriate forces to help the guys in Bakhmut. There is no part of Ukraine about which one can say that it can be abandoned,” Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy said the battle for Bakhmut and the surrounding Donbas region was “our first priority”."

                    "bodyText": "It’s official: HS2 will be delayed by another two years and major roadbuilding schemes will be mothballed. Ministers have confirmed the move, our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham reports, after soaring inflation added billions to the cost of transport infrastructure projects. Ministers insisted they remained committed to Britain’s high-speed rail network scheme, but the budget constraints have cast doubt over prospects for the rail project’s delivery. Parts of the HS2 line between Birmingham, Crewe and Manchester will be “rephased” by two years, while trains may now not run all the way into central London until years later than planned as the government “takes time to ensure we have an affordable and deliverable station design” at Euston. The biggest road schemes will also be kicked into the long grass as transport budgets face swingeing real-terms cuts from 2025. The flagship Lower Thames Crossing, a £7bn tunnel and road scheme linking Essex and Kent, will be deferred for at least two years, into the next five-year phase of National Highways’ roadbuilding. The transport secretary, Mark Harper, said: “We have seen significant inflationary pressure and increased project costs, and so we will rephase construction by two years, with an aim to deliver high-speed services to Crewe and the north west as soon as possible after accounting for the delay in construction.” Here’s the full story: Time to recap… here are today’s main stories: Morrisons and Asda have both started some of the restrictions on fruit and salad purchases. Asda has lifted limits on customers buying cucumbers, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries, after the retailer said supply of these items had improved. However, customers are still limited to buying a maximum of three packets of tomatoes and peppers each, but Asda said the situation is easing, and it expects to return to normal levels within a couple of weeks. Morrisons has also removed the cap on purchases of cucumbers, but is still limiting shoppers to a maximum of two packets of tomatoes, lettuce and peppers per customer Delaying HS2’s rollout could be a “body blow” to the economic recovery, warns Stephen Marcos Jones, CEO of the Association for Consultancy and Engineering (ACE). ACE represents the companies who design, deliver and manage our national infrastructure and built environment. Marcos Jones argues that delays would push up the construction cost in the long run: “Today’s news on HS2 is potentially a real body blow for the UK’s economic recovery. I think every sensible person knows that global events have driven inflationary pressures to record highs. “But we have already spent significant sums on the design and delivery of this transformational major project. Scaling back ambitions at this stage will mean the economic and social benefits of HS2 for communities across the UK is further watered down – and major delays like this are actually going to cost more in the longer term. “In a nutshell, the delays announced today are, quite simply, an absolutely false economy.” The boss of Shell has warned that the next few winters are a worry for energy supply in Europe and that the continent needed to move away from reliance on luck for energy security. Shell CEO Wael Sawan told the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston that: “We haven’t structurally resolved the issues on energy security in Europe.” The supermarket chain Morrisons slumped to a £1.5bn loss during its first full year in private equity ownership, according to its latest results. The grocery retailer was bought by the US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R) for £7bn in October 2021 after an intense bidding war. The results for the period from late July 2021 to the end of October last year reveal the grocer’s struggles during the first year after it was taken private and delisted from the London Stock Exchange. Morrisons – which employs more than 110,000 staff, including 95,000-plus working in its 500 supermarkets – made an operating loss of £58m before exceptionals for the 65 weeks to 30 October, according to a trading update from the chain’s parent company filed at Companies House. A substantial portion of its £1.5bn pre-tax loss for the period was related to finance costs of £593m, which included interest payments on external debt, as well as interest on its lease liabilities and interest payable on loans to group companies. The loss contrasts with the £201m pre-tax profit before one-offs made by the retailer made during its final year as a public company, on sales of £17.5bn. Here’s the full story: And here’s our recent investigation into the situation at Morrisons: Wall Street has opened higher, after the rise in US unemployment claims last week calmed some concerns about rising interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 130 points, or 0.4%, at 32,928, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index has gained 0.35%. Bonds are recovering a little too: EDF Energy has said today it will extend the lifetimes of its Hartlepool and Heysham 1 nuclear plants in Britain by two years to March 2026, Reuters reports. They had been slated for closure in 2024. Keeping them open for longer could help the UK’s energy security. Matt Sykes, managing director of EDF’s generation business, says: Supplying zero-carbon and affordable electricity, whatever the weather, has never been more important than right now. Our ongoing investment and careful stewardship of the UK nuclear fleet since 2009 has allowed us to make today’s decision and helps support the UK’s energy security at this challenging time. UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt could afford to raise public sector wages, and to provide targeted support for households with energy bills, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research says. The thinktank has calculated that the chancellor has a large amount of fiscal space ahead of his budget on 15 March, thanks to higher revenue and lower spending, together with the more favourable outlook for GDP and interest rates. These factors mean the budget deficit his year is £30bn less than expected last November. NIESR says: At the macroeconomic level, some of this fiscal space should be used to reduce the planned rise in corporation tax, which would otherwise lower investment and GDP in both the short run and long run, and to increase the amount of public investment. Lower effective corporation tax and increased public investment are both growth-enhancing. The Chancellor should allow public-sector wages to rise to catch up with the private sector, given private-sector wages have been rising much faster than public-sector wages of late. We can expect some spillovers from public-sector wage growth to the private sector, but any adverse macroeconomic effects need to be assessed against potential output losses if the public sector lost skilled workers. A more targeted approach to provide support for households to deal with the high energy prices: specifically, a combination of an opt-in Social Tariff system and a Variable Price Cap. This is preferable in fiscal terms to a universal EPG [energy price guarantee], as this might cost as much as £29bn for 2023-24, and would provide both incentives to users of energy to limit demand, and also more support to those households who need it most. The market reaction to the rise in US unemployment claims shows that Bad News is Good News again for investors. Wall Street futures have pared their earlier losses (as a weak economy will mean interest rates won’t rise as high as feared). The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless support has jumped. In the week to 4 March, there were 211,000 initial claims for unemployment insurance, up from 190,000 the previous week. That 21,000 increase in initial claims suggests that the US jobs market softened last week, although initial claims are still historically low. The number of people receiving at least two week’s of support also rose by 69,000 to 1,718,000 The dollar has weakened, as investors calculate that this may be a sign that the economy is slowing, meaning further increases in interest rates may not be as high as expected. This has pushed the pound up half a cent to $1.19, recovering some of its losses earlier this week. Tomorrow’s Non-Farm Payroll will show how many jobs were created in February. Layoffs by US companies in the first two months of this year have hit their highest level since 2009 after the financial crisis, a report has shown. The tech sector accounting for more than a third of the more than 180,000 job cuts announced in January and February, the report from employment firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas shows. In February alone, layoffs in the United States stood at 77,770, more than five times higher than the 15,245 job cuts announced a year ago. The employers’ organisation BusinessLDN has criticised the expected delays to HS2. John Dickie, chief executive at BusinessLDN, warns that the move could push up the cost of the project: Delaying construction of HS2 to save money is a false economy. Failing to invest now will likely increase costs over the long-term while also delaying the benefits for people and businesses across England. The country needs this project to remain on track through swift and efficient delivery to drive long-term growth and decarbonisation. Slowing down construction of sections will do little to help levelling-up, particularly in the North. With shovels already in the ground, we cannot afford yet another delay. Ministers should not hit the brakes and instead seize this once-in-a-generation opportunity to create a world-class, high-speed, capacity-boosting rail line that will transform connectivity between England’s major cities. Like other construction projects, HS2 has been hit by rising costs of energy, fuel, raw materials and labour. European stock markets have dropped into the red this morning, amid anxiety about rising interest rates. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has dropped by 54 points, or 0.7%, to 7875 points, further away from the record highs set last month. Endeavour Mining, which owns and operates gold mines in Côte d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Senega, are the top faller, down almost 5% after reporting a 26% drop in EBITDA earnings for last year. Mining group Rio Tinto (-4.6%) is next, followed by packaging firm DS Smith (4.5%) which reported signs of weakness in the corrugated box market today. Investors are anticipating that the US Federal Reserve could lift its key interest rates by half a percentage point this month, following warnings from Fed chair Jerome Powell this week that interest rates are ‘likely to be higher’ than previously anticipated. The Fed’s challenge is to slow inflation without sinking the economy, as Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: Sticking with 25bps this month would risk further loosening of financial conditions, which will only make the job to tame inflation harder. Unless there is a stinker of a jobs report tomorrow, the Fed will either need to go with 50bps or do 25bps and stress a much higher terminal rate. And this comes back to the central dilemma – once a structural inflationary dynamic is let loose, the only way to rein it back in is to crash the economy, Volcker style. [Paul Volcker put the US economy into a recession in the 1980s to get inflation under control]. Responding to the report that the high-speed HS2 project will be delayed or cut, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s official spokesman has said: “ou will know there’s work already under way on HS2. Equally the rail minister has been clear we’re continuing to look at any cost pressures and ensure the project delivers value for money for taxpayers. Supermarkets have started to drop customer limits on buying certain fresh fruit and vegetables as supply issues that led to widespread shortages begin to ease. Asda confirmed it had removed limits of three on cucumbers, lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries, leaving restrictions of three on just tomatoes and peppers, PA Media reports. The supermarket said availability overall had improved as expected, and supplies of tomatoes and peppers were also expected to be back to normal within a couple of weeks. Shares in Signature, another crypto-focused bank, are down 20% in premarket trading as the collapse of Silvergate ripples through the sector. Signature has been cutting back its exposure to crypto customers, and on Monday JP Morgan expressed optimism about its prospects. Anders Kvamme Jensen, founder of the global brokerage and digital asset specialist AKJ, explains how Silvergate worked with the crypto sector: While the FTX collapse had a direct impact on liquidity in the crypto markets, Silvergate is merely an infrastructure gateway to exchanges. Most crypto hedge funds have developed relationships with multiple banks, also traditional ones, and are already well diversified on banking and other destinations following FTX. Traditional banks are cumbersome to deal with for transactions on crypto exchanges but looks better optically to an investor and is often used to onboard a fund these days. The fund manager will thereafter use more crypto oriented banks, like Signature, to enter crypto exchanges. Economics professof Nouriel Roubini, who has said that “literally 99% of crypto is a scam”, isn’t shedding a tear for Silvergate: Shares in the Cardiff-based semiconductor company IQE have plunged by around a third this morning, after it reported a fall in orders. IQE, which makes semiconductor wafer products and advanced material solutions to the global semiconductor industry, told the City that weaker demand has led to inventory build-up throughout the supply chain since mid-January. Similar trends are evident across the industry, it says, citing reports that global industry sales of chips fell 18.5% in January. IQE expect that this “near-term market softness” will be temporary, but it’s a sign of weakness in worldwide economic activity. This inventory pile-up means that IQE now expects first-half sales in 2023 to drop by some £30m, a fall of more than one-third from the £86 million in revenues generated between January and June 2022. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould warns that IQE now has “little or no chance” of meeting sales forecasts for this year. Shares are down 31.5% at 32.2p. While IQE is only a small player in the global industry, the latest warning feels ominous, Mould says: First, IQE the sharp drop in sales now expected for the first half means that management is already getting out the prayer mat for 2023 and hoping for an upturn in the second half. IQE is not the first UK-quoted firm to express this hope – just this week Spirent, Ibstock and STV have done the same, following Croda, Coats and others – but it does make the company and its shareholders a hostage to fortune if that second-half pick up fails to materialise. And while IQE is expressing greater confidence in the latter half of 2023, thanks to indications of demand from customers, these are presumably the self-same customers who led the company up the garden path in 2022 and obliged IQE to issue profit warnings when incoming business levels undershot expectations. Industry specialists are busily cutting their global sales forecasts for the semiconductor industry in 2023. They are now looking for a 12% drop in 2023, having started the year looking for a decline of just 3%. The Conservative MP Simon Clarke, former chief secretary to the Treasury, has welcomed the reports that construction of some parts of HS2 will be delayed to save money. Clarke says (via PA Media): This would be a sensible decision. Having observed HS2’s progress as chief secretary, I have serious doubts as to value for money and cost control. The government is set to announce that construction of certain sections of the HS2 rail line will be delayed to save money, our transport correspondent, Gwyn Topham, reports: Ministers are preparing to deliver more bad news on HS2, with a statement expected imminently outlining both the extent of budget overruns and more cost-cutting proposals as soaring inflation hammers the high-speed rail line’s construction. At least £2bn more will be needed for the first London-Birmingham stretch alone since the last official update in October, well above the contingency sums in the initial £44.6bn funding and will dampen further the prospects for the full network’s delivery. While the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and Downing Street reiterated in January that the government will build the line between London Euston and Manchester, the Department for Transport has been under mounting pressure to find cost savings from HS2 – or leave other, non-HS2 rail investment projects to lapse. Ministers have repeated their commitment to a £96bn rail plan drawn up last year but the final results of that spending are likely to be less than anticipated. Here’s the full story: And here’s the BBC’s Simon Jack’s take: The recruitment firm PageGroup has reported that it is still a struggle to find candidates for jobs, despite the economic jitters. In its latest financial results, this morning, PageGroup said the employment market remained hot, after its profits hit record levels last year. Nicholas Kirk, chief executive officer, says: Looking forward, there remains a high level of global macro-economic and political uncertainty in the majority of our markets. However, against this backdrop, we continue to see candidate shortages and good levels of vacancies. PageGroup, which earns fees by placing candidates at companies, reported that its operating profits jumped to £196.1m for 2022 from £168.5m in 2021. One in 10 UK businesses were affected by industrial action in January, figures from the Office for National Statistics show. The ONS reports that more than a quarter (26%) of those businesses reporting that they were unable to fully operate as a consequence. Train staff, National Highways workers, nurses and teachers all held strike action early this year, as unions pushed for pay rises to protect workers from soaring inflation. The ONS also reports that one in eight businesses with 10 or more employees experienced global supply chain disruption in January – a shortage of materials was the most likely cause. And half of businesses reported that they were able to get the materials, goods or services they needed from within the UK in January 2023 without encountering any supply issues. Many houses are being sold under the asking price, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) reports. RICS’ monthly survey has found that in “the mainstream market”, covering prices up to £500k, around 60% of respondents suggested that prices were being agreed at below the asking price. But, sellers of more expensive houses are more likely to accept a ‘discount’. For properties priced between £500k and £1m, the share jumped to just over 70%. MPs are urging the financial regulator to protect investors who fall victim to ‘greenwashing’ claims. The Treasury committee is concerned that investors who are tricked by rogue claims should not have to pay to move investments to funds which are properly labelled as ‘sustainable’. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is looking to introduce criteria that a UK investment fund would need to meet to describe itself as ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’ or similar. The Treasury Committee is concerned that the regulator will not seek redress for customers who have been sold misleading investments, and might choose to move to actual ‘green’ funds. Such a move could incur charges. Following correspondence with the FCA, Harriett Baldwin MP, chair of the Treasury committee, says investors who are tricked by greenwashing claims should not foot the bill for moving their money to actually sustainably funds. Baldwin explains: Consumers who invested in funds believing they were doing their bit to save the planet must not be made to bear the cost of moving if they find out their fund isn’t so green after all. Without a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis, the regulator’s proposals are lop-sided. Further work on what the costs are going to be, who will pay, and how the regulator will enforce the rules is clearly necessary. In recent correspondence to the committee, the FCA assumed that one third of funds currently claiming to be sustainable would no longer qualify for a sustainable label, and another third would decide not to use the label, the committee says. The UK housing market is not about to fall off a cliff, predicts Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, despite the pressure on prices revealed by RICS today. Bill predicts prices will only drop by ‘a few percent’ this year: The further we get from the mini-Budget, the more things improve in the UK housing market. Asking prices will continue to come under pressure as buyers recalculate what they can afford but the market is not about to go over a cliff. The weak start to the year for mortgage approvals means bigger lenders will be focussed on market share, which will keep downwards pressure on rates but the key for buyers is the overall sense of stability rather than movements in borrowing costs that are likely to be small. Transaction levels will come down from the heights seen during the pandemic and we expect prices to fall by a few percent but the evidence is that 2023 will be a solid year for the housing market. UK software group WANdisco has asked for its shares to be suspended after discovering “potentially fraudulent irregularities” in its trading. WANdisco told shareholders that an investigation by its chief executive and chief financial officer had found that it may have materially mis-stated its financial position, and its revenues. WANdisco says it discovered “significant, sophisticated and potentially fraudulent irregularities” in its orders and revenues, “as represented by one senior sales employee”. It told the City: The identification of these irregularities will significantly impact the Company’s cash position and lead to a material uncertainty regarding its overall financial position and significant going concern issues. WANdisco now expects its revenues for the 2022 financial year could be as low as $9m, not the $24m previously reported. It also has “no confidence” in the expectations for bookings in the final quarterof the year. As a result, the company has asked for its shares be suspended from trading on the AIM market in London while it conducts an investigation with its external legal and professional advisers into the nature of this activity and its true financial position. Earlier this week, WANdisco said it was in the “early stages” of examing a dual listing in New York to sit alongside its London-listed shares. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, tells us: After an impressive share price performance since the start of the year, up 43%, this black swan event has the potential to sharply derail its bull run and result in a significant negative rerating in the stock’s valuation, depending on the outcome of the investigation. Just this week, shares hit a 12-month high after it announced plans for an additional listing in the United States, adding to the debate about whether a growing number of businesses are opting for a New York listing over a London equivalent. Whether these potentially fraudulent irregularities stands in the way of its plans for a dual listing is yet to be seen. In other energy news, the recently departed chief executive of Shell’s pay jumped more than 50% to nearly £10m in 2022. The package includes a multi-million pound bonus labelled “jaw-dropping” by campaigners. The total pay package of Ben van Beurden, who stood down at the end of last year, rose from £6.3m in 2021 to £9.7m in 2022. His bonus rose from £2.2m in 2021 to £2.6m in 2022. Last month Shell posted record profits of $40bn for 2022, fuelled by a surge in wholesale gas prices linked to the war in Ukraine. The profits led to calls for a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas companies to be toughened. Van Beurden’s payout is likely to cause anger among campaigners calling for executive pay to be curbed against the backdrop of the cost of living crisis. Alice Harrison, the fossil fuels campaign leader at Global Witness, said: It’s shocking but not surprising that one of the world’s richest oil and gas giants can hand its CEO a jaw-dropping bonus while hardworking people – nurses, paramedics, teachers – must strike to get fair pay. It’s a sign of just how broken our energy system is that Shell and other fossil fuel companies have made record-breaking profits from an energy crisis that’s forcing families to choose between heating their homes and putting food on the table. The North Sea’s biggest producer has hit out at the windfall tax on oil and gas companies after a near 700% surge in profits to $2.5bn (£2.1bn)) was “all but wiped out” by the levy. Harbour Energy has reported that its pre-tax profits rose sharply last year to $2.5bn, up from $315m in 2021, lifted by the surge in wholesale energy prices following the Ukraine war. However, its after-tax profits fell from $101m in 2021 to just $8m in 2022, and it’s taken a large one-off tax charge of the related to the energy profits levy. Harbour said it has paid $205m in UK windfall tax since it was introduced last May. Chief executive Linda Cook said production rates, margins and safety had improved, adding: However, the UK energy profits levy, which applies irrespective of actual or realised commodity prices, has disproportionately impacted the UK-focused independent oil and gas companies that are critical for domestic energy security. For Harbour, the UK’s largest oil and gas producer, it has all but wiped out our profit for the year. This has driven us to reduce our UK investment and staffing levels. Here’s the full story: Overnight, JP Morgan Chase (JPMC) launched legal action against its former top executive Jes Staley, the ex CEO of Barclays, over his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Reuters has the details: The largest US bank filed two complaints on Wednesday night in Manhattan federal court, where it is also defending against lawsuits by the US Virgin Islands and a unnamed woman, Jane Doe 1, who say JPMorgan aided in Epstein’s sex trafficking by keeping him as a client. JPMorgan said Staley should cover some or all damages if it were found liable, and pay punitive damages for his “intentional and outrageous conduct” in concealing information about Epstein and putting his own and Epstein’s interests above the bank’s. The Wall Street bank also wants Staley to repay all compensation from 2006 to 2013. Based on industry standards, that amount could total tens of millions of dollars. More here: JPMorgan sues former banker Staley over Jeffrey Epstein ties Staley developed a relationship with Epstein in 2000, when he was hired to lead JP Morgan’s private bank. In January, court documents accused Jes Staley, who stepped down as Barclays boss in 2021, of having a “profound friendship” with Epstein, which could “even suggest that Staley may have been involved in Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation”. A lawyer for Staley had previously said “we wish to make it expressly clear that our client had no involvement in any of the alleged crimes committed by Mr Epstein”. The collapse of Silvergate comes after the bank failed to restore financial stability amid the crypto currency turmoil, explains Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor: Shares in Silvergate Capital plunged 43.79% after-hours extending a drop of 7.8% during yesterday’s session stateside. The cryptocurrency-centred lender announced plans to wind down in the wake of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. $8 billion of deposits were pulled from Silvergate resulting in a $1 billion fourth quarter net loss amid a ‘crisis of confidence’ among investors about the potential ripple effect from FTX’s high profile demise. This year the bank had been trying to improve its financial position by cutting 40% of its workforce or around 200 jobs. However Silvergate has failed to restore financial stability, now opting for voluntary liquidation instead. Aside from the FTX scandal, crypto-focused businesses like Silvergate have been caught up in the volatility across the crypto complex lately with bitcoin shedding nearly 65% of its market value last year. Although cryptos started to recover in January, February was more challenging with bitcoin retreating from its recent highs. Ram Ahluwalia, the chief executive officer of digital investment advisor Lumida Wealth, has said the loss of the Silvergate Exchange Network is disappointing, explaining: It’s more of a strategic loss of critical infrastructure for crypto. Silvergate Exchange Network, was its crypto payments network which enabled round-the-clock transfers between investors and crypto exchanges. Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, says Silvergate’s collapse shows the dangers of a bank becoming overly exposed to one sector. Discouraging banks from providing deposit accounts only exacerbates this problem by creating fewer options for any one sector to obtain banking services. The problem is not about crypto, but concentration risks. In this case, this is a voluntary wind down under California law, which implies that they will be able to make depositors whole. Neither taxpayer money, nor the FDIC, are involved. Hopefully, this situation serves as a needed reminder to regulators of the risk of concentration, which is certainly not unique to the crypto industry, and will cause them to encourage responsible distribution across the banking sector. US senator Elizabeth Warren has tweeted that Silvergate Bank’s failure is “disappointing, but predictable”, and accused the company of “severe due diligence failures”: The decision to wind up Silvergate shows what can happen when “a bank is over-reliant on a risky, volatile sector like cryptocurrencies,” US Senator Sherrod Brown has warned. Senator Brown, who chairs of the Senate Banking Committee, added that: When banks get involved with crypto, it spreads risk across the financial system and it will be taxpayers and consumers who pay the price. GB News saw losses balloon to more than £30m last year, as staff costs surged as it signed new talent and advertisers remained wary of the right-leaning news operation, our media correspondent Mark Sweney reports. The controversy-prone channel, which last week regulator Ofcom ruled broke impartiality for misleading viewers about Covid-19 boosters, racked up a pre-tax loss of £30.68m in the year to the end of May 2022. The TV channel, and a more recent launch as a digital radio station, is aiming to provide a viable news alternative to established players such as Sky and the BBC. However, the fledgling operation has spent a turbulent first almost two years weathering on and off-air turmoil and trying to shake a reputation as the “British Fox News”, and has found it difficult to win over advertisers wary of associating with its at times controversial output. GB News made just £3.6m in turnover over the year - with the two biggest streams being £3m from advertising revenue and just over £550,000 in digital revenue. The company reported a bill of £12.75m for its 175 staff at the end of May last year, up from 16 staff and less than £1m a year earlier when it was in start up mode. Despite the ballooning losses, up from £3m when GB News filed its first public financial report for 2021, the company said that it continues to have the support of its backers for the foreseeable future. “The company’s aim is to champion robust, balanced debate and to provide a range of perspectives on the issues that affect everyone in the UK,” it said in financial filings published on Thursday, adding: The directors are confident about the future outlook for the company. Last August there was a shakeup among its backers, with the founding investor Discovery selling up, and the existing shareholders Sir Paul Marshall, the Brexiter hedge fund tycoon, and Legatum, the Dubai-based investment company founded by the New Zealand billionaire Christopher Chandler, taking control. Financial accounts for Discovery’s UK business subsequently revealed that it sold its 25% stake for £8m, a 60% drop on the original £20m it paid, which would suggest the value of GB News has fallen from £80m at launch to £32m. The latest £60m funding round, in which the co-founders Andrew Cole and Mark Schneider resigned as directors and sold their stakes, could sustain GB News for a number of years if it chose to cut costs dramatically. “This renewed investment in the company gives GB News the financial capability to build for the long term in what is a hugely competitive market,” said GB News. UK house prices “remain on a downward trajectory”, according to a new poll of property surveyors released this morning. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) has reported that house prices continued to slip across the country last month. The RICS house price balance, which measures the difference between the percentage of surveyors seeing rises and falls in house prices, has dropped to -48 in February from -46 the previous month, which is the lowest reading since April 2009. However, there are also signs that the market is stabilising, as it recovers from the surge in mortgage rates after the calamatous mini-budget last September. RICS found that property surveyors are less gloomy about the prospects for the housing market, as a slump in new buyer enquiries eased. Tarrant Parsons, senior economist at RICS, says the increase in borrowing costs continues to dampen the market. The housing market continues to adjust to the tighter lending climate, with stretched mortgage affordability still weighing heavily on activity. Given the ongoing weakness in demand, house prices remain on a downward trajectory, and are expected to see further falls through the first half of the year at least. Going forward, near-term expectations suggest market activity will remain generally subdued over the coming months, although the latest survey feedback shows tentative signs that the ongoing decline in buyer enquiries is now moderating. The lender Nationwide reported that house prices fell at the fastest annual rate since 2012 last month, but Halifax found that they rose by 1.1%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The turmoil in the crypto sector following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX has claimed crypto-focused bank Silvergate. Silvergate Capital Corp announced last night that it plans to wind down Silvergate Bank‘s operations and voluntarily liquidate it in an orderly fashion, after incurring losses following the dramatic collapse of FTX in November. Silvergate is one of the few mainstream financial organisations to have focused on providing services to the cryptocurrency sector. That helped it grow rapidly until the ‘crypto winter’ began last year, when prices of crypto assets tumbled. Silvergate announced that: In light of recent industry and regulatory developments, Silvergate believes that an orderly wind down of Bank operations and a voluntary liquidation of the Bank is the best path forward. The Bank’s wind down and liquidation plan includes full repayment of all deposits. The Company is also considering how best to resolve claims and preserve the residual value of its assets, including its proprietary technology and tax assets. The news sent Silvergate’s share price slumping in after hours trading, down 43% to $2.76. They’re down over 96% over the last 12 months. Once a small community bank, Silvergate reinvented itself during the crypto boom to provide services to companies that struggled to work with conventional financial providers. The collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX in November created a crisis of confidence in the sector, and drove investors to pull money from Silvergate. At the start of January, Silvergate reported that customers had pulled more than $8bn (£6.7bn) of their crypto-related deposits in the final quarter of last year, forcing it to sell billions of dollars of assets to protect its balance sheet. Silvergate’s future has been in doubt since it delayed the publication of its annual report last week, and announced a fresh sale of assets to repay debts.

                    "bodyText": "Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it had been “a difficult night” as Russian strikes hit targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Ukrainian officials said Moscow had fired six of its Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, an unprecedented number, which Ukraine has no way of shooting down. Russia is believed to have only a few dozen of the missiles. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions were reported in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, reported five people had been killed in a strike on the Zolochiv district. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, said two women in their 70s had been injured by a strike on Pisochyn. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, reported that three people were killed in the southern city of Kherson. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has described the overnight strikes as without military purpose and “just Russian barbarism”. The strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid, the company Energoatom said. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for ten days,” the company said in a statement. In a statement, Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the site’s safety and security. He said: “This is the sixth time that the plant has lost all off-site power and has had to operate in this emergency mode. Each time we are rolling a dice, and if we allow this to continue then one day our luck will run out.” Zelenskiy has said he will not meet Vladimir Putin until Russia leaves Ukraine. Ukraine’s president appeared on CNN on Wednesday night in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet Putin, Zelenskiy said: “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word” and “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that.” Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday, during a press conference with his Saudi counterpart, that Saudi Arabia was among the countries that had facilitated prisoner of war swaps with Ukraine. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Transnistria’s security forces claim Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans. The Kremlin said on Thursday it doubted the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines could have been carried out without state support, after the New York Times reported that a pro-Ukrainian non-government group might have been responsible for the blasts. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was vital to identify who was behind the attacks which ruptured the multi-billion dollar pipelines last September. He added that it was incomprehensible that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. Ukraine will take part in European Union countries’ scheme to jointly buy gas, the bloc’s energy policy chief said on Thursday. Slovakia needs to make a decision on sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the country’s defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said on Thursday, adding Poland has expressed willingness to act jointly in this matter. The city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine’s east, could fall in the next few days, said the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. “What we see is that Russia is throwing more troops, more forces and what Russia lacks in quality they try to make up in quantity. They have suffered big losses, but at the same time, we cannot rule out that Bakhmut may eventually fall in the coming days,” he said on Wednesday. The founder of the mercenary Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, which has been leading the Russian assault on Bakhmut, said on Wednesday Russian forces now fully control the east of the city. The claims have not been independently verified. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in its Wednesday morning report: “The enemy, despite significant losses, continues to storm the town of Bakhmut.” Russia is unlikely to capture significantly more territory this year, according to the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines. She told a Senate hearing on Wednesday that the military will probably be unable to carry on its current level of fighting, even with the possible capture of Bakhmut. The Pentagon has been accused of blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC) about Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The defence department is said to be firmly opposed to using The Hague-based ICC, as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers. Zelenskiy has invited the US House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, to visit Ukraine as doubts over support for Kyiv’s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelenskiy proposed the visit in an interview with CNN on Wednesday. The US obtained a warrant to seize a Boeing aircraft owned by Russian oil company Rosneft that is valued at over $25m (£21m), the US justice department said. The district court for the eastern district of New York authorised the seizure, based on violations of export controls and sanctions against Russia, the department said. In a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Wednesday, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, told journalists it was “critical” that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of Ukraine across the Black Sea be renewed, with Ukraine traditionally being one of the world’s largest exporters of grain. A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal. The Kremlin, however, said on Thursday there were still “a lot of questions” remaining over the deal, and that there were currently no plans for a direct meeting with Guterres. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Wednesday he had suggested the bloc spend €1bn (£890m) for the joint procurement of ammunition for Ukraine and to refill their own stockpiles. “I propose to mobilise another €1bn,” Reuters reported he told the media after a meeting of EU defence ministers in Stockholm."

                    "bodyText": "On 21 May 2022, after hours of impassioned debate, members of Finland’s Green party voted to make theirs the first in the world to back nuclear power. Greens in Finland would now campaign not only for the lifespan of current reactors to be extended but also for new plants, with the technology recognised by their manifesto as “sustainable energy”. It was a decision that upended decades of environmentalist orthodoxy – by campaigners who, in many cases, cut their teeth in opposition to nuclear. And, for Tea Törmänen, it was the culmination of years of campaigning. She and others in the Finnish Greens for Science and Technology group had argued that only through the adoption of nuclear power and other technologies could human societies decarbonise fast enough to avert climate breakdown. Writing later, the biologist, who is also a former chair of Finland’s Ecomodernist Society, said: “For me it was a moment that was long overdue.” As anxiety grows over the extent of climate and ecological crises, fear for the future is loading an ever more desperate calculus in favour of radical action. For some, this could include environmentalists embracing technologies previously regarded as unacceptable. But could Britain’s green movement go nuclear? Last month, Törmänen was in a London meeting with UK activists to see if it can. RePlanet are the pro-nuclear, pro-GMO vegans who have come to shake up the environmental movement. Newly formed of an international network of pro-technology environmental campaign groups, they believe doubling down on technology and progress is the key to solving the climate and ecological crises. Now, with funding from climate philanthropists, they are spreading out from a core in northern Europe with a plan to “pivot the mainstream” across the continent. But their proposals look set to put them on a collision course with traditional environmentalists. In a video fronted by the environmental campaigner and Guardian columnist George Monbiot they have entreated the public to go vegan, calling for animal products to be replaced by fats and proteins grown in genetically modified microbial soup. In Germany they are campaigning for the government to end its phase out of nuclear power and in Finland and the Netherlands they have helped guarantee the industry’s future. At the EU level they successfully argued that nuclear should be included in its taxonomy of green energy sources, while at the same time campaigning against the bloc’s organic farming targets and longstanding ban on genetically modified crops. They have hired two seasoned activists, Joel Scott-Halkes and Emma Smart, to manage their UK campaign. With backgrounds in Extinction Rebellion, both have proven themselves committed to radical climate action. Scott-Halkes went on to join radical vegan offshoot Animal Rebellion, while Smart’s activism with Insulate Britain earned her spells in jail. A third British campaigner, the environmental writer Mark Lynas, a former staunch opponent of GM who reversed his views, is a co-founder. RePlanet has its roots in a network of “ecomodernist” groups and societies established since 2015, after the publication of An Ecomodernist Manifesto. That document, signed by Lynas among others, upended traditional environmentalist philosophy. Instead of calling for humans to live in harmony with nature, for degrowth and moderation, the ecomodernists double down on technology as a means to minimise the human impact on Earth, while providing for a population of billions. Land sparing lay at the core of the manifesto, with the aim of rewilding as much of the world’s surface as possible by concentrating human activities. Ultimately, they wrote, technology could “decouple” economic growth from planetary systems, and the “wise” use of nuclear power, genetic modification and intensive agriculture would lead “to a good, or even great Anthropocene”. Activists in Finland, the Netherlands and elsewhere took up the charge. But in the UK, reception to the ecomodernists was frosty. Summing up criticisms at the time, Monbiot said ecomodernists “would wish away almost the entire rural population of the developing world”, and they had failed to interrogate the relationships between modernity and proletarianisation, uneven development and poverty. After a botched attempt to reach out across the political spectrum by teaming up with Owen Paterson, a Tory former environment secretary, Lynas admitted attempts to launch the movement in the UK had amounted to a “screw-up of impressive proportions”. Now he is playing a key role in trying to revive ecomodernism. RePlanet, Scott-Halkes explained, had been born out of a process of “rebranding ecomodernism”, jettisoning bits of the philosophy that had “become problematic”. Over the past two years, he said, they had worked together with Monbiot to embed into their approach a critique of power. Where previously ecomodernists had been seen as naively pro-capitalist and pro-technology, RePlanet believe they have faced up to the nuances and dangers of the technologies they are proposing – and the dangers of progress in general. Like classic ecomodernists, they see themselves as “pro-science and evidence-based” supporters of prosperity, who embrace progress, said Scott-Halkes. But there is a new emphasis on development and, befitting its sojourn in social democratic northern Europe, a new faith in “the power of the democratic state to take control of technologies, to develop technologies”. Precision fermentation and nuclear power are emblematic of the kinds of technical fixes they call for. Precision fermentation could, they claim, allow for the entire world’s protein to be produced from an area the size of London. It is not a pipe dream: the same technology is already used to produce most of the world’s insulin and citric acid; in the US, ice-creams containing precision fermented replicas of milk proteins are already on the market. But RePlanet says the technology must be “open sourced” to ensure its democratisation, with precision fermentation breweries in every town. “We’re saying with precision fermentation, in particular, we need to get in there now, because this is food, this is sustenance,” said Scott-Halkes. “If this does come to dominate the global food system we should be advocating for democratic control of it right now. Otherwise, we’re actually genuinely screwed.” Less easy to open source is atomic energy. But Replanet believe it is the only way for humanity to meet the energy needs of a rapidly developing world while decarbonising as fast as possible. “Nuclear is the most land-efficient energy source that has ever been invented,” Scott-Halkes said. “It is by various degrees 300 times more land efficient than wind power, 150 times more efficient than solar power, uncountably, 4,000 to 5,000 times more land efficient than biofuels. If you want space [for] rewilding, you need nuclear.” Finland is the “gold standard” of what RePlanet hopes to achieve. Not only have ecomodernists there managed to persuade the Green party to adopt nuclear power, but in December the party’s council agreed to a dismantling of restrictions on GM. With 20 seats in Finland’s parliament, such policy decisions have force. In the UK they have further to go. When pronuclear campaigners appeared on protests at Cop26 in Glasgow last year they were accused of being paid shills of the industry. Critics of precision fermentation argue it is a complicated technology prone to centralisation, when accessible, localised, resilient and above all natural food sources are needed. Rob Percival, head of food policy at the Soil Association, which certifies organic food in the UK, described RePlanet’s Reboot Food campaign on Twitter as “akin to the rewilding movement getting hooked on GMO-steroids”. Percival said it was important for campaign groups to push boundaries, and he agreed with the potential for precision fermentation to displace intensive animal farming. “But they are pushing this land-sparing concept to quite an extreme conclusion,” he said. “I think it’s unwise in that intensive systems have proven time and again to be liable to corporate capture, bad for the soil, heavily reliant on chemicals.” Opponents of nuclear say it is far from living up to RePlanet’s promise. Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace’s policy director, said the world needed alternative and clean sources of energy that are quick and cheap to deploy. “Nuclear is the opposite,” he said. “The new plant at Hinkley C is over a decade behind schedule and billions over budget. The next one in line, at Sizewell C, may not even start generating energy until today’s newborns turn teenagers. Crucially, we don’t need new nuclear. Solar and wind technologies are a much cheaper and quicker way to cut carbon emissions, and studies show we can keep the lights on with a wholly renewable energy system. All we need is the political will to make it happen.” Even Monbiot, who has helped to craft RePlanet’s updated ecomodernism, qualifies his support for the group’s ideas. He is known as an advocate for organic farming, which RePlanet has campaigned against. But he insists, nevertheless, that fresh thinking is needed to resolve the crises affecting the environment. “I broadly agree that we have to assess every issue from first principles, and we can’t afford to be blinded by prejudices against certain technologies,” Monbiot said. “We have to assess them all case by case, and we might come down in slightly different places on some of those technologies, but broadly I think we are on the same page.” RePlanet are not the only advocates of high-tech solutions to green problems. Taking his cue from Marx’s embracing of modernity as the grounds for revolutionary change, Matt Huber, author of Climate Change as Class War, dismisses degrowthers’ vision as “almost as austere as Pol Pot’s”. Adopting a more populist tone, the leftwingers clustered around the UK’s Novara Media news website have advocated for “fully automated luxury communism”, which went on to become the title of founder Aaron Bastani’s debut book. Most significantly, those with the money and power to actually bring ideas into implementation also seem to back technological solutions. Vast sums have already been invested into GM, plans are afoot for direct CO2 capture via huge industrial machinery and the cost-benefit analysis around geoengineering is increasingly regarded as worth the risk. Ecomodernism may not, yet, be the most popular idea among those who are campaigning for a solution to planetary crises created by humanity. But it increasingly looks as though it may be the one we will get."

                    "bodyText": "Donald Trump has not yet announced a deal to write a White House memoir but he will publish a second post-presidential book next month – reportedly including controversial correspondence with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea. According to Axios, which reported the news on Thursday, Letters to Trump will contain 150 private letters written over more than 40 years, and from figures also including Hillary Clinton, Richard Nixon and Oprah Winfrey. Trump’s letters with Kim, the leader of a nuclear adversary, have been a source of considerable controversy. In 2018, Trump told a rally in Virginia he and Kim were “really being tough… and then we fell in love, OK? No, really – he wrote me beautiful letters, and they’re great letters.” But Kim letters became a source of trouble when it emerged such documents were part of a trove of confidential material Trump took to Mar-a-Lago in Florida when he left the White House in disgrace in January 2021, after the Capitol riot. Trump’s retention of classified documents is one subject under investigation by Jack Smith, a special counsel appointed by Merrick Garland, the US attorney general. According to Axios, the Winfrey letter, sent in 2000, the year Trump flirted with a run for president with the Reform Party, says: “Too bad we’re not running for office. What a team!” Winfrey says compliments Trump included in a book “made me a little weepy” and adds: “It’s one thing to try and live a life of integrity – still another to have people like yourself notice.” Trump, Axios said, writes: “Sadly, once I announced for president [for the Republican nomination, in 2015], she never spoke to me again.” The new book is set to be published on 25 April by Winning Team, the same publishing company that last year put out Our Journey Together, a picture book covering Trump’s time as president. That book caused controversy when it was revealed Trump blocked plans to publish a similar book by his chief White House photographer, then published himself. A Trump spokesman said then: “President Trump has always had an eye for beautiful and engaging curation, which came alive through the pages of his book.” Like Our Journey Together, Letters to Trump will not be cheap. It will cost $99 – or $399 for a signed copy. The new tome will contain letters from “presidents, royals, celebrities and business titans”, each with photos and commentary from Trump. According to Axios, correspondents also include “Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Princess Diana, Ted Kennedy, Mario Cuomo, Arnold Palmer, Jay Leno, Liza Minnelli, Regis Philbin (salutation: ‘My Dear Trumpster’) and many more”. Winning Team said: “No book offers a glimpse into history quite like Letters to Trump!”"

                    "bodyText": "And that’s where we’ll leave you this evening. Here’s a wrap of the main events today: Labor secured Greens support for the national reconstruction fund after the government agreed to an amendment which means the fund can’t be used for coal and gas projects or for native forest logging. Hundreds of University of Sydney staff and students continued their strike for a seventh day, marking the longest-running campaign of work stoppages at an Australian university. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, said the government would continue to work with Senator David Pocock and others on the crossbench to work through the safeguard mechanism deadlock. Home values fell at a record 12-month pace but the decline is slowing, CoreLogic said. It came as the National Australia Bank became the first of the major banks to lift its home loan rate, passing on the Reserve Bank’s latest official rate rise to customers in full. The government’s voice referendum working group met again, with the Greens’ Adam Bandt and Dorinda Cox joining the meeting. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, said she was concerned about Indigenous infant health as some Closing the Gap targets go backwards. Anthony Albanese said the deepening relationship with India was a “win-win” during his visit to Ahmedabad. The PM also renewed his promise of “absolute sovereignty” as part of the Aukus deal, ahead of a submarine announcement soon. Bill Shorten said the robodebt inquiry analysis showed that a majority of victims were women. The federal government introduced a new category of Help loans in a bid to increase the number and quality of startup businesses in Australia. The Greens introduced a bill to repeal the Regional Forest Agreements Act, which grants logging operations an exemption from national environmental laws. A study published in the journal Nature found that smoke from the 2019-20 black summer bushfires temporarily depleted the ozone layer by 3% to 5% in 2020. Crocodiles have been sighted and residents evacuated as flood waters surge across Queensland’s saturated remote north-west communities. Liberal Alex Antic accused of ‘disgraceful comments’ about Ukraine president The Liberal senator Alex Antic has been accused of “disgraceful comments” about Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, after referring to him as “the little fella from Ukraine” and appearing to forget his name. In a Senate speech, Antic, the conservative senator from South Australia, referred to the president as “whatever his name is, who cares”. In a speech about superannuation this afternoon, Antic wandered off-course to take a swipe at Anthony Albanese for marching in “colourful parades”. Albanese recently marched in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and the WorldPride march across the Harbour Bridge. “It doesn’t matter how many parades the prime minister goes off and marches in, doesn’t matter how many colourful parades he goes and marches in, doesn’t matter how many all-expenses trips he takes to go and visit the global glitterati, the little fella from Ukraine, whatever his name is in the green T-shirt,” Antic said. “Whatever his name is anyway, who cares.” Antic continued his speech and as cries of protest came from other senators, he responded: “I can’t remember what his name is, he’s just on the screen all the time.” The Labor senator and assistant minister for manufacturing, Tim Ayres, interrupted with a point of order. Antic, taking his seat, commented “here we go, this is good”. Ayres asked the acting deputy president, Liberal senator David Van, to ask Antic to withdraw his remarks. “That was an extraordinary reflection on the leader of Ukraine, who for I thought everybody in this place has been a symbol of a very important struggle for democracy and freedom,” Ayres said. Antic withdrew his remarks, adding “anyway we’ll move on. I’ve got respect for democracy.” Uber to refund exorbitant trips during Sydney Trains outage Uber has promised to refund exorbitant trips in Sydney yesterday afternoon when a train shutdown forced commuters to use the service to get home. In a statement, Uber says it will refund anyone who was charged excessively yesterday, adding that the initial price hike came before it knew what was going on: In the past we have been alerted by Transport for NSW when there were Sydney-wide transport issues, however in this instance, we were not informed of the complete outage on the NSW train network until well after it began. As soon as our team became aware of the train disruption, we immediately lowered and capped surge to still incentivise driver-partners who were helping Sydneysiders get home, while making rides more affordable for those stranded. Any rider that was charged an additional amount above that surge cap, for the full duration of the outage, will be auto-refunded within the next 48 hours. Read our story on the fallout from yesterday’s peak-hour meltdown: Victoria’s medical records bill passes parliament’s upper house The Victorian government’s health information sharing bill, which will centralise all medical records across the state’s public health system, has passed parliament’s upper house by 21 votes to 16. Guardian Australia reported yesterday that the Greens had secured increased oversight and privacy protections in exchange for the support of its four MPs, while the Animal Justice party MP, Georgie Purcell, and the two Legalise Cannabis MPs also voted in favour of the bill. From February 2024, public hospitals and services will be able to electronically share patient data – such as health conditions, allergies, medication, medical images and laboratory results – through a centralised database. The government says the new database will allow clinicians to start treatment sooner, reduce medication errors and unnecessary diagnostic tests. It has been welcomed by the Australian Medical Association Victorian branch, which says it is similar to existing schemes in place in New South Wales and Queensland. Only clinicians involved in a patient’s care can access the medical information and only for the purpose of providing care, with penalties of up to two years’ imprisonment for unauthorised access. Coalition calls on Labor to honour commitment to build subs in South Australia The opposition foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, has told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing that it is critical the PM honours the commitment to have the Aukus submarines built in South Australia. Birmingham added that the Coalition had maintained its bipartisan support for the deal, but said there were questions the government needed to answer: The commitment given when the Aukus deal was announced was for the build of at least eight nuclear-powered submarines in Adelaide. It is critical that the Albanese government live up to the expectations they have set for South Australians and for the defence industry in terms of investment, jobs and support. This was a Coalition government achievement to make sure we had defence investment and spending at levels that made us a credible partner to pursue deals such as Aukus. There is talk of the Virginia-class submarines from the United States and then another third potential platform … What will it mean for the Collins-class [submarine]? They are all very fair questions and the government will need to have detailed answers to them. Climate minister refuses to provide safeguard mechanism modelling to Senate On Tuesday we reported the Senate had rejected the government’s public interest immunity claim in refusing to provide modelling of the safeguard mechanism and use of carbon credits. The 4pm Thursday deadline has come and gone, and the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has doubled down. In a letter to the Senate, Bowen said that disclosure of the safeguard mechanism modelling “would not be in the public interest because disclosure would reveal the deliberations of cabinet” and “due to market sensitivities relating to the government’s role as a purchaser” of carbon credits. The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said: It is disappointing the minister has failed to comply with the order of the Senate and is opting for secrecy over transparency. The Senate will now need to consider what recourse we take. The penalty powers of the Senate are significant, including power to deny the minister’s legislation coming to the floor for debate. The Greens are in good-faith negotiations with the government but if they continue to keep this important information secret then we will have to take that into consideration when we decide how we vote. This policy should be about making pollution from coal and gas go down, not letting it increase. If the Government is confident their plan will cut pollution from coal and gas they should release the evidence. NSW awaits weekly Covid numbers with signs a new wave is under way Weekly Covid case numbers are due out tomorrow, with last week’s data in NSW indicating a new wave of transmissions may be under way. Last week NSW recorded 6,941 new Covid cases, an 8.6% increase on the week before, with the NSW Health report noting the increased numbers likely marked “the beginning of a new wave in transmission”. The report also noted there had been an increase in the number of people with Covid attending emergency departments, with 128 in the last report, up from 107 admissions the week before. The new wave, the fourth since the Omicron variant became the dominant variant in the state, could see the first spike in cases since late December 2023. India’s decarbonisation presents good opportunities for Australia, trade minister says The trade minister, Don Farrell, was on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing just now. He talked about how Australia’s trade relationship with India has improved since January, saying that while there was demand for Australia’s fossil fuel, there was also a shift towards decarbonisation. India is very committed to decarbonisation, as is the Albanese government in Australia. I think we have great prospects of expanding our role in that decarbonisation process that’s going on in India. They’re very interested in our critical minerals but they’re also interested in the supply of hydrogen, which of course will take the place of gas as we transition to a decarbonised economy. Farrell was also asked about China, saying he expected to visit the country soon, as relations improve: Look, discussions have been going very well with the Chinese government and the Chinese minister … I’ve been invited to China and I expect that to take place in the near future. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you to take you through the rest of the day’s news. And on that note, I am going to bid you farewell for the week. The next parliament sitting is in another week – so politics live will be back with you then. Tomorrow though, you’ll be back with the Australia news live blog, which will bring you what is happening all over the place, not just what is (mostly) going on in the walls of parliament. A very big thank you to the team who are still beavering away and, of course, to you, who make it all worth it. We truly do have the best audience in Australia and we are very grateful to have your support. We have some exciting projects coming up and can’t wait to share some of them with you. That includes our 10th birthday celebrations during Gemini szn (the best season, obviously). Mostafa Rachani will take you through the evening – so stick around, but I hope you get some time to stare at a wall or do something fun this weekend. And as always – take care of you Ax The former prime minister Paul Keating has issued another statement railing against the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age’s coverage of “the threat from China”. Keating said in today’s statement – the second in three days: The Sydney Morning Herald’s prominent series of provocations, urging Australia into a war with China, concluded its third instalment today. At Item 20 of its presentation, apart from its advocacy of the reintroduction of compulsory national service, it wantonly urges that Australia should further consider ‘basing US long-range missiles armed with nuclear weapons on Australian territory’ and goes on to say ‘if the US were interested in doing so’. In the following point at 21, it refers to ‘the threat from China’. The first point is, there is no threat from China, in any strategic sense. There has never been such a threat from China, either implicit or explicit. But for the Herald’s notion of it, it is urging Australia into a war with China armed with nuclear weapons on our territory to be provided by the United States. Keating – who is on the record many times calling for Australia not to be drawn into a war over the future of Taiwan, a democratically governed island of 24 million people that China has refused to rule out taking by force – repeated that argument today. He described Taiwan as “an island, off the Chinese coast, an island Australia does not recognise as an independent state, and has never recognised as an independent state”. Keating’s three-page statement ended with the line: God help us. Tory Maguire, the executive editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, Brisbane Times and WAToday, said in an emailed response to the first statement on Tuesday: Mr Keating has indulged in personal slurs against the journalists at The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age instead of engaging in the substance of their reporting. It’s not a useful contribution from someone well placed to have a meaningful impact on the conversation about our readiness to protect and defend Australia. Peter Hartcher and Matthew Knott are two of the country’s most highly respected journalists and we stand by their reporting and the expertise of the contributors to the challenging and thought-provoking Red Alert series. We note he had nothing to say when the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Sky News Australia also recently examined the threat of conflict with China and our nation’s preparedness. The blue in the teal rises above the green on franking credits Revisiting the franking credits issue, I have just looked at where the house landed on the Treasury amendment bill. These bills are fairly regular – usually just changes to instruments or closing loopholes and more about the machinery of government and Treasury than anything else. This one though included tightening up the rules around dividend imputation (franking credits) when it comes to how companies raise capital and aligning off-market buybacks with on-market buybacks. (I am not wealthy enough to know all the detail on this, and chances are, neither are most people reading this – it is only going to save about $600m so that is not huge numbers in the scheme of things.) The bill is with the Senate economics committee, which will look at the changes. The Coalition has already called it a broken election promise and argue Labor is coming after franking credits. (This is nowhere near what Labor proposed in 2019.) BUT The teals have split on the amendments. Angus Taylor and the Coalition tried to move an amendment which would have removed the franking credit changes (which doesn’t have a chance of winning in a chamber where the government holds the numbers, but is all about optics). Allegra Spender, Kylea Tink, Sophie Scamps and Zoe Daniel voted with the opposition. Helen Haines and Kate Chaney voted with the government. Zali Steggall abstained and Monique Ryan was absent from the vote because of a family bereavement. This is going to happen – the teal independents represent some of the wealthiest electorates in the country where their constituents care about these things. And at those times, the blue in the teal is going to rise above the green. • This post was updated on 14 March 2023 to reflect the fact that Monique Ryan was absent from the vote, rather than abstained. Queensland releases child sentencing data as raise the age debate drags on The nation’s leaders are dragging their heels when it comes to raising the age of criminal responsibility. Currently, it is 10. Yup, 10. While there are movements from some states and territories to go it alone if there is not national cabinet agreement, not all states are on board. AAP has reported on the Queensland situation: Children aged under 14 make up a very small proportion of people sentenced in Queensland, and alternative approaches could be considered to reduce the risk of reoffending, a report says. Fewer than one in 10 children sentenced in Queensland between 2005 and 2022 were under the age of 14, a Queensland Sentencing Advisory Council report says. Those under the age of 10 make up 1.1% of children sentenced. The council chair, John Robertson, says coming into contact with the criminal justice system at a young age increases the likelihood of reoffending, so there could be a discussion about alternatives. “When we consider the life circumstances of many of these younger children, and the type of offending they engage in, it is not surprising that there are questions being asked about the benefits of criminalising children at such a young age,” the former children’s court president said. Queensland’s age of criminal responsibility is 10, and the report showing low numbers of those under 14 are being sentenced comes amid a national push to increase the age to 12 in all states and territories. However, a draft report last year recommended raising the age to 14 without exception, with the Northern Territory and ACT committing to that and Tasmania planning to lift its minimum age of detention to 14. The Queensland attorney general, Shannon Fentiman, has said she supports a national approach rather than going it alone. The sentencing report comes as state parliament prepares to debate youth justice laws that have bipartisan support but have been condemned by legal groups, social service providers and experts. There’s concern that making it a criminal offence for children to breach bail conditions and handing them longer sentences will put more kids behind bars for longer, increasing their chances of reoffending. The council’s report says more than half of children aged 10 to 13 who were sentenced were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, and that the overrepresentation of Indigenous kids increased among the youngest cohorts. Some 482 children under the age of 14 were sentenced in 2021-22, with 38 of those younger than 12, which was lower than the annual average of 651 over the previous 17 years. “Sentenced cases did not return to pre-pandemic levels,” the report says. More than 80% of children under 13 were sentenced for property offences such as unlawful entry, wilful damage and stealing, with courts giving reprimands or probation orders in more than half of cases. Only 2.1% of child sentences involved detention with almost half of those being for burglary or unlawful entry. “Of the small number of cases involving serious offences sentenced in the higher courts, children under 14 at the time of the offence were most often sentenced for robbery,” Robertson said. “However, this only represented 3.4% of all sentenced robbery cases across Queensland.” Read our story, by Ben Smee, here: The federal government has created a new category of Help loans in a bid to increase the number and quality of startup businesses in Australia. The education legislation amendment (startup year and other measures) bill 2023 – a Labor election commitment first proposed in 2015 – will allow 2,000 entrepreneurs to defer the cost of accessing startup accelerator programs each year. The startup year program was introduced to parliament on Thursday after a six-week consultation on the loam scheme last year. It’s expected to cost the government $15.4m over four years. Education minister Jason Clare: A lot of universities have start up incubators and accelerators and offer grants to students to help them build businesses from scratch. This will add to that, offering HELP loans to bring their business ideas to life.” Universities Australia said the startup year program would bring “much-needed” financial support for university entrepreneurs. Just two Australian cities rank in the top 1,000 for startups globally - Sydney (38) and Melbourne (42). Universities Australia acting chief executive Peter Chesworth said financial barriers hindered the progress of innovation in the higher education sector and its “transformative flow-on effects, including the creation of new jobs and economic opportunities”: Universities support the Albanese government’s commitment to breaking down these barriers and supporting the commercialisation of new ideas and solutions to the challenges and opportunities facing our nation. ‘Giving in to the Greens’ demands is a smack in the face to Tasmanians’: Tammy Tyrrell on NRF Jacqui Lambie Network senator Tammy Tyrrell is not happy with the amendment the Greens have secured as part of the negotiations for the party’s support of the national reconstruction fund. Tyrell says the government owes the Tasmanian forestry industry an apology, after writing to the peak body in May 2022 to say there would be no issues in a Labor government: The prime minister said in his letter: ‘The Liberals have gone into overdrive saying that Labor will listen to the Greens. This is nothing but a desperate scare campaign designed to cover up for the fact that Scott Morrison has been a major disappointment for your industry.’ “ The prime minister also said ‘Labor will support native forest harvesting.’ Giving in to the Greens’ demands is a smack in the face to Tasmanians. The prime minister needs to come out and explain this about face. It’s all well and good to tell the industry you support them during an election, but when you’re in government and push comes to shove, apparently you can forget pretty quickly. I don’t think the Greens are bad people, but my word, sometimes they’ve got some bad ideas. The government’s got to be prepared to call it out, not back it in.” As Caitlin Cassidy says – the AFL could learn from this. But I bet they’ve never had Meatloaf. Tomorrow is the last day of the public hearings for the robodebt royal commission. Here was Bill Shorten’s summary, delivered in question time, of some of what the commission has heard: Analysis of data provided to the royal commission into Robodebt reveals that a majority of Robodebt victims were women. In fact, at least 226,780 Australian women were served unlawful debt notices over four and a half years by the former Coalition government. These are their stories. Angelica. Angelica says that soon after she had a Robodebt raised against her, she had to deal with the grief of her father passing away. She says she didn’t have money in the bank and had her daughter to think of. “My depression became very bad while dealing with the Robodebt. I wanted to kill myself. I started drinking heavily, a couple of bottles of wine each day causing liver problems. I had to go to hospital and my doctor wasn’t happy with me. I started seeing a psychologist. To this day, I still get anxiety when I think about my Robodebt. The government should care about people who are struggling. People who have depression or money troubles. They shouldn’t make their lives worse.” Then there’s Isabella. She received a Robodebt at a particularly difficult point in her life. “I was living day to day when I was hit with a Robodebt. I was homeless due to fleeing from family violence. What little money I was receiving from Centrelink payments went towards my food and my medication. Then one day there was less money in my account than I was expecting for my Newstart allowance, I thought it had been a mistake. I called Centrelink. I was not met with concern for my wellbeing. They told me I had a debt and needed to prove I didn’t owe money.” In a submission to the royal commission by a woman who wishes to remain anonymous, she explains how she was a young, single parent working when she received her Robodebt. “I cried myself to sleep for two weeks thinking about where my daughter would go if I went to jail. I contacted her father for help financially after never receiving child support from him while she was fully in my care. He then decided to take me to court and obtain shared custody of my daughter. Robodebt caused myself depression, anxiety and financial stress, which resulted in me having my daughter taken from my full care. To say Robodebt ruined my life is a complete understatement”. These are stories that were never heard by the Coalition when they were in government. Like a lot of members on this side, I’ve represented people who’ve been injured at work. Compensation is important. It’s expected, but it’s never the full story. Accountability matters to the royal commission cannot reverse the pain of these three brave witnesses. It can’t bring back loved ones, but it can make sure that those who did the wrong thing answer for it. It can. And it must make sure that no government ever unlawfully bullies vulnerable Australians ever. Meanwhile, in remote Queensland: Crocodiles have been sighted and residents evacuated as floodwaters surge across Queensland’s saturated remote north-west communities, AAP reports. Flood warnings are in place for hundreds of kilometres of the Gulf’s inland rivers and creeks as a late-season monsoon trough continues to batter northern Australia. Rainfall records have tumbled as the deluge lashed Queensland’s Far North, potentially isolating remote communities for weeks. Supplies in the towns of Doomadgee and Burke are running low, with buying restrictions in place on essential food items. Roads and highways are cut, with food now being transported by air to ensure adequate food supplies for the region. Overnight, the system continued to batter the region, with falls of 278mm at Riversleigh and 220mm at Century Mine. Julia Creek received 171mm, with 158mm at Dugald River and 148mm at Julius Dam. Severe thunderstorms with heavy rainfall are forecast for Cloncurry and Rollingstone, and south of Croydon and Townsville. The system will also bring widespread rain, thunderstorms and damaging wind gusts to parts of the Northern Territory, the Bureau of Meteorology has warned. Question time ends But wait –the Speaker has a message for those Very Concerned About The Flag (of which Liberal MP Dan Tehan is president) I want to update the house regarding the flag above parliament house. As I stated to the house yesterday, I understand and recognise the importance of the Australian national flag. I am pleased to advise the process has an expedited to replace the flag. Weather permitting protocols will be put in place to replace the flag within the next two days. Furthermore, alternative options and contingencies for this ever happen again for the future. Thank goodness. We can once again sleep at night. Liberal MP’s question about a Sydney mayor and NSW election ruled out of order The Liberal MP for Lindsay, Melissa McIntosh, who has come back to parliament with the strategy of yelling her questions in question time (I have been told that some in Labor have begun referring to the honourable member as Melissa ‘Capslock’ McIntosh) has a question for Chris Bowen: Is it true that the minister has taken time out from the task of tackling rising energy prices to hold discussions with a western Sydney mayor ahead of him announcing he will not run as an independent candidate in the New South Wales election? Did the minister discuss federal government funding or support with the mayor? Tony Burke is on his feet immediately referring the Speaker to “the list of prohibited questions on page 553 of practice. The first dot point.” Milton Dick rules the question out of order. In between all of the Stephen Jones questions, Linda Burney gave this answer to a dixer on Closing the Gap targets: Mick Dodson was the social justice commissioner between 1993 and 1998. And one of the quotes from Mick has stayed with me ever since that time. He talked about a type of industrial deafness that descended upon us as Australians about the dreadful social justice statistics when it came to Aboriginal people in this country. And I think there is something true in what he says in terms of those statistics, washing off us. Washing over us. And flowing on. And the latest Productivity Commission’s data is in fact an example of what I hope everyone will listen to. Some of the Closing the Gap targets are going backwards. And I know many people are frustrated by this lack of progress. I know that I am. On the existing data, 11 targets are now not on track. And four are on track. The one that really concerns me that has, where the statistics have gone backwards slightly, is the healthy birth weight of babies. It has gone backwards and this is a major concern when you think about all the things that need to sit underneath a baby being born at a healthy birth weight. It is not good enough and I know everyone in this House agrees with that. And we do need to do things differently. That means listening to communities about the solutions that work best for them. Not what we think as politicians. Not what bureaucrats think. But what actually communities are saying. The Closing the Gap implementation plan launched last month is a practical way forward. It lays out a plan for us to achieve the targets and priority reforms set out in the national agreement. It includes more than $400m for additional spending by this government, safe and reliable water supply, better buildings in remote housing, improving food security, and of course boosting family violence and legal service providers that I know the Leader of the opposition is most concerned about. One bright spark is the Northern Territory police have advised that the violence-related activities has fallen by 30%, and so has domestic violence since the implementation of the alcohol restrictions in the Northern Territory. The government’s voice referendum working group has met again today, with the Greens’ Adam Bandt and Dorinda Cox joining the meeting. The expert group advising the government on the voice to parliament referendum is due to present its final advice on the constitutional alteration and the referendum question next week, so this week’s meeting is a bit of a precursor ahead of the main event. Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney issued a communique after the meeting, which also included herself, attorney general Mark Dreyfus, special envoy for reconciliation Pat Dodson, and foreign minister Penny Wong (representing PM Anthony Albanese, who is of course in India). The communique says the working group “progressed its discussions about the wording of the change to the constitution and the question on the ballot paper.” There has been some minor disagreement about whether the voice should have the power to advise the executive government, as well as the parliament. Burney’s office confirmed the government would introduce the constitution alteration bill to parliament in the coming sitting fortnight at the end of March, which will be followed by a parliamentary inquiry. Working group members described the meeting with Bandt and Cox as “positive” and that they had expressed “solid support” for the referendum. Back to the Stephen Jones hour, Paul Fletcher wants to know: Can the Minister explain to the house whether the capital gains tax discount ordinarily applicable for assets held within superannuation is available for either realised or unrealised gains under the Government’s new super tax? Jones: I thank the Leader of Opposition business in the house for the question. Of course, as all honourable members and particularly the member for Forde would know, as I non-licensed financial advisor, I can’t give financial advice either... Here or anywhere else. Peter Dutton pretends to have a point of order I have been here 22 years, I thought I had heard it all. Milton Dick says no point of order. Jones: As I was saying, I was invited to give financial advice. But what I can say, in the general, Mr Speaker, is the capital gains discount is available when there is a capital gains tax event. Sydney commuters – you should be able to get home. This is from Sydney Trains: A normal timetabled service operated this morning on the Sydney Trains network with only minor disruptions across the network following yesterday’s delays. Today’s afternoon and evening services will also operate to a normal timetable. The investigation into the root cause of yesterday’s Digital Train Radio System (DTRS) failure identified the failure of router equipment not operating correctly. The equipment has been replaced and the system is operating. Sydney Trains is raising this in discussion with our suppliers. The DTRS is a vital safety feature for the network which is the primary communication tool between the Rail Operations Centre and train crew on the network to alert them of any unexpected issues and emergencies. Sydney Trains again apologises to our customers for the delays experienced and thanks everybody for their understanding as staff worked to get people home safely. Katter mystifies; Marles applauds him Bob Katter has the last crossbench question and I wish I could tell you what it is about. I think most of the chamber wishes they knew what it was about. As always, it is a journey, delivered in the cadence of a bedtime story from your great-grandpa who returned from the war after decades lost in the jungle. Something about development of regional Australia I think. Richard Marles thanks Katter and says: Can I spotlight his extraordinary achievement? And in doing so acknowledge his advocacy - a little shameless - and acknowledge his advocacy on behalf of his electorate but more significantly on behalf of regional Australia. It’s important that is done because the story of our nation is not just written in Brisbane and Sydney and Melbourne. It is written in places like Mount Isa and Rockhampton, Newcastle and indeed in Geelong. And as an inhabitant of regional Australia, I understand how important it is that we are doing everything we can to provide opportunities for people to make their lives and to raise their families in regional Australia. That’s at the heart of what you are describing in your question. There is huge opportunities that I know the honourable member is describing in terms of his own electorate, where that development can occur. I want to say to him on behalf of the Albanese government regional Australia is front and centre in how we see the development of our nation. And we will continue to engage with him on this. As to the question of the budget, you’ll have to wait until the second Tuesday in May and the words of the treasurer about what is ultimately committed there but I can absolutely say that the Treasurer, the prime minister, myself will continue to work with you, to make sure that we are delivering the development and the benefits in regional Australia that you are such a keen advocate for. Marles says power prices would’ve gone up ‘a lot more’ if Coalition had their way The shadow energy minister, Ted O’Brien, who has become a favourite of Chris Bowen after he went to Japan and posted a ‘what we can learn about nuclear power’ video, has a question for Richard Marles: Will electricity prices go up by 20% over winter? Marles: Whatever happens with electricity prices in the future, they would have gone up a lot more if those opposite had their way last December. Because last December those opposite were given an opportunity to vote on behalf of the household budgets of the Australian people, by supporting a $1.5bn package which is working. If you look at the forward electricity prices, as they were announced in February, they are half what they were in November. Those opposite are the ones who stand to increase electricity prices. There are a million interjections. The point is that power prices were always going to still increase, they just weren’t going to increase by as much. You know what Marles does have the power to do though? Stop question time. Chris Bowen dives into ‘key points’ on safeguard mechanism The independent MP for North Sydney Kylea Tink has a question: This week New South Wales is again being besieged by bushfires while the Northern Territory and Queensland have had serious flooding. Daniel went on climate action requires us to rapidly reduce gross emissions. The safeguard mechanism in its current form does not guarantee this. Minister, what would you say to the people of North Sydney who say this legislation allow Australia’s biggest polluters to buy their way out of responsibility by purchasing unlimited carbon credits? Chris Bowen: I thank the member for her question and the engagement she has had with me today on the safeguard mechanism and the reforms. The first thing I would say to the honourable member is that the most important thing we can do as a parliament in coming weeks, to ensure on-site abatement in the facilities covered is to pass the bill, because the safeguard crediting bill actually provides a huge incentive for facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism to reduce their emissions. Because if they reduce their emissions by more than the baseline, they get a credit that they can use in future years or sell. That means that there is an incentive for them to invest in technology to reduce their own emissions. (This is the ‘it is better than nothing, we need a mechanism’ argument Labor have been using.) Bowen: The honourable members opposite used to believe that. This side of the house still believes that. That is the first thing we can do to encourage on-site abatement. The second point I make more broadly is that the safeguard reforms put these facilities on a very important pathway to net zero, and provides an ongoing incentive for them to invest in abatement. It is important for them to have flexibility in how they do so because we are requiring a 4.9% reduction each year, and different facilities were technologies available to them at different times. The 215 facilities cover a wide range of industries, airlines, aluminium smelters, fossil fuel expansion.and many others. (This is the ‘we have to start somewhere’ argument Labor have been using) Bowen: I understand the intention by the question, but these are the key points. In the final point I would make is the government last year commissioned the Chubb review of Australian carbon credits to ensure their integrity after questions are raised. Not everybody loves everything in the review, but the review conducted by the former Chief Scientist of Australia supported by the honourable Doctor Annabel Bennett, a KC, and they have done a very exhausting review and recommended changes which even the critics acknowledged would be world ‘s best practice governors going forward to ensure the integrity. I do not accept that carbon credits are some form of lesser abatement. I do agree we need a focus on on-site abatement, but whether it is Indigenous savanna burning on the other methods, there are real and very important project supported by Australian carbon credit units. They will be supported even more by the rigorous safeguard mechanism that I will be putting deal for the house and in the regulation and in the Senate, and I welcome the support of all members for these important measures and I remain available to honourable members who wish to discuss improvement in good faith. (This is ‘the science says we have to do something and this is what we think we can do’ argument) Dutton gets in on the Stephen Jones party It’s back to the Stephen Jones hour and Peter Dutton wants to know: Can the minister identified any act of parliament that currently has a provision to impose a tax on unrealised gains? Jones (after so many interjections that Voltron* would have had time to form, break up and reform using the long space sequence) This is a new reform. We are doing things in a different way. I am asked by the honorable member if there is to … If there is another part of the taxation law where unrealised capital gains are taxed. Yes, there is. Corporations tax. Yay for staffers running with answers. *Voltron was the Power Rangers before the Power Rangers, which I just learned is up to its 30th season. Jones asked about superannuation losses and tax refunds Ross Vasta, the LNP MP for Bonner, has a question for … Stephen Jones! My question is to the assistant treasurer and concerns the government’s new super tax. If an Australian who owns an asset through his or her superannuation fund receives a tax bill buzz of an unrealised gain in one year, but this asset is subsequently revalued resulting in a loss, will that Australian be eligible for a refund of the tax paid? Jones: I thank the honourable member for his question. It’s a good question. And it’s why when we have announced the policy to ensure that we can maintain the integrity of superannuation and superannuation tax concessions, which are costing the budget in excess of $50bn a year, more than we spend on Medicare, more than we spend on the NDIS, significant budget expenditure. It’s why when we announced this policy, we put in place a lengthy period for the implementation on it and a lengthy period to ensure that we can consult on some of these details, including details which go to the question that the honourable member has asked about the capacity to bring losses forward or backwards. We will consult on the specific design implementation of these issues, as any government would and indeed as the previous government did when they introduced the $6bn worth of taxation changes to the superannuation system. That is 155 words to say “we don’t know” but also, that is something that you wouldn’t expect to be known just yet either – the policy, which has no legislation as yet also doesn’t come into effect until 1 July 2025, AFTER the next election. Liberals have ‘laser-like focus on the interests of multimillionaires’: Jones Back to the Stephen Jones experience, and LNP MP Michelle Landry wants to know: My question is to the assistant treasurer and concerns the government’s new super tax. Can the minister advise the House of how many primary producers and small and family businesses have been identified in treasury modelling as being impacted by the government’s new super tax? Jones: Just for context in answering this question, the average superannuation balance for a retiree today is $150,000. $150,000. For women, around about $130,000 to $140,000. For men, around about $180,000. I’ve got to say in this debate, I’m enjoying the focus on superannuation, I’ve got to say. But I’ve got to say from the party which aspires to be the representatives of working people, they have a laser-like focus on the interests of multimillionaires. A laser-like focus on the interests of multimillionaires. Not one, not two, but three questions in a row focused on the interests of a half of 1% of Australians. Landry wants to know about relevance. Jones: I’m asked about the impact, Mr Speaker, of the government’s very reasonable … Superannuation proposals which are supported by over 65% of Australians. Including the majority of Liberal party voters and many on the other side. If you want to know what the impact is, it’s about a half of 1% of Australians and about a half of 1% of Australians and, yes, of course, given that this won’t come into effect for another two years, we will engage in a meaningful consultation, including with the farming sector, to ensure that any unintended consequences, including the type that the member for Capricornia is eluding to and the member, the other members have eluded to, we’ll engage in meaningful consultation with all of these groups to ensure the unintended consequences are not falling upon them. But let’s be very, very clear – when you’ve got a trillion dollars worth of debt, you can’t twiddle your thumbs. We won’t be twiddling our thumbs. There are a whole bunch of interjections, because it is very important that millionaires know how much the Coalition is backing them in, but the parliament moves on. The Australian government and the opposition have joined together to assure partners in south-east Asia and the Pacific that the soon-to-be-announced Aukus nuclear-powered submarine plan aims to safeguard “the peace and the stability of our region”. The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, did not confirm the details that have been leaked in the US and the UK – such as the acquisition of up to five US Virginia class submarines as a stopgap to British designed submarines – saying the announcement would be made “very shortly”. (It’s due to be made in San Diego on Monday, US time.) Marles acknowledged that the 18-month process with the US and the UK started under the former government. He specifically mentioned former PM Scott Morrison and former defence minister Peter Dutton “because this is a moment that we want to be – and we know is – a bipartisan moment of huge significance to our country”. Marles told parliament: It is difficult to overstate the step that, as a nation, we are about to take. Australia will become just of the seventh country to have the ability to operate a nuclear powered submarine. We have never operated a military capability at this level before. This will be a massive industrial endeavour, which will see thousands of jobs created over the coming decades, but much more importantly, will contribute to the technological advancement of our wider economy. Clearly, these submarines will have the capability to operate at war, but the true intent of this capability is to provide for the stability and for the peace of our region – for the Pacific, for South-east Asia, for the Indian Ocean, for the broader Indo-Pacific region – because the defence of Australia doesn’t really mean that much unless we can have collective security. As a trading island nation, any adversary can do a whole lot of harm to Australia without even setting foot on our shores, which means a nation we are deeply invested in the global rules-based order which has underpinned the stability of prosperity, the incredible economic growth of east Asia. So the totality of our strategic intent is to defend rules-based order. So I want to say at this moment to our neighbours and to our friends around the world that as Australia invests in its defence, as we acquire this nuclear-powered submarine capability, we do so as part of making our contribution to the peace and the stability of our region and of well. Dutton, now the opposition leader, added that he wanted to pay tribute to Morrison “without whom Aukus would not have been a reality”. Dutton said the decision to approach the UK in the first instance and through the UK to the US “was the vision of prime minister Morrison, and I pay tribute to him”. Dutton added: And as the acting prime minister and the minister for defence rightly point out, our neighbours should hear the very clear message that this is about providing peace and stability for our future and for theirs. Australia is a friend and partner and a valued friend and partner to people within our region and across our partnerships, including the Quad, including our Five Eyes partners, and that will always be the case. We are not an aggressive nation. We are a nation that strives for peace. Dutton, who was rebuked by the British high commissioner to Australia earlier this week for warning against a yet-to-be-developed British design, said the Australian people could see “the two major parties in this country working together in the nation’s best interests”. He pledged bipartisan support (while leaving room for raising concern about timeframes): We will support the decisions of the government under Aukus and fight to make sure the outcome is achieved as quickly as possible. Greens take aim at stage-three tax cuts but Marles says ‘position hasn’t changed’ Stephen Bates, the Greens MP for Brisbane who won the election but then had to go work his retail shift so he could pay his rent (which is part of the generational change we are seeing in younger politicians, not just here, but globally), asks Richard Marles about the stage-three tax cuts: Confronted by rising inequality and the cost of living crisis the government has made a welcome shift on [superannuation] tax breaks for super wealthy. Will you change the tax three tax cuts that also disproportionately benefit the super wealthy? Marles: As he knows and … I think everybody in here knows our position on that hasn’t changed. Ed Husic continues national reconstruction fund victory lap The industry minister gets a dixer on the topic, where he again calls the Coalition the “No-alition”, something started by Jim Chalmers or Anthony Albanese but really most likely someone in the tactics team who gets paid a lot of money to come up with silly little names for political opponents. Milton Dick says no and orders the opposition be called by their correct name. Husic doesn’t even pretend to be contrite. Stephen Jones prodded again on super changes It is back to the Stephen Jones prodding session. David Littleproud wants to know: If a family farm business asset is held in a self-managed super fund as part of their diverse portfolio … could increases in asset value during their financial year see that family pay additional tax … under the government’s superannuation changes? Jones: Yes, it is true that there are going to be a very small number of individuals, funds who will be paying more money under this arrangement. Yes, there is. We wouldn’t be doing it otherwise, and the object of the change is to ensure, on the one hand, that we maintain the integrity of our superannuation system, and on the other hand we also make a contribution to the debt that those opposite have left us. Now, in relation to any self-managed superannuation fund, that has assets in excess of $3m, the earnings on those assets under $3m will continue to attract the concessional tax rate of 15%. The earnings on the assets above $3m will still attract a very concessional tax rate, but not as generous as before the change. There are a lot of interjections, as you would expect. Jones gets back to it: That is the point. And I am asked about cashflow. These are very simple concepts. … It is still concessional. The reason that we are doing it is to ensure the integrity of the superannuation system, and to plug the $1tn worth of debt. There are more interjections and what looks like a point of order coming, but Jones completes his answer. Everyone loves submarines, nuclear and otherwise. Daniel Hurst will bring you the new information on this (which comes after Anthony Albanese confirmed what everyone knew but had to pretend like they couldn’t say – that there will be an Aukus announcement in San Diego next week) Moving on. Assistant treasurer targeted by Coalition to explain super changes Just a few weeks ago, the Coalition identified Julie Collins as a potential weak link in explaining government policy – you may remember the number of questions she received each session. This time round, it is assistant treasurer Stephen Jones who is getting the weak link treatment. After not doing a particularly great job yesterday in explaining the super concessional changes and what is and isn’t part of them, he is being targeted again by the Coalition for another round. Looks like he has been pointed in the right direction from the beginning this time round – there is much less waffling. Asked about things like the family farm being held in super and whether or not that would be taxed at a higher rate under Labor’s changes, Jones says: Indeed, under section 52(b) of the legislation, trustees have existing obligations. They have obligations to have regard to the liquidity of assets within their fund, the diversity of assets within their fund, and the ability of the fund to discharge their obligations, including taxation obligations, Mr Speaker. I stand by the answer that I gave yesterday. Speaker. I stand by the answer that I gave yesterday. Which is what he was trying to say yesterday, but the message became a little muddled, opening the door for Coalition attacks. The chamber is filling – it is time for the last question time of the sitting. Franking credits, super tax concessions, energy prices – you could almost write these posts now. But alas, we shall wait for democracy to play out. Conservative senators try to have Covid vaccination status protected from discrimination Interesting times in the Senate (timeless statement). The Merry Band of Misfits of Matt Canavan, Alex Antic, Gerard Rennick and Ralph Babet have tried to have Covid vaccination status as a protected attribute under the Fair Work anti-discrimination provisions. This lovely mix of LNP outliers, what’s left of the Palmer United party and more often than not One Nation is always a good time in the Senate, but particularly when they seek to choose who should be protected from discrimination. It won’t shock you to learn that Malcolm Roberts was on board with this, but the Coalition as a whole, was not. That broad church just keeps getting broader. We are almost at question time. May Dolly have mercy on our souls. Albanese ‘very honoured’ by billboards of his face across India Apparently there are hundreds of billboards in India with Anthony Albanese’s face on them, celebrating his visit. Asked about it, Albanese says: It is hard to not have noticed them, yes. Certainly I’m very honoured – not for myself, for Australia. It says how valued the relationship with Australia is that the government of India and prime minister Modi have put such a major effort into making us feel so welcome. The prime minister is asked about the Virginia Class submarine report coming out of the US. Anthony Albanese says: I’ll be making further comments about specific proposals at the appropriate time, but I can confirm that on Monday there will be a meeting of the Aukus partners, between myself, President Biden, and Prime Minister Sunak, in addition in the United States I will be having bilateral meetings with President Biden and Prime Minister Sunak. I look forward to announcing those details. They will be announced in the appropriate way on Monday, US time, in San Diego. Q: Will Australia retain sovereignty over the technology, if there is a disagreement over whether to use the tech in any future (hypothetical) conflict? Albanese: Australia will retain absolutely our sovereignty, our absolute sovereignty, 100%. It is very important that Australia as a sovereign nation state – and that’s something that’s respected by all of our partners as well. He finishes with: I will be making comments at the appropriate time when we’ve made the announcements. This is a joint arrangement between Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. We’re great friends. We have over a century of standing side by side during peacetime and during conflict, and I look forward to the announcements next week. India visit about clean energy, trade and defence, Albanese says Trade missions are always a little alien – lots of speeches, lots of looking at business and awkward question and answers and lots of standing around. Anthony Albanese has just completed one of those awkward moments at a smart energy company and is now speaking to the travelling media outside: Towards the end of this year I’m looking forward to an upgrade in the economic relationship between Australia and India, and I’ll be having discussions with prime minister Modi about that today. Already this morning, I’ve met with 34 smart energy companies who are here from Australia, providing significant investment, seizing the opportunity that is there. One of the things that we discussed was the fact that there’s a lot of investment ready as well in Australia to build solar panels in Australia. And I’m very pleased that the National Reconstruction Fund legislation passed the House of Representatives a short time ago. They’re the sort of measures that we need in place, measures that drive our economy towards clean energy, measures that then take advantage of cleaner, cheaper energy to make more things in Australia. And that is why we also want to then train Australians for those jobs through fee-free TAFE, through 20,000 additional university places, through 10,000 – $10,000 new energy apprenticeships that we’ve announced as well. This is a coherent economic plan for Australia’s economic future. That is very important. And the third element of the visit is, of course, defence and security. And I will be boarding the first-ever significant naval ship built here in India in Mumbai later today. We will be hosting the Malabar operations in Australia for the first time later this year and talking about our security in the Indo-Pacific is an important focus of our relationship. These are all important. Albanese says deepening relationship with India is a ‘win-win’ Anthony Albanese spoke a little bit ago at Ahmedabad in India. He says strengthening the relationship with India is “win-win”, particularly when it comes to renewable energy. Australia has a role in engaging with India as well as with other countries in our region. But it also makes good economic sense. It’s about Australian jobs and about Australian businesses growing. It is, indeed, smart economics not just smart energy. ‘A more formal announcement’ coming on Aukus: Husic Ed Husic was also asked whether he was unimpressed with leaks out of the US and the UK surrounding the Aukus announcement due early next week – and about whether there will be enough work for Australian industry. The minister for industry and science said: I would just say that again at the appropriate point the deputy prime minister and defence minister will make a more formal announcement about what we do and I’ll leave it at that. Minister refuses to be drawn on Aukus The minister for industry and science, Ed Husic, has refused to be drawn on the looming Aukus announcement – including how important it would be to plug the capability gap and whether he could confirm Australia would purchase up to 5 Virginia class submarines from the US. Husic told reporters in the blue room that he admired the “deft way” in which the question was asked, but added: No career limiting moves by me, if you don’t mind. He pivoted to the topic of the day - the National Reconstruction Fund - saying it would be able to support the evolution of important capabilities expected by strategic partners, including quantum technologies. Labor criticised over ‘enhanced income management’ Labor “abolished” the cashless welfare card (the Basics card was never changed). Or did it. The “enhanced income management smart card” which is in its place, seems pretty much the same, at least according to the shadow minister, Anne Rushton. Indue still runs the scheme. Antipoverty Centre spokesperson and welfare recipient Kristin O’Connell has also criticised amendments Labor has introduced into the parliament, particularly with these sections: Item 36 amends paragraph 123SF(3)(b) to extend the eligibility criteria for individuals who seek to volunteer for the enhanced IM regime to usually reside within a ‘voluntary enhanced income management area (see item 38 for this term). Item 38 inserts new subsection 123SF(5) to allow the Minister to determine, by legislative instrument, that a specified State, Territory or area is a voluntary enhanced IM area for the purpose of Part 3AA. Item 40 amends subparagraph 123SG(1)(a)(ii) to extend the eligibility criteria for individuals who seek to volunteer for the enhanced IM regime to usually reside within a ‘voluntary enhanced income management area.’ The Minister may specify these areas by legislative instrument made under subsection 123SF(5) (see item 38 above). The Minister intends to specify only existing voluntary IM areas at this time. O’Connell: Without warning, Labor has today introduced a bill to dramatically expand the minister’s discretion. And now they want the minister to be able to roll it out wherever she likes, and whenever she likes. They are inviting the next Coalition government to force income control on every welfare recipient in the country when they inevitably return to power. The deception is sickening. We condemn this decision and urge the government to change course. Please, recommit to ensuring no one can be forced to be on cashless welfare. Adam Bandt on Lidia Thorpe’s claims Adam Bandt has also shrugged off claims from former Greens senator Lidia Thorpe that the party’s lawyers advised her to say she dated former motorcycle gang member Dean Martin, which she now says was not true. A Senate privileges committee report into “possible obstruction” of the law enforcement committee – of which Thorpe was once a member – found this week she should have declared her links to Martin. But it found that the former Greens senator did not disclose any of the committee’s sensitive activities and that she should not be found in contempt. Thorpe claimed to Guardian Australia, and then later in the Senate, that she did not date Martin, despite telling the Senate committee last year in writing that they did date. I got ridiculed for something that I didn’t do. I was advised by lawyers to say that I was dating that person … I got advice from the Greens lawyers saying, ‘You have to say that you dated’. Greens sources strongly denied this was the case. Bandt declined to comment specifically, calling the privileges committee “very important”, but said he didn’t agree with Thorpe’s claims. [The privileges committee] has received submissions and statements ... I’m not going to comment on any statements about those findings or statements about statements made to the committee. I disagree with much of what was in Senator Thorpe’s statement but I’m not going to run a commentary about matters to do with the very important privileges committee. End to pre-departure Covid testing procedure for passengers from China, Hong Kong and Macau Australia has had the measures in place since 5 January, after China halted a lot of its own Covid protocols. Australia’s testing order will stop from 12.01am 11 March. From the Mark Butler release: The Australian government has been monitoring the situation in China and reviewing epidemiological data as it becomes available. Reports show the number of Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths peaked in late December 2022/early January 2023. China has been regularly providing data to the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data and to date there has been no reports of new variants of concern. Several other countries that implemented similar measures have recently either repealed their arrangements or announced an intention to repeal them, including the United States, Korea, Japan, France and Italy. Since the measure was introduced, the government has strengthened Australia’s capacity to detect and respond to emerging variants of concern of international origin – including extending community wastewater testing. National Australia Bank is the first of the major banks to lift its home loan rate, passing on the Reserve Bank’s latest official rate rise to customers in full. NAB has increased its standard variable home loan by 0.25 percentage points, with the mortgage rate increase to come into effect at the end of next week. It also increased the rate on some of its savings and deposits accounts. Australia’s central bank increased the official cash rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.6% on Tuesday, marking a record 10 consecutive run of hikes. The policy is designed to stifle spending and get inflation under control, but is also heaping pressure on households enduring high prices for everything from food to electricity. NAB is the first major bank to announce rate changes after the competition regulator announced last month it would investigate how banks set interest rates for savers, including the differential between bank deposit and home loan rates. Concerns over pricing have re-emerged after the country’s biggest lenders recently posted bumper profits by increasing rates on their loans at a faster pace than on their deposits over the past several months. Industry minister Ed Husic was going to be holding his national reconstruction fund success press conference in the Mural Hall, but he has since upgraded to the Blue Room. Fancy. Adam Bandt on voice: ‘There needs to be a clear message put to people’ Greens leader Adam Bandt says he hopes the voice to parliament referendum is successful, but has also backed concerns from senator Dorinda Cox about the level of detail needed to be released publicly to ensure the vote gets up. The Greens will meet the government’s referendum working group today. Cox, the party’s new spokesperson on Indigenous affairs, told the Nine newspapers that the government “needs to communicate what the referendum is all about more effectively”. Asked at a press conference, Bandt backed her comments: Senator Cox was making the point that there needs to be a clear message put to people about why this is important. We have a very clear position on that, this is a step toward First Nations justice. Bandt said there were “other things” the Greens would also push for in the Indigenous affairs space, referencing the party’s focus on the truth and treaty elements of the Uluru statement from the heart, but that he wanted the vote to win. We need a clear understanding about why this is important, because we want this referendum to succeed. Bandt said the Greens would seek info from the group on the exact referendum question to be put. He also wanted the Referendum Machinery amendments to pass - the Greens have “concerns” about some parts, including fact-checking on the official pamphlet, but those are still TBA. Happy Birthday to us!! In non political news, the Guardian is turning 10 this year. And we are celebrating the double digits with a few little surprises we will be able to tell you more about soon. Like me, the Guardian is a Gemini, so you’ll have to wait until late May – but we were hoping to bring you into the celebrations a little earlier, so if you would like to be part of the video special marking the occasion, send an email to guardian.australia.video@theguardian.com with the subject line HAPPY BIRTHDAY and we will send you instructions. I will leave it up to you to decide how many exclamation marks to put with that. Tanya Plibersek on cost-of-living relief Your regular reminder that indexation of welfare payments is not the same as actually raising the rate. It is an automatic process that occurs under regulation and who is in government has no bearing on that process, other than they don’t stop it. Which rarely, if at all happens. On another note, Tanya Plibersek was asked about cost of living relief while speaking to Laura Jayes on Sky News this morning: We’ve supported pay increases, we’ve obviously supported the largest increase in welfare benefits, indexation of pensions and other payments – the largest in twelve years. We’ve reduced the cost of medicines. Childcare costs will go down dramatically for about 1.2 million families. We know that the cost of living is a real problem for Australian families and that’s why we’re focussing on this sort of relief that really does help family budgets. Of course, our energy package was designed to bring down energy prices, which are also a big impost on family budgets. We’ve also got to repair the structural problems in the economy. We know, for example, that we’ve got skill shortages right across the country and that’s contributing to inflation. That’s the problem that the Reserve Bank’s trying to fix. So we’ve got to get into that economic reform area as well. And of course, when we have had bigger than expected receipts in the budget, we’ve put that towards actually repairing the budget as well. We were left with close to a trillion dollars of debt. Australian taxpayers are paying interest on close to a trillion dollars of debt from the previous government. Unless we begin to tackle that, the structural problems in the economy will continue to see the inflation problems that we’ve got. As we noted yesterday, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe reckoned falling housing values were contributing to weaker demand, and hence taking some of the heat out of the economy. In the December quarter, household consumption increased by just 0.3%, which, in per capita terms, represents a small decline … the combination of cost-of-living pressures, higher interest rates and the decline in housing values is weighing on consumption. Data out today from CoreLogic, a data firm, shows that its rolling 28-day tally of home values suggests that “decline” has plateaued lately: To be sure, homeowners in most parts of the country have seen property prices fall over the past year. According to CoreLogic, the 7.9% slide over the past 12 months is the largest on record. Sydney leads the falls, with values down 13.4% from a year earlier (and are 13.5% below their record high). Melbourne’s 9.6% drop from a year ago is also how much they’ve fallen from the record. Hobart’s values are off 11.8% in the past year, and a similar 12.1% retreat from the city’s record. Perth’s prices, meanwhile, are up 2.4% over the past year and are just 0.9% below their record. Darwin’s are on the rise too, with prices up 2.9% over the past year but remaining 11.5% below the city’s record set almost nine years ago. So that readers in other cities don’t feel left out: Brisbane’s values are down 6.8% in the past year (and are 11% off their highs); Adelaide’s prices are up 5.1% (to be 2.3% below their record); Canberra’s values are off 6.7% (and are down 9% from their peak). We’ll have to see whether hints at a pause in rate rises from Lowe (perhaps after one more hike in April) encourage buyers back into the property markets. Global debt ratings agency Moody’s, meanwhile, has forecast housing affordability will remain poor over this year, with Sydney the worst. In February, new home loan borrowers needed an average 30.9% of monthly income to meet monthly mortgage repayments, up from 26.4% in May 2022, when interest rates began to increase, the agency says. “We expect that ongoing housing price declines will broadly balance out further interest rate rises in terms of their effect on housing affordability this year,” it says. “If the RBA raises the cash rate to 4.1%, the share of income that borrowers need to meet repayments on new mortgages will hold around the February level if housing prices decline 4.5%.” Sydney was the least affordable city, with new borrowers needing 40.7% of household income to meet mortgage repayments in February, compared with Hobart (33.9%), Melbourne (34.5%), Adelaide (31.1%), Brisbane (27.9%), and Perth (19.3%), Moody’s said. (Sorry, Canberrans, no number for you) Fare-free day for Sydney commuters Sydney commuters will receive a free travel day some time after the election in a fortnight following the major network disruption yesterday. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, on Thursday apologised to voters for the shutdown that he says was believed to be the result of an IT system issue. He said: These challenges occur from time to time. What’s most important is when they happen they get fixed immediately. I’ve been assured by the secretary of the Department of Transport that this won’t happen again. I’ve made it very clear to the secretary, the department, that my expectation is that there is a fare-free day to make up some way for what occurred yesterday. He said there was no indication there was a cyber-attack on the network. Sussan Ley on reconstruction fund deal: ‘We will fight Labor’s recklessness all the way to the Senate, then to the election and beyond’ Liberal deputy leader Sussan Ley has responded to the news the national reconstruction fund will pass (the Coalition is voting no): Australian households and small businesses face soaring energy bills and Labor seem determined to make it worse with Anthony Albanese caving to the Greens and selling Australian manufacturing up the creek. Every expert in the country is calling on the prime minister to unlock more supply of gas, but today’s awful deal with the Greens is another demonstration that this government is utterly unable to deliver policies that would bring affordable and reliable energy. The industry minister always claims to acknowledge the importance of gas as a transition fuel but today he is preventing investment in this critical area of our sovereign manufacturing policy. This is a bad bill that has become even worse. We will fight Labor’s recklessness all the way to the Senate, then to the election and beyond. The resources industry is the only industry singled out for prohibition in this fund, a damning indictment on the priorities of this bad Labor government. And for more information on the wheeling and dealing that led to the national reconstruction fund getting the numbers it needed in the Senate, here is Paul Karp: Ed Husic on the reconstruction fund: ‘one of the largest peacetime investments in manufacturing this country has ever seen’ The industry minister is very happy to have struck a deal on the national reconstruction fund legislation with the Greens: After a decade of neglect from the former Liberal-National government, the Albanese government is revitalising Australian manufacturing. By voting against the National Reconstruction Fund, the Liberal and National parties have once again shown they are not on the side of Australian manufacturers and only care about manufacturing when it comes to a photo opportunity. We are now one step closer to delivering one of the largest peacetime investments in manufacturing this country has ever seen. The Greens will hold a press conference about the amendment they secured very soon. The About the House twitter account – which updates you on the business of the chamber – has embraced emojis. The cupcakes do not make up for the cringe memes. I’d take raising the jobseeker rate over 1m cupcakes though. And it always pays to read the terms and conditions The Greens will introduce a bill to repeal the Regional Forest Agreements Act which grants logging operations an exemption from national environmental laws. The party’s forests spokesperson, senator Janet Rice, will introduce the bill in the Senate today. In addition to repealing the Regional Forest Agreements Act, the bill proposes the tabling of an annual statement from the threatened species commissioner on how logging is affecting Australia’s progress towards the government’s zero extinctions target. It proposes a second statement be tabled by the environment minster outlining how logging is affecting Australia’s progress towards its commitment to protect 30% of the country’s land areas by 2030. Rice said federal and state governments had failed to meet their responsibility to protect the environment and fix failing environmental laws. She said logging operations covered by regional forest agreements had been granted an exemption from national environmental laws for too long. The Regional Forest Agreements have allowed for decades of reckless destruction of native forests across Australia, pushed native wildlife to the brink of extinction, endangered our water supplies, heightened bushfire risk, and made the climate crisis worse. If passed, this bill will end the destructive logging of Australia’s precious native forests, by repealing the Regional Forest Agreements and closing the loopholes used by the logging industry to skirt our national environment laws. The Albanese government has proposed introducing legislation to reform Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act later this year. ‘No indication so far’ cyber-attack caused Sydney rail shutdown Sydney transport bosses say there is no evidence at this stage to suggest the hour-long shutdown of the city’s rail network was related to a possible cyber-attack. During the shutdown, which saw tens of thousands of commuters stranded during peak hour on Wednesday, the transport minister, David Elliott, said that while it was likely a “glitch” in the network, he was waiting for briefings on the possibility it was due to “foreign interference or industrial sabotage”. But on Thursday the head of Sydney Trains, Matt Longland, said during a press conference that “based on the detailed review overnight” the delays were caused by a failure in a piece of technology and “wasn’t related to any suspected issue in terms of any cyber activity or any anything of that nature”. The NSW government is currently in caretaker mode in the lead-up to the state election on 25 March, and during a press briefing the chief operating officer for Transport for NSW, Howard Collins, said he had contact with Elliott and his office within minutes of the fault being discovered. Asked whether the possibility of foul play was raised during those discussions, Collins said: There is always a concern with any IT systems or even these OT systems, which are an enclosed system, is there any foreign interference or any other issue coming in to the network?” I think so far, and it’s important to say so far, we haven’t concluded the final investigation, but so far this is leading to a component failure, or a failure of overloading the system with software. We will get to the bottom of it. But no indication so far indicates this is something coming into the network like a cyber attack or data which is coming in from outside our system.” The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, is also a senator for the ACT. So if the ACT doesn’t want new coal and gas projects (as the Australia Institute polling Paul reported on has found) doesn’t that affect her too? Gallagher told the ABC: It [the findings] doesn’t surprise me. I mean, the ACT has been leading the way in terms of adoption of renewable energy targets, including when I was chief minister … we rely on 100% renewable energy now in our jurisdiction because of policies that were put in place 10 or 15 years ago, so that that doesn’t surprise me and I understand the issue more broadly, people do want to see the shift to renewable energy generation. I guess the argument we’re having is, you know, the pathway to get there and the transition to get there. That doesn’t just affect people in the ACT, it affects the entire country, and the country … is very different, as we know. But the safeguard mechanism is … a real opportunity to make huge progress forward in reducing our emissions in a way where we can all work together and so I am really hopeful that we don’t get to a situation where we have a stalemate in the Senate on this – like that we can’t make something that doesn’t please everyone to 100% – [a] stall in the face of the progress that we know we need to make. So we’re just going to continue to talk with Senator Pocock and others to get this through the Senate because it’s essential if we’re going to make the first and important steps to reducing emissions from our biggest polluters. GetUp calls for referendum machinery changes to fight voter suppression of First Nations youth GetUp’s CEO, Larissa Baldwin-Roberts, says the government needs to ensure an amendment to the referendum machinery legislation (which sets up how the referendum will be held) that will ensure all voting age First Nations people can cast their vote needs to pass. Baldwin-Roberts, a Widjabul Wia-bal woman, said further disenfranchisement from the voting process will only hurt the referendum’s success: For over a decade we’ve been fighting voter suppression in First Nations communities. Voters have been purged from the electoral roll and years of Coalition-led funding cuts has meant enrolment rates and access to voting has dropped. The provisional voting amendment to the referendum bill will undo years of suppression and ensure that thousands of First Nations people will have access to voting in this referendum. It will mean that people in remote communities have access to enrol on election day. We saw how similar reforms in the Northern Territory elections increased voter turnout. The referendum has to uphold the best of our democratic process, without this costless measure we will continue to experience yet another form of voter suppression. This is something that communities and the AEC supports. This amendment would give thousands of First Nations people across the country the right to vote in a referendum that is all about our vision for our communities. We cannot have a referendum that directly impacts First Nations communities, without first ensuring every eligible First Nations person can vote on it. Immigration minister grants residency to migrant family who faced removal because of son’s medical condition Some welcome news in the case of the Aneesh family in Perth, who faced being removed from Australia because of their son’s medical condition. The ABC reported that the family of 10-year-old Aaryan, who lives with Down Syndrome, had failed Australia’s visa test, which considers the potential cost a migrant’s staying in Australia might have on the public health system. The system has been consistently criticised as discriminatory against people with disabilities. The family exhausted its appeals options, but, this week, the immigration minister. Andrew Giles, has personally intervened and said the family would be granted permanent residency. They told the ABC they were “overjoyed” at the minister’s decision. “We can stay here, we can live in this community, we can provide a very good environment for our kids,” Aaryan’s mother said. David Pocock, as one of the deciding votes in the senate when the Coalition says yeah, nah to voting to legislation is under a lot of pressure – not just from the negotiations himself, but his constituency in the ACT as Paul Karp reports: Want to know more about the safeguard mechanism deadlock? The audio team have you covered: Daniel Andrews rejects accusations of ‘retribution’ against state ICAC The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has rejected accusations that his government engaged in retribution in response to probes by the state’s anti-corruption watchdog. The Herald Sun reported on Thursday that the former head of the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission accused the Andrews government of retaliation in response to the agency’s probes into its conduct. The allegations are contained in a letter Robert Redlich sent to the parliament lower house speaker and upper house president in December. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Andrews said he had not seen the letter: I absolutely reject any suggestion by him or anybody else that the government does not behave appropriately. I’m not having a debate with a bloke who used to run an agency and he’s apparently written a letter that I haven’t seen. Redlich claims that government MPs directed independent auditors to “find dirt” on the watchdog that was not publicly available. University of Sydney strikes continue Hundreds of University of Sydney staff and students are striking for a seventh day today, marking the longest-running campaign of work stoppages at an Australian university. Picket lines have been formed blocking access to campus in protest of university management’s rejection of the National Tertiary Education Union’s claims on a new enterprise bargaining agreement. The agreement has been in negotiations since August 2021. In its latest offer, the university put forward a 4.6% pay increase in 2023 plus an additional $2,000 sign-on payment and a reduction in its casual workforce of 20%. The president of the University of Sydney’s NTEU branch, Dr Nick Rimer, said the institution was “seriously threatening” staff rights at work. University managers have been responsible for spiralling overwork and relentless inefficiencies. They’re badly distracting us from our key responsibilities of education and research. Union members are trying to fix that. They want us to believe they’re the incarnation of generosity, but they’re making a miserly salary offer that is lower than far less wealthy institutions like the Australian Catholic University or Western Sydney University. That’s simply unacceptable. The university posted a $1.04bn surplus in 2021, the highest of any institution. Classes and laboratory sessions have been widely cancelled ahead of the strikes, the student union’s food outlets will be closed, and administration work – including on grant applications and results processing – will not be going ahead. The union has flagged further industrial action in March and May if its claims are unmet. In an email sent to staff on 21 February, the deputy vice-chancellor, Annamarie Jagose, said it had been in an “unnecessarily protracted bargaining round” and it recognised “maintaining our sector-leading salaries is critical if we are to continue to attract and retain the best people”. Since August 2021, the university has made a number of significant concessions in relation to its offer. Now that we have almost reached the end of the more than 100 claims put by the unions, I am confident that we have made a sector-leading offer that many colleagues will be impatient to accept. Liberal senator James Paterson had found his niche in opposition, railing about TikTok. To be fair, this was also his interest while in government – but it’s a lot easier to point out what should be done when your side isn’t the one with the power for the doing. So none of these things are new – it’s just that the shackles have been released. Safeguard mechanism negotiations still deadlocked The negotiations for the safeguard mechanism are still deadlocked, though. The Greens and David Pocock (the key votes needed for it – Lidia Thorpe has said she will vote with the Greens on climate issues) are not convinced it will really make a material change. Labor says it’s the first step and having a mechanism is important. Every commentator and their cat is talking about 2009. It could pop up in the next sitting, but there is a lot of work to be done before then. Amy’s analysis: who gets what out of the national reconstruction fund negotiations? Labor has always said the point of the NRF was to boost manufacturing and wouldn’t be used for coal or gas – but now it is explicit. The Greens wanted the amendment to stop any future governments from using the fund for fossil fuels. That doesn’t mean a future government couldn’t try to amend the legislation in the future if it really wanted to, but it would need the parliament to agree and also would have to publicise “we want to use this for fossil fuels”. So Ed Husic gets his fund; the Greens, who had a manufacturing policy for the election, get the spirit of that policy and a fossil fuel ban; and the Coalition, who were against it – putting the Greens in the bargaining seat – get to say the government is making deals with the Greens (which is the point of a lot of this “just say no” policy). The government has got the votes it needs for the national reconstruction fund: the Greens are on board after the government agreed to an amendment which means the fund can’t be used for coal and gas projects or for native forest logging. Adam Bandt: Coal and gas are the biggest cause of the climate crisis, so this is a big win for the climate and a big win for jobs and the economy. Coal and gas are out of the reconstruction fund, and native forest logging is too. We thank the government for the constructive approach they have taken in the negotiations and hope this can continue in the safeguard and housing bill discussions in the coming period. Clean energy investment positive but ‘Australia needs to do more’ The Clean Energy Council says data shows positive signs for the energy transition – but we also need to act faster. Year-to-year investment saw a 17% bump on 2021, with $6.2bn in 2022. The final quarter of 2022 saw investment in financially committed large-scale generation and storage projects reach $4.3bn, the highest quarterly investment since Q3 2018. Six generation and storage projects reached financial close, representing 1923 MW of new installed capacity and 800 MWh of storage. The council’s chief executive, Kane Thornton, said investors were responding to the new policy environment but it wasn’t yet the trend. The fact remains that the rolling quarterly average investment over 12 months has not risen above $2bn since the second quarter of 2019. The current policy settings are only going to get us so far, and it’s clear that with significant shifts in capital overseas through the United States Inflation Reduction Act and other responses from the likes of the European Union and the Gulf States, Australia needs to do more. The organisation wants to see the renewable energy target increased to boost that investment Coalition argues desired funding changes for referendums are about integrity The Coalition hasn’t agreed to vote for the Referendum Machineries Act – the legislation which updates how we hold referendums in this country, given we haven’t held one this century. So far, the Coalition is drawing a hard line over the funding. The argument is that it is not just for this referendum, but future ones. Here is what Simon Birmingham had to say this morning: I think that we should have formal yes and no committees and that those committees, as I said last time, should have some administrative or operational funding attached to them. That’s what we’re asking for. I don’t want to see large licks of taxpayer funds spent on big advertising campaigns – that’s for different parties to go out and raise themselves. But it is reasonable to expect to see that there are formal campaigns there, to ensure that the debate on the voice is an informed, structured debate that is subjected to all the same types of rules and regulations that we would also see during a normal election campaign. That’s actually about the integrity and the proper process of it and I hope that the government will consider that and those reasonable requests as it passes through the Senate. The thing is though, the parliament can amend legislation whenever it has the will. So this one piece of legislation doesn’t have to cover every referendum in the future – if there is a need to change it for another referendum, that is easy enough. The parliament sitting is about to begin and the house will open with the second reading debate for the national reconstruction fund. That’s Ed Husic’s baby, so expect a lot of words from him about that today. Bill Shorten was going to hold a doorstop (mini press conference) to acknowledge one million downloads of the myGov app (the one with the cringe Valentine social media posts), complete with cupcakes, but that has been cancelled. So I guess you can’t let them eat cake, after all. Some Melbourne hospitals experiencing IT outage Melbourne hospitals across the Eastern Health network are experiencing a “significant” IT system outage this morning. A “code yellow internal emergency” has been declared across the healthcare service which offers emergency, surgical, medical and general healthcare services, including maternity, and palliative care. Eastern Health said the caused was “a critical core switch outage” with no evidence of a cyber attack. In a statement issued shortly before 8am, Eastern Health said they were working to resolve the issue: Hospital systems have reverted to downtime procedures and business continuity plans have been enacted. We will continue to keep our staff, patients and healthcare partners informed as the situation unfolds. And we again thank our staff for the work they are doing to support the ongoing care of our community. Labor not surprised by RBA’s current approach on interest rates A little earlier, Katy Gallagher danced the line between “the RBA is independent” and also “we are happy to hear there is a pause in interest rate rises coming”. She told ABC Radio RN Breakfast: We’re all … watching and listening when the governor speaks. I think, from what I saw of his address and question-and-answer session … he was indicating that they’re going to continue to look as the data comes in and they make their decisions accordingly. So I don’t think that’s necessarily a surprise but … it’s something … we’d want the bank to be doing, I would suggest, because you know, when they making decisions, obviously those decisions impact on on all of us. So I didn’t see anything hugely surprising – [the bank will] read the data, [look at the] evidence and then make decisions about interest rates based on those. Birmingham: PM should push to raise issues on Ukraine invasion not just for humanitarian reasons but also economic ones Does Simon Birmingham think that Anthony Albanese should be raising issues about freedom of speech and Russia while he is with the Indian leader? Birmingham: Well, a couple of things there. Australia should always be consistent and predictable when it comes to our values. We have clear values in our country that we uphold in terms of the nature of our democracy, the freedom of the media, and the types of values that people should expect us to uphold to express and to do so quite consistently with any nation in the world. Critically, of course, we do wish to see the G20 used as a platform to try to continue to put pressure on Russia to cease the war in Ukraine. And so I would expect those matters to form part of discussions to make sure that we are attempting to send as strong a message as possible about not just the human toll that that war is inflicting, but also the economic toll on Europe and around the world as a consequence of that. And that’s part of the reason why the G 20, founded for particular economic purposes, has a role to play in sending a strong message as it can send to Russia. Coalition takes credit for India-Australia relationship’s ‘high point’ Liberal senator [and probably the Coalition’s best communicator] Simon Birmingham is on ABC Radio RN Breakfast this morning. He is happy Anthony Albanese is meeting with Narendra Modi and says the former government helped set the relationship up for expansion: Well, they have been drawing closer and closer in recent years. Under the previous government, we signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement with India. We signed a new trade agreement with India just prior to Covid [I led, as] as then trade minister, the largest business delegation ever to India in terms of reaching across a whole range of sectors including, critically, the education sector that you just spoke of. And so I really welcome this mission by Prime Minister Albanese, he finds the India-Australia relationship at a high point and it’s an opportunity for him to drive that further in terms of our bilateral cooperation and critically, also building upon the areas of regional and global cooperation that we have also … strengthened so greatly in recent years through our partnership in the Quad and that are … at a key point this year within his chairmanship of the G20. And for a little more detail on what is about to be announced, our UK colleagues Kiran Stacey and Dan Sabbagh have this story: Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead, the head of the nuclear-powered submarine taskforce, had a chat with Daniel Hurst: Australia will put nuclear safety ‘above all else’ as it begins the ‘generational challenge’ of building and operating nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus pact, the government’s top adviser has said. Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead has moved to allay concerns – both at home and across the region – about nuclear safety as Australia, the US and the UK prepare to announce their detailed plans within days. The head of the Australian government’s nuclear-powered submarine taskforce has also insisted that the likely presence of American and British personnel on Australian boats would not inhibit Australian command and control. Gallagher aware of funding issue on national partnership agreements A lot of funding in Australia is tied up in national partnership agreements. They are usually for short periods – the commonwealth works with the states to come to an agreement on funding, but it often means that agreements almost come to an end (or indeed, do end) and need emergency funding to continue while the next national partnership is worked out. That’s what happening for a lot of homelessness charities at the moment. They say they are going to be have to sack people, because the funding is about to run out. Katy Gallagher says that she is not hand balling it to the states and she is aware of the issue, but the agreement process is being worked out: That agreement, which this money flows through is part of the national housing and homelessness agreement. And we are in active negotiations with the states. I’m aware of the funding issue. This is, you know, to give appropriate remuneration funding for or funding for payment for staff and Julie Collins is working hard on it. I can’t give you an answer today because it is right literally on our table. Labor ‘determined to be responsible in terms of budget’ Are Katy Gallagher and Jim Chalmers looking for savings with more urgency than they were in October, given the economic circumstances? Gallagher: We certainly were aware of the inflation problem in October. So you saw that we were we had upside, revenue coming in to the budget that we banked that – I think it was 99% in the first two years and 94% of the upside revenue over the forward estimates. Now that was an important message, not just from the fact that we’re going to be fiscally responsible, but that where we can, you know, show restraint in spending. We will and so we will continue that in the May budget where we [are in the processes right now] so I can’t go to decisions that might be taken in in the future around it but I can honestly I can absolutely say to you that Jim and I are determined to be responsible in terms of budget, we’ve got a massive job to do and that will require showing restraint because of this inflation pressure within the economy. We don’t want to make it worse. We’re conscious of the fact that our spending, you know if we’re not mindful of it, that it could have an impact. And so we’re not we’re not putting ourselves in that position. Finance minister: ‘whole range of booby traps’ left by former government in budget The finance minister Katy Gallagher is on ABC Radio RN Breakfast this morning, where she will no doubt be asked about the franking credit changes. The Liberal senator Simon Birmingham will be up after Gallagher, so no doubt he will have plenty of things to say in response. Gallagher is asked about whether the government is looking at “escalating” savings in the budget, given inflation. We are certainly looking at how we can institute some budget repair. I mean, we’ve inherited a budget with massive deficits. There’s a $50bn structural deficit that exists in the budget every year. And we’ve got this massive debt that we’ve inherited as well. So we have this responsibility to manage the debt. Look at how we repair the budget over time and I guess the other pressure we’ve got is that the you know, and we’ve talked about this a lot, is the pressures coming towards the budget are increasing, not decreasing. So that requires us to have a look at current expenditure, where it is what the priorities are, where the some of that can be reprioritised into these new and emerging pressures. But also, there are areas where we can make sensible savings and I’m not going to pretend it is easy, it is not easy. You know we’ve got a whole range of booby traps that were left by the former government for us that we’re working through now … these list of terminating pressures on programs that aren’t terminating for a start, which certainly dressed up how the budget balance looked over time, but [masked] the reality of the funding pressures that were being faced on that budget so we’re dealing with a whole range of things, terminating measures, increasing pressures and are [looking for savings]. Franking credit fight The Coalition is sinking its teeth into Labor’s 2023 Treasury amendment bill, as it has suggested changes to franking credit buyback schemes. It has been referred to the Senate economics committee and Andrew Bragg is leading the charge in that chamber, calling the amendment “a dangerous and underhanded measure to stop the payment of franked dividends in Australia”. The Labor Party wants to destroy franking, by barring Australian companies which have raised capital from paying franked dividends. That will be most companies. If this was Labor’s intention, they should have been honest with Australians during the election. Instead, we were given emphatic reassurances from the Prime Minister and Treasurer they would not touch franking credits. Now we know these reassurances were not made in good faith. If legislated, these measures will result in grave consequences for the competitiveness of Australian companies. It will deter investment in Australian companies, making it harder for them to raise capital, and more reliant on debt. You can read the bill’s intention here. Just mentioning franking credits is enough to release the 2019 kraken, but it is a little ridiculous that there is no part of the tax system that can be put up for even modest reforms without immediate responses of HOW DARE YOU. Anthony Albanese is in India, so he will miss the last parliament sitting of the week. Richard Marles is acting PM. Question time remains a mess. You are up to date. As always, thank you to Martin for getting us started – we’ll switch over to politics and start the day. It’s going to be at least a four-coffee morning. Ready? ACT poll finds 63% oppose new coal and gas A majority of Canberrans support a ban on new coal and gas projects in federal law, Paul Karp reports. It’s adding pressure on the independent senator for the ACT, David Pocock, to withhold support from Labor’s safeguard mechanism bill which aims to reduce industry greenhouse emissions but has been criticised for not doing enough to achieve that aim, by relying on carbon offsets instead of “real” emission reductions. The uComms poll of 1,112 residents of the Australian Capital Territory, commissioned by the Australia Institute, found 63% oppose new coal and gas, and 82% oppose the unlimited use of carbon credits to offset pollution. The release of the poll comes as the Albanese government prepares to stare down a 4pm Thursday deadline to respond to a Senate order for forecasts of how big industrial emitters would use carbon credits to meet obligations created by the safeguard mechanism.

Anthony Albanese will join the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi at the stadium bearing his name, to celebrate “75 years of friendship through cricket” for a range of events before the match. Albanese and Modi will be taken through the India-Australia Platinum Hall of Fame within the stadium before the prime ministers meet the players. Australia’s captain Steve Smith and India’s skipper Rohit Sharma are expected to introduce all their players to both leaders before the national anthems are played. Albanese is expected to stay at the Ahmedabad colosseum for about an hour before moving on to other commitments in Mumbai and Delhi. According to reports, Modi will stay on to do some TV commentary about the match. Australian business leaders, including Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce, Fortescue Metals boss Andrew Forrest and Commonwealth Bank chief executive Matt Comyn, have joined Albanese on his first trip to India as prime minister. The final crowd figure will be a source of fascination, with up to 85,000 of the day one tickets in the 132,000-capacity stadium set aside for local families and students. The record attendance for a single day of Test cricket stands at 91,112 from the start of the 2013-14 Ashes battle at the MCG. After a near five-year rebuild, the stadium in the capital of the Indian state of Gujarat reopened in February 2020. The first event there was a political event when Donald Trump arrived in India, with the former US president infamously mispronouncing the names of cricket icons Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli during a speech. A study published in the journal Nature has found that smoke from the 2019-20 Black Summer bushfires temporarily depleted the ozone layer by 3% to 5% in 2020. Particles in bushfire smoke can activate molecules that destroy the ozone layer, according to research that suggests future ozone recovery may be delayed by increasingly intense and frequent fires. Smoke from the 2019-20 bushfires, which circulated around the globe, was ejected into the stratosphere, the second layer in Earth’s atmosphere, by a pyrocumulonimbus cloud. Read Donna Lu’s full story here: Morning, and welcome to our live politics blog. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be bringing you a few of the top stories breaking overnight and likely to make news today before Amy Remeikis takes charge. Anthony Albanese will join his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to celebrate “75 years of friendship through cricket” as the two countries’ men’s teams take each other on in the fourth Test in Ahmedabad today. Albanese is expected to stay at the stadium for about an hour before moving on to other commitments in Mumbai and Delhi, although Modi will reportedly do some TV commentary about the match – which could set a world attendance record of 110,000, surpassing the current record holder, the MCG. Lidia Thorpe, the independent senator, has said she is shocked that Warren Mundine’s Conservative Political Action Conference Australia has used her image in their advertising against the voice to parliament. Although she stood down from the Greens to campaign for a sovereignty treaty, she has not ruled out backing the yes campaign. So she was angered when she saw her picture. “There’s no consent, no permission,” she said, adding that using the picture, in which she is wearing face paint applied by an elder, shows that CPAC is disrespecting the “protocols of the elder”. The former head of the independent watchdog tasked with investigating the department responsible for the robodebt program will be questioned by the royal commission today. Richard Glenn served as acting commonwealth ombudsman in 2017 when an investigation into the human services department took place. His appearance follows that of former senior assistant ombudsman Louise Macleod, who broke down when she told the commission of her failure to convince her superiors to publish her legal criticisms of the robodebt scheme. With all that, let’s get going for the day …"

                    "bodyText": "Why does Afghanistan matter? It matters to me because I fought there. Lost friends there. From a remote base in Helmand, I served alongside Afghans who I first worried might kill us, but then learned to trust with my life. Although that feels a long time ago and a long way away, I think about it every day. Eighteen months ago, the Taliban’s victory ended everything we were fighting for in Afghanistan. Ukraine then provided the perfect excuse to policymakers already eager to forget the trauma of that failure. Ukraine is colossally important – but a year on from Russia’s invasion, we forget Afghanistan at our peril. The first reason is simple morality. We have a responsibility to those suffering in Afghanistan – particularly those who risked all for us. Second, having invested £27.7bn and 457 lives, we should preserve what we can. Because despite all the waste, the last 20 years have seen infant mortality halve and education and infrastructure improve considerably. But the greatest argument is our own interest. The risk is high. Afghanistan is already a greater source of instability and a renewed safe haven for international extremism. That includes the Pakistani Taliban, who aim to take over that nuclear-armed state just as their brethren took over Afghanistan. Our policy reflects too little of this. The official line is enduring commitment, and promises to move heaven and earth for those most in danger. But in practice Afghanistan is being swept under the carpet. That is most starkly evident in reported plans to slash our Afghan aid budget, even as need soars. At a personal level, two schemes – the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme (ACRS) and Afghan relocations and assistance policy (Arap) – were meant to help the thousands who didn’t get out, despite the heroic Operation Pitting to evacuate British nationals and eligible Afghans. But they have been so hampered by conditions, bureaucracy and delay that they are effectively dysfunctional. The damning result is that, 18 months on, not a single person has left Afghanistan under ACRS under pathway 3, open to those at-risk individuals who worked for or were affiliated with the British government. Not one. Arap has relocated 12,000 people – but more than half left before the final UK withdrawal. Contrast that with the 220,000 UK visas so far granted to Ukrainians months after the invasion. Afghans who served and sacrificed alongside me are desperate – from the soldier who rescued an injured British officer but has waited more than a year for a decision, to the captain with seven family members executed, who was rejected outright. Both schemes increasingly feel like unobtainable prizes dangled in front of desperate people. But even if we wanted to act, what could we do? First, we can carefully, quickly give sanctuary to those we worked with – and to our fair share of the many facing imminent danger even without a direct foreign link. Second, ministers must maintain our aid and diplomacy. We should assess where aid might empower the Taliban, which might mean some difficult choices. But we must not walk away, and we should commission a credible, big-hitting policy lead – a David Miliband or Rory Stewart. Third, we should engage with relevant powers – the US, but also China, Pakistan and others. I’m sceptical the Taliban will listen, but we need to avoid conflict-fuelling rivalries and build consensus that stability is in everyone’s interests. Lastly, we should engage with Afghans. Yes, including the Taliban – within tight limits. The hard reality is that they currently appear incapable of meaningful compromise. We should always leave the door open, but we should be extremely careful about legitimising them until that changes. That reflects a critical point. Amid all the upheaval, our strategic interest remains fundamentally unchanged: an Afghanistan, without a long-term foreign presence, that does not incubate instability or international terrorism. Durably achieving that requires a pluralistic government that avoids large-scale kleptocracy or abuses – the key (though not only) drivers of conflict and collapse after 2001. A basic level of democratic power-sharing, justice and rights is not idealism: indeed, the failure to seriously prioritise them was the most important reason we failed. That means we should convene scattered Afghan civil society and political actors, as well as building up capacity and institutions as far as possible, to lay the foundation for an eventual transition to democratic pluralism when the opportunity arises again. That may sound like wishful thinking. It may indeed require longer-term horizons. But the Taliban are repeating many of the exclusive, repressive mistakes of those they defeated. They already face internal conflict and souring regional relations. They are also less monolithic than many assume. We should not fuel conflict, but we should not assume the new status quo will last or that compromise will always be impossible. Above all, we should stop repeating mistakes ourselves – both the post-1992 abandonment and the disastrous short-termism and misplaced objectives after 2001. It may be a lot harder now than it once was, but the right path remains the same. It is time we finally took it. There is an Afghan saying: “bradar ba bradar, essobesh barabar”. Roughly translated, it means: “Between friends, the account should be settled”. We still owe a debt – not just to Afghans, but to ourselves. We must not forget it.

                    "bodyText": "National Grid paid some of the highest prices this winter for gas-generated power on Tuesday night as it scrambled to keep the lights on during one of the coldest weeks of the year. Data from the electricity system’s administrator, Elexon, showed the Coryton power station in Essex had bids accepted to produce power at £1,950 per megawatt hour (MWh) on Tuesday evening. The sums are well above average prices of between £200 and £400 per megawatt hour, although they remain below those paid on 12 December, when National Grid paid £27m in a single day to get power stations to crank up supply. In December, Rye House power station in Hertfordshire received a record £6,000 a MWh. In total, the cost of balancing the system on Tuesday this week was estimated at between £5m and £10m. One industry source said the price of sourcing power from gas peaking plants had “raised eyebrows”. The cold, still weather reduced wind power and pushed up demand this week, while strikes at EDF’s nuclear plants in France also put a strain on the grid. To counter this, National Grid called on coal plants that were put on standby for the winter into action for the first time, as well as sourcing power from Dinorwig, a vast, pumped hydroelectric power plant in north Wales nicknamed “Electric Mountain”, which is the fastest source of electricity in the UK. Industry sources said Coryton, owned by InterGen, could have earned as much as £2m on Tuesday but failed to deliver all of the power originally offered up. InterGen was bought by Czech financier Pavel Hubáček’s Creditas investment group in January. National Grid relies on offering the right prices to incentivise power plants to help balance supply and demand. Generators bid to provide power at a specified price. The next highest accepted offers after Coryton were Uniper’s Connah’s Quay power station in north Wales – which received £999 per MWh and Rocksavage Power Station in near Liverpool, also owned by InterGen, which received £750 per MWh. Rye House – owned by VPI, a subsidiary of the Swiss trading multinational Vitol – is understood to have bid £5,750 per MWh but its offer was not accepted. The profits of gas-fired peaking plants – so-called because they tend to be fired up at peak consumption times when other contributors to the grid, such as windfarms, underperform – have been in the spotlight over the winter. Their rates have jumped since the invasion of Ukraine, leading to calls for their profits to be capped. Despite increasing amounts of renewable electricity generation, Britain remains reliant on gas. Ofgem is expected to soon publish proposals designed to prevent backup generators from receiving “excessive” profits as part of their licence conditions. Peaking plant owners argue they provide a rapid source of electricity supplies, and only produce profits sporadically while detractors say they are owned by sophisticated traders maximising returns when the market is tight. National Grid warned last October that Britain could suffer rolling blackouts this winter as Russian gas supplies were turned down after the war in Ukraine. However, mild weather and strong gas storage in Europe have eased those fears. The Grid expects to pay between £220m and £420m to keep five coal units on standby this winter. A spokesperson for InterGen said: “InterGen’s plants provide a crucial function in the energy system by keeping the lights on when demand is high and renewable generation is low. “This flexibility reduces the need for many power stations to run continuously, reducing the overall cost and carbon intensity of the grid.” National Grid and Uniper declined to comment."

                    "bodyText": "The Australian government has sought to assure south-east Asian and Pacific countries that its nuclear-powered submarine plan – to be announced early next week – aims to safeguard “the peace and the stability of our region”. After a series of leaks about the potential shape of the Aukus deal, the opposition offered bipartisan support to the government’s overall decisions, while pledging to “fight to make sure the outcome is achieved as quickly as possible”. The comments follow a report by the Guardian that the long-term plan for Australian nuclear-powered submarines would likely involve a British submarine design with heavy use of American technology. That does not preclude a US interim solution to plug a potential capability gap caused by the retirement of Australia’s existing Collins class conventional submarines from the late 2030s. Reuters cited four US officials as saying Australia was expected to buy up to five US Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines in the 2030s as part of the Aukus deal. The US president, Joe Biden, will welcome the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, to San Diego to make the announcement on Monday US time. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, refused to confirm the details in parliament on Thursday, saying the announcement would be made “very shortly”. Marles, also the Labor defence minister, acknowledged that the 18-month process to refine the plans with the US and the UK had started under the former Coalition government. He specifically mentioned the former prime minister Scott Morrison and the former defence minister Peter Dutton “because this is a moment that we want to be – and we know is – a bipartisan moment of huge significance to our country”. “It is difficult to overstate the step that, as a nation, we are about to take,” Marles said. “Australia will become just the seventh country to have the ability to operate a nuclear-powered submarine. We have never operated a military capability at this level before.” Marles said it would be “a massive industrial endeavour, which will see thousands of jobs created over the coming decades, but much more importantly, will contribute to the technological advancement of our wider economy”. Some countries – such as Indonesia and Malaysia – have previously expressed concerns that the Aukus plans could contribute to an arms race in the region. Marles sought to allay such concerns, saying although the submarines would have the capability to operate at war, “the true intent” was to defend the rules-based order across the region. He said Australia was an island trading nation and “the defence of Australia doesn’t really mean that much unless we can have collective security”. “So I want to say at this moment to our neighbours and to our friends around the world that as Australia invests in its defence, as we acquire this nuclear-powered submarine capability, we do so as part of making our contribution to the peace and the stability of our region and of the world,” Marles said. Dutton, now the opposition leader, said he agreed that “our neighbours should hear the very clear message that this is about providing peace and stability for our future and for theirs”. Dutton previously caused a stir as defence minister by saying the country should “prepare for war” and by explicitly predicting Australia would join the US to defend Taiwan in a potential conflict with China. But he told parliament on Thursday: “We are not an aggressive nation. We are a nation that strives for peace.” The Liberal leader – who last week issued public warnings about the risk of going for a yet-to-be-developed British design – said the Australian people could see “the two major parties in this country working together in the nation’s best interests”. “We will support the decisions of the government under Aukus and fight to make sure the outcome is achieved as quickly as possible,” Dutton said. Albanese, who is in India on a trade mission ahead of his onward travel to the US, also refused to be drawn on the details of the Aukus plan. He said the announcement would be made “in the appropriate way, on Monday, US time, in San Diego”. “This is a joint arrangement between Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom,” the prime minister told reporters in Ahmedabad on Thursday. “We’re great friends. We have over a century of standing side by side during peacetime and during conflict, and I look forward to the announcements next week.” Albanese reiterated that Australia would “retain absolutely our sovereignty, our absolute sovereignty, 100%” amid lingering questions over the control of the submarines given the reliance on US and UK support. The head of the Australian government’s nuclear-powered submarine taskforce, V Adm Jonathan Mead, said on Wednesday the looming announcement would show that the plans were “really a trilateral partnership” with US and UK, rather than a binary choice. The Australian government has sought to “stabilise” the relationship with China – the country’s largest trading partner – after years of tensions. But Marles last week renewed concerns that China was “driving the largest conventional military buildup we’ve seen anywhere in the world since the second world war – and much of this buildup is opaque”."

A major bill is closer to being realised after Labor agreed to Greens’ demands not to use the proposed national reconstruction fund to finance new gas and coal projects or native logging. “Coal and gas are the biggest cause of the climate crisis, so this is a big win for the climate and a big win for jobs and the economy,” the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said. Greens support means the bill is now closer to passing the Senate later this month. If passed, it will establish an off-budget $15bn investment fund that the industry minister, Ed Husic, says is “one of the largest peacetime investments in manufacturing this country has ever seen”. Bandt thanked the government for its “constructive approach” in negotiating the deal, and setting a positive tone between the two parties still trying to break an impasse over Labor’s safeguard mechanism policy.

Top news PM promises ‘absolute sovereignty’ over submarines | Albanese made the remarks amid revelations that the UK had succeeded in its bid to sell Australia British-designed nuclear submarines. Australia will become the seventh country to have a nuclear-powered submarine fleet. That has drawn the ire of China, which has argued Australia’s possession of the nuclear reactors is a breach of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. Oscar goodie bags contain Queensland “scrub” | Oscar nominees are set to receive one square metre of land in outback Australia in their gift bags this year, but environmental organisations have questioned the environmental mission of the company. “Pieces of Australia” is one of a number of brands to pay $4,000 to secure a spot in the hamper which is unaffiliated with the Academy, but sent by the company Distinctive Assets to the acting and directing nominees. But those gifted the land won’t be able to use the “symbolic souvenir”. Home values down 7.9% nationally | … which is the largest slide over a 12-month period on record. Leading the way was Sydney – down 13.4%, then Hobart 11.8% Melbourne 9.6%, Brisbane 6.8% and Canberra 6.7%. Bucking the trend were Adelaide (up 5.1%), Darwin (up 2.9%) and Perth (up 2.4%). Labor, Greens back four-day work week | Senators from the two parties joined forces in recommending a four-day work week trial at full pay and more than double paid parental leave to 52 weeks. Free transport day for Sydney | To make up for yesterday’s peak-hour meltdown of the Sydney train network, the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has ordered a fare-free day be instituted. Perilous migrant path from China to the US | There’s a growing number of would-be Chinese migrants trying to reach the US via a dangerous jungle between Colombia and Panama. Numbers surged last year amid tough Covid lockdowns. “I don’t know much about the US, but at least it’d be better than living in China … We’re like animals. We migrate to a warmer place, instead of staying in a cold place. We don’t want to be frozen to death,” one asylum seeker said. Tucker Carlson ‘passionately hates’ Trump | Or so a text message on 4 January 2021, two days before the Capitol Hill insurrection, said. “I hate him passionately … What he’s good at is destroying things. He’s the undisputed world champion of that. He could easily destroy us if we play it wrong,” the Fox News host wrote. Georgia protests | Thousands are continuing to protest against a proposed law that would create a “foreign agents” register for organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding overseas. The law is similar to a 2012 law in Russia, and has raised concerns it could jeopardise Georgia’s chances of joining the EU. Greece protests | Tens of thousands have staged protest rallies and workers staged a 24-hour general strike as anger over last week’s train disaster intensified. “This is more than a train collision and a tragic railway accident. You get the sense that the country has derailed,” said Nasos Iliopoulos, a spokesperson for Greece’s main leftwing opposition party, Syriza. Full Story The battle over Labor’s key climate policy Negotiations over Labor’s major climate policy are in deadlock.

Listen to this 20-min episode. What they said … *** “Some of the Closing the Gap targets are going backwards … The one that really concerns me that has, where the statistics have gone backwards slightly, is the healthy birth weight of babies … It is not good enough and I know everyone in this House agrees with that.” - Linda Burney Healthy birth weight is one of several Closing the Gap targets going backwards, the Indigenous affairs minister told parliament today. In numbers An NT government report also found levels of property break-ins were down by nearly 46% and youth offences were down by 36% since the restrictions were brought. Before bed read Twitter has broken down six times this year - most recently on Monday. Experts point to the sacking of thousands of workers, leaving too few engineers to catch and fix problems when they arise. Since Musk completed his US$44bn takeover of Twitter in October last year, the workforce has been reduced from 7,500 employees to about 2,000. “The result is that eventually problems occur which are sufficiently serious to be noticed by large portions of Twitter’s user base,” said Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London.

                    "bodyText": "Ministers must take control of the UK’s energy system, removing the barriers to planning permission and problems with the national electricity grid, to build the windfarms and other renewable power needed to meet net-zero goals, government advisers have warned. Chris Stark, chief executive of the committee on climate change, the statutory adviser, said the task was too urgent to wait until after a general election, expected within the next 18 months. “It would be an enormous mistake to wait until the next general election to introduce new ambitious policy,” he said. He highlighted the planning regime, which effectively prevents onshore windfarms from being built – despite government promises to remove the barriers – and which is one of the factors, along with lack of investment, stymying the construction of connections to the national electricity grid. The planning regime was “gummed up”, Stark said. “The best response is to get the planning regime, the regulatory regime, and the consenting regime sorted out,” he said. Stark urged the government to act within the next few weeks, saying there was a “window” as the chancellor of the exchequer delivers the budget next week, and before the end of the month a report is due from ministers on how they will meet the UK’s climate targets. “That is the window, to signal to the investor community that [the UK is] responding in the right way to this crisis, and have plans in place,” he said. Without clear action from the government, the UK would miss out on vital investment opportunities, he warned, as rivals in the EU, China and the US have been gearing up rapidly for a trade war on green technology. The EU will set out next week plans to achieve its net-zero goals by building up green technology within the bloc, while the US is boosting green industries through its Inflation Reduction Act. The government’s target of decarbonising the UK’s electricity generation fully by 2035, necessary to meet the long-term goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, was achievable, but not without massive changes, the CCC warned. Current policies, and the current planning regime, would not achieve the target, the CCC made clear in a report published on Thursday. “We know how to do this, but the problem is that government is not putting in place the policies needed for it to happen at the pace it needs to,” said Stark. “The system is not ready to deliver change at the scale and pace necessary.” A small amount of gas-fired power – equivalent to 2% of national electricity generation – would still be needed after 2035, the committee found. This is to ensure security of supply in periods of “wind drought”, when windfarms are not producing sufficient electricity. As the UK moves to cleaner electric vehicles and heat pumps, demand for electricity is set to rise, by as much as 50% by 2035. Alongside new windfarms, solar power generation and nuclear plants, the UK will need far more capacity to store electricity. That could take the form of large batteries and hydrogen, which can be generated from electricity and stored until needed. Work on these hydrogen power stations should start now, rather than waiting even a year, the CCC said. The report also called into question the burning of trees in power stations, calling for any power plant using wood to be fitted with carbon capture and storage technology (CCS), which must happen “as early as feasible”, and ensure that they are not given contracts to operate without such technology beyond 2027. This would apply chiefly to Drax, the UK’s largest biomass power station. The report set out 25 recommendations, including a new energy infrastructure group, led by a minister, that would take responsibility for decarbonising power; new funding this year to start hydrogen power projects, to be operational by 2030; ensure any new gas-fired power plants are ready for CCS or hydrogen; and to work on CCS technology, including a plan for transporting carbon dioxide. Jess Ralston, head of energy at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: “There is a huge investment opportunity in a cleaner, cheaper electricity system that isn’t blown about by international gas markets, but government needs a clearer plan for investors to pile in. The additional costs involved in balancing a renewables grid are minimal, particularly when compared to the cost of gas power.” Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, pointed to the government’s apparent back-pedalling on a promise to lift the ban on onshore windfarms, and failure to mandate solar panels on new houses. “This report confirms that genuine energy security requires embracing abundant and affordable renewables to cut energy bills as well as carbon emissions. But the government’s current energy policy requires wading through treacle in order to do so – through its own painfully poor planning and agonisingly slow delivery,” she said."

                    "headline": "A welcome return to normality: how France sees the Macron-Sunak summit",
                    "bodyText": "As Emmanuel Macron prepares to welcomes Rishi Sunak to Paris’s Franco-British summit on Friday, the Élysée sees it as a “turning of the page” – the end of a nightmare chapter in cross-Channel relations. The mood between France and the UK had in recent years plummeted to its worst state in decades with bitter rows over submarine contracts, fishing rights and who was to blame for the catastrophic deaths of people trying to reach the UK coast on small boats. The fact that a Franco-British summit is taking place at all is seen as a kind of victory in Paris. “Our priority is to reconnect and get back into the habit of working together,” an Elysée official said. Language in recent years had been inflammatory – from Boris Johnson’s franglais message of “donnez-moi un break” to Liz Truss refusing to say whether Macron was a friend or a foe while running for the Conservative leadership. French officials saw Johnson as a populist engaged in constant France-bashing to numb the electorate to the impact of Brexit. As one diplomat said at the height of the bad times, trust between the two countries had evaporated. Historically, Franco-British summits happened almost yearly, but the ill-feeling saw a five-year hiatus since the newly elected Macron met Theresa May at a Sandhurst summit in 2018, at the time of the centenary events to mark the end of the first world war. Now it’s Russia’s war in Ukraine that has given impetus to the neighbours to “reset” the relationship. “War in Ukraine has brought sense of urgency and a clear rationale for Paris and London to find solutions to their differences,” said Alice Billon-Galland, a research fellow in the Europe programme at thinktank Chatham House, and co-author of the report, Rebooting the Entente, on defence cooperation. Joint announcements are expected on the training of Ukrainian forces, as well as fresh cooperation on future weapons development and nuclear energy. France also wants to improve the flow of young people and students – as well science and research, between France and the UK – which has suffered since Brexit. But for the UK, the issue of migration and the crisis of people risking their lives to cross the Channel on small boats has taken centre-stage. The two leaders are expected to agree a further joint drive to “strengthen” security operations on the French coast with a new “multi-year financing” plan to bring more security staff, equipment and infrastructure to the rugged beaches around Calais to stop boats departing and people gathering. About 800 people including regular police, border control forces and customs officers are already deployed daily in anti-migrant operations in northern France. The drive to ramp this up is already sparking concern from charities that the security crackdown and hostile policies towards migrants in perilous conditions in northern France is not a solution. Charities argue that the only solution is legal routes for safe passage. Sunak’s proposed new draft immigration law, which would prevent people who arrived in the UK illegally on small boats from making an asylum claim, is, for now, seen in France as an issue for UK domestic politics. An Élysée official pointed out that the proposed law was at a very early stage. Paris said it had taken note of the questions by bodies such as the United Nations over whether Sunak’s plan respects international law. An official said they did not see “any major impact on the French coast” at this stage. “It’s a British debate,” said Elvire Fabry, a senior research fellow at the Jacques Delors Institute. She said the French and British positions on dealing with the asylum issue stood in contrast to one another. France would still like to see Britain set up an asylum processing centre in northern France, to examine claims and allow people to travel legally to the UK if accepted, whereas the UK was currently sending out the opposite message on stopping applications. Ultimately, the Élysée sees Friday’s summit as an important first opportunity for Sunak and Macron to spend “real time” working together. With the new Windsor framework smoothing UK relations with the EU, the pro-European Macron and pro-Brexit Sunak can fall back on what they have in common: both are former investment bankers of around the same age, both are facing strikes on the domestic front – the UK’s public sector strikes and France’s protests over raising the pension age. “The summit is a welcome return to a kind of normality after years of fracas and Brexit ideology where UK politicians and media used French-bashing for their own internal politics, which was very irritating to the French,” said Pauline Schnapper, professor of contemporary British civilisation at the Sorbonne university. “The return to diplomatic normality and serious work between the two governments is a big relief for everyone.”"

                    "bodyText": "An enthusiastic Rishi Sunak has told ministers to expect a positive outcome next week when he travels to San Diego to unveil a deal to supply nuclear-powered submarines to Australia as part of the Aukus pact with the US. Multiple sources said they believed the UK had succeeded in its bid to sell British-designed nuclear submarines to Australia, a deal that will safeguard the long-term future of the shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness. A senior minister said Sunak had told colleagues he was delighted by the outcome of the negotiations, which have been going on for 18 months and have presented Australia with a choice between a British or a US design, based on the existing Astute or Virginia class submarines. “The deal has definitely gone our way. The prime minister was buzzing about it when he told ministers, smiling and bouncing on the balls of his feet,” the minister said. A second source outside government with knowledge of the talks said they had also been told to expect a British design success when the deal is announced on Monday, although any final submarine will also make heavy use of US technology. Sunak is due to travel to the west coast for a trilateral summit with Joe Biden, the US president, and Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister, on Monday, where he also expected to unveil a refresh of Britain’s integrated review of defence and foreign policy in the light of the war in Ukraine. Supplying Australia with a nuclear-powered submarine was the centrepiece for the Aukus defence pact, announced in September 2021, with the US and UK agreeing to share secret reactor technology in a surprise deal, so Canberra could dump an alternative diesel-powered design from France. The expectation, one source indicated, was that Australia would work jointly on a design for a next generation submarine with the UK, evolving from the existing Astute submarine design, although it may not be seaworthy until the 2040s because of the complexity of the work. Further reports last night suggested that the short-term gap could be plugged by Australia buying up to five Virginia-class submarines from the US as part of the three-way deal. Meanwhile, an alternative plan that the UK could even be willing to sell or lease the two Astute class submarines yet to be completed at Barrow, HMS Agincourt and HMS Agamemnon, is wide of the mark. Naval analysts say the UK’s submarine fleet is already stretched and could not afford a sudden reduction. Australia will become the seventh country to have a nuclear-powered submarine, relying on an enriched uranium reactor, propulsion technology that will put the country’s diesel-powered navy on a technological par with China. But it will require Australia, which is not a nuclear power, to be supplied with a reactor, a move that Beijing has argued is a breach of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. The three Aukus powers say that is not the case, and that any reactors will be supplied “welded, shielded and sealed shut” according to Australian officials overseeing the effort. The new submarines will not carry nuclear weapons. But James Acton, a nuclear expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it was not yet clear how the nuclear waste generated by the propulsion reactors will be dealt with – and whether that will happen in Australia or the UK or US. Defence experts said the time it would take to build the new submarines meant that there may be some related short-term developments. The US is keen to be able to base its nuclear submarines in Australia, making it easier to patrol the South Pacific, as it seeks to retain naval parity with China. A UK government spokesperson said: “When we announced the Aukus partnership in September 2021 we said there would be an 18-month scoping period to determine the optimal path to procuring Australia nuclear-powered submarines. The outcome of the scoping period is due to be announced soon.” A No 10 spokesperson said they could not pre-empt any future announcements."

                    "bodyText": "I have a visitor that stops me sleeping, wakes me early in the morning and hangs around most days uninvited and unwanted: I am living with fear. Each day when I open my eyes, there’s a few seconds of semiconscious calm before my heart sets off to sprint in this race without end. Sometimes I try to calm myself down with deep breathing, but mostly I simply flee from my bed, the cold biting deep as I descend the stairs to make tea and talk myself down. Breakfast is impossible with adrenaline coursing through my body at max strength. I have a chalkboard in the kitchen where I used to write shopping reminders. Now I use it to self-medicate, with greetings card therapy written in my scrawly hand: “Things can get better” and “Nothing lasts for ever”. I repeat them out loud to try to will them to be true. I feel constantly vulnerable from the insecurity that has invaded my life: the rented roof over my head, precarious freelance work, the cost of living now I’m in my early 60s. I’m not the only one going through tough times, but when I close my front door, I am alone. I share about my predicament, up to a point. I recently house-sat for a friend, who left a note beside the central heating thermostat: “Don’t be cold.” The pure joy of hot radiators and oven-roasted vegetables was a great respite. But I tend not to talk about the darker stuff around losing work and having no safety net, because I am embarrassed and ashamed. Friends’ lives are neat and orderly. Mine is a cold mess. Seated at a friend’s dining table, in their warm house, I prefer to savour every minute rather than dredge up the fears that are following me. And the thought that perhaps I could end up homeless. I play a game of sliding doors in my head and wonder how it must feel to live their lives. How close I came to being them. Everyone has demons, I decide. We’re all human. When I was little, my mum took Valium from the doctor “to control her nerves”. Back then, mental illness was stigmatised. You were told to pull yourself together, to get on with it. When things improved, Mum still kept a single Valium in her purse, a red and green torpedo to neutralise whatever threatened to spiral out of control. It got gnarled and squashed, and eventually she threw it away. I assume that was the day she no longer felt afraid. I long for a time when fear is no longer my shadow. These days, I can access mental health support with the click of a computer mouse, but it is harder to solve the systemic inequality that pervades some of our lives: the NHS on its knees, social care in tatters, food banks barely keeping working families afloat. Talking therapies help to dampen anxiety, but what is there to do about the cold, hunger and poverty that perpetuates the terror in the first place? There’s a bigger fear too. In 1980, the Protect and Survive leaflet dropped through our letterbox, advising families on how to protect themselves in the event of nuclear attack. I was 19 and took the advice seriously, determined to do what I could to face off the threat of nuclear war. My dad had been in Hiroshima after the bomb dropped, and I’d grown up knowing it must never happen again. When the leaflet arrived, I felt angry that the world was on the brink, yet resilient enough to believe my generation could save it. Forty years on, the war in Ukraine has turned the world upside down again. And I am in a different position. This world, my world, is scary. My only hope is to protect myself, to survive. Each day I work hard to shore up my mental health. I resist thinking about the future too much and try to believe those in charge will see sense, before it’s too late. For the world. And me.

                    "headline": "Brazilian TikToker goes viral showing the ‘cheerfulness of the favela’",
                    "bodyText": "Heads turn as Raphael Vicente walks down the narrow streets of Maré, a sprawling favela complex in Rio de Janeiro’s gritty north zone. One woman rushes out of a cafeteria to ask for an autograph. “Autographs are so old-school, let’s take a selfie!” the 22-year-old laughs before snapping a picture. Taller than average with a wide smile, Vicente is easily recognizable – and he’s an internet sensation with 3.1 million followers on TikTok and nearly 1 million on Instagram. Fans follow him for his funny, relatable videos, a mixture of skits on life at home in the favela and creative takes on social media trends. The TikToker wants to use his fame to change the way favela residents are perceived in Brazil and show that there is much more to these communities than crime and poverty. “Raphael has an important role … because he’s showing the cheerfulness of the favela,” says his sister, Maria Eduarda “Maddu” Reis. “Even people from the favela are used to seeing their community depicted in the media as just tragedy, violence, shootings, police operations.” Vicente shows the human and humorous side of favela life by filming his videos with the people he considers his closest family: his 21-year-old sister and 70-year-old grandmother, as well as the family of his 67-year-old godmother. According to Fernanda Carrera, a professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro’s school of communication, Vicente’s visibility is significant given the under-representation of Black, favela-dwelling Brazilians in traditional media – even though 56% of Brazilians are Black and almost a quarter of Rio’s residents live in favelas. “I’m a Black, poor, gay boy who has lived in Maré [my entire life],” says Vicente. “Us people, we don’t have the same opportunities as those who don’t live in the favela, our struggle always requires double the amount of grit, double the amount of work.” Vicente started posting videos online at age 14, honing his craft across different platforms before finding his niche on TikTok in 2020. Entirely self-taught, he is scriptwriter, actor and editor for his videos – a “genius of audio-visual production”, in Carrera’s words. As well as humorous sketches and TikTok dances, Vicente produces more elaborate choreographies with a dance troupe he founded, Dance Maré. His content hits the spot in hyper-connected Brazil, where people love an online trend and tend to make a joke out of even the darkest of situations. “I see how much humour serves as an escape valve when bad things happen,” says Vicente. “People tell me they’re having a bad day, and that watching one of our videos made their day better.” He puts his success down to the relatability and high quality of his content – and the side-splitting performance of his relatives, whom he readily admits are the true stars of his videos. Whether they are acting out a role, playing a caricature of themselves, or twerking to the latest viral TikTok song, the women who raised Vicente take their job seriously, while also having the time of their lives. “I think it’s marvellous!” cackles his godmother Luciene Elias, for whom filming the videos was a lifesaver during the pandemic lockdowns. “People say to us, your family is an inspiration, I wish my family was like yours, close, happy, contagious, and that’s really gratifying,” says Reis. This fun-loving family might not fit the conventional image of the nuclear family, but they are not so unusual in Brazil, where father abandonment is common and a growing number of children are raised by their grandmothers. “Raphael Vicente’s family is the authentic Brazilian family, just not the one we see represented in the media,” says Carrera, who researches race and representation in digital culture. The high point of Vicente’s career so far was getting noticed by the Colombian pop star Shakira with a remix of her 2010 World Cup anthem Waka Waka, released during last year’s tournament. The success of the clip, which shows the Dance Maré crew bopping through the festooned favela, landed the dancers on national television, where they were congratulated by Shakira herself. Two months later, Vicente and his family are still giddy with disbelief. “When he told me, ‘Gran, Shakira spoke to us,’ I thought, that’s it, she’s going to sue him [over the music rights],” says his grandmother, Maria Antonia da Silva. The video’s success also has a deeper meaning. Vicente recounts how it was released the same week that a heavy-handed police raid in Maré left several dead. Within a few days of the clip going viral, a Google search for Maré-related news threw up positive articles about the World Cup dance rather than the usual violence-dominated headlines. “I actually succeeded, for real,” says a visibly moved Vicente. “Little by little, I can change this reality, this vision that people outside the favela have of us.”"

                    "bodyText": "Australia will put nuclear safety “above all else” as it begins the “generational challenge” of building and operating nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus pact, the government’s top adviser has said. V Adm Jonathan Mead has moved to allay concerns – both at home and across the region – about nuclear safety as Australia, the US and the UK prepare to announce their detailed plans within days. The head of the Australian government’s nuclear-powered submarine taskforce has also insisted that the likely presence of American and British personnel on Australian boats would not inhibit Australian command and control. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Mead said there were likely to be more Australians onboard British and American nuclear-powered submarines as part of the training process. He said as many as 40 Australians may potentially be onboard a US submarine at any one time. The US president, Joe Biden, is due to welcome the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the British PM, Rishi Sunak, to the US for a joint announcement early next week about the practicalities of Australia acquiring at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Mead, who leads a taskforce of more than 350 Australian officials who have been working on the plans, said this would be “a generational challenge for Australia and will probably redefine Australia’s strategic personality”. But he sought to reassure partners in south-east Asia and the Pacific about Australia’s intentions. “I can give them a commitment that we will hold the standards of safety above all else,” Mead said on Wednesday. “Look at the track record of US and UK nuclear submarines previously, look at Australia’s own track record in the way we manage our research reactor at Lucas Heights, and the way that we have managed visiting nuclear-powered ships and submarines over the past 60 years.” Mead described nuclear safety as “the No 1 consideration as we build, operate, maintain and regulate the nuclear powered submarines”. This would include safety of the submarine crew, safety of the community, and environmental protection. He said Australia had received “a very clear message from the US and the UK that safety is paramount” but added: “I think the Australian people would absolutely expect that, so we’re going to make sure that we set a gold standard when it comes to safety.” ‘Welded, shielded and sealed’ for 33 years Some nuclear experts have argued the Aukus arrangement depends on “a glaring and worrying loophole” in safeguards that could be exploited by others. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) does not ban non-nuclear weapon countries such as Australia from having nuclear-powered naval vessels. The Chinese government has also sought to sow doubt about Aukus, arguing the deal would have “a grave nuclear proliferation risk and violates the object and purpose of the NPT”. But Mead said each nuclear reactor would “come to us welded, shielded and sealed” and Australia was in continuing dialogue with the International Atomic Energy Agency. He said they were making “excellent progress” on an inspection and verification regime, while acknowledging the need “to protect very sensitive technology of the US and UK”. “Nuclear-powered submarines are not prohibited under the NPT,” Mead said. “Yes, the reactors will be with highly enriched uranium. But once again, they are welded, shielded and sealed for the life of the reactor. That’s 33 years. “We will implement the most stringent of security protocols to make sure that those reactors are not opened for the life of the submarine.” Sovereign control Mead was tight-lipped about the design of the submarine, the timeframes and the cost – all of which will be announced soon. But he again defended the plans against concerns raised by former prime ministers Malcolm Turnbull and Paul Keating over their potential impact on Australian sovereignty. “When we take our own sovereign control, we will clearly have some US and UK sailors there – and they may be there to provide technical advice on the reactor, or they may be upfront working with us in the combat system,” Mead said. “We welcome that technical advice, we welcome subject matter expertise. And I think that we will continue to have US and UK people in our submarines, as we will have our own people onboard their submarines.” But Mead said such arrangements would not inhibit Australian command and control. “It doesn’t matter who is onboard. If that is an Australian flagged submarine with an Australian commanding officer, there is absolutely no ambiguity when it comes to sovereign control,” he said. Asked what would happen if that technical advice was withdrawn, Mead said Australia was determined to “develop a sovereign ability to build a nuclear-powered submarine, operate a nuclear-powered submarine, maintain a nuclear-powered submarine and regulate a nuclear-powered submarine”. “So there’s an expectation by our partners, and I think Australians would have an expectation, that we must be able to do this ourselves,” Mead said. “But yes, we will have assistance, something we have assistance with many of our major programs. The US and the UK will assist us and as we develop more and more understanding of the technology, then we would be probably have less of those people in Australia.” Mead said the looming announcement would show that the plans were “really a trilateral partnership” with the US and the UK, rather than a binary choice. He said his taskforce was working closely with the South Australian government and unions to develop a supply chain and vendor base in Australia that could feed into US and UK programs. On Wednesday the British high commissioner to Australia, Vicki Treadell, rebuked the Australian opposition leader, Peter Dutton, for saying the government should pursue US Virginia class submarines over a British alternative. Treadell said she had spoken with Dutton and told him he was “commenting on an outcome he doesn’t yet know”. She told the National Press Club: “I was simply pointing out that I did not think such expressions were helpful on what is a genuine trilateral partnership started under his government.”"

                    "bodyText": "It’s approaching 9pm in Kyiv. Here is a round-up of the day’s stories: It will be an “open road” for Russian troops to capture cities in Ukraine should they seize control of Bakhmut, warned president Zelenskiy in an interview with CNN. “This is tactical for us, we understand that after Bakhmut they could go further,” he said. New intelligence reviewed by US officials suggests that a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines last year, the New York Times reported. There was no evidence that president Volodymyr Zelenskiy or his top lieutenants in Ukraine were involved in the operation, or that the perpetrators were acting at the direction of any Ukrainian government officials, the newspaper reported, citing US officials. The German government said it had taken note of the report which said new intelligence suggested a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the Nord Stream pipelines attack last year, but its own investigation has not yet reached results. A senior aide to Zelenskiy said that Kyiv was “absolutely not involved” in last year’s attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines and has no information about what happened. Russia’s deputy UN envoy said that the report “only proves that our initiative on launching an international investigation under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General is very timely.” Russia has sustained “20,000 to 30,000 casualties’’ - killed and wounded - in trying to capture Bakhmut, western officials estimated at a briefing on Tuesday. While no firm figure was offered for Ukrainian losses, the official said it was “significantly less”. Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the Ukrainian Presidency, has said 130 prisoners of war have been returned home following an exchange. Russia’s ministry of defence has issued a statement to say that 90 prisoners of war have been returned by Ukraine. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister told regional media on Tuesday that fewer than 4,000 civilians, including 38 children remain in Bakhmut. The city, the focus of fierce fighting in the Donbas region, had an estimated prewar population of about 70,000 people. Britain’s defence industry is to be blocked from profiting from the EU’s vast increase in spending on arms for Ukraine, under a leaked plan seen by the Guardian. A “massive order” of ammunition, ranging from small arms to 155mm artillery rounds, is being prepared in Brussels but only EU and Norwegian manufacturers will be able to take advantage. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has denied Kyiv was involved in attempted sabotage at a Belarusian airfield last month. Alexander Lukashenko alleged that Ukrainian and U.S. intelligence services were involved in the drone attack in late February which was claimed by Belarusian anti-government activists. A court in Moscow sentenced a student activist to eight and a half years in prison for social media posts criticizing Russia’s war in Ukraine. Dmitry Ivanov was convicted on Tuesday of spreading false information about the Russian army, AP reports. The situation is “stable and controlled” in the Luhansk region the governor, Serhiy Haidai said. In a post on Telegram, Haidai said the number of attacks in the direction of Bilogorivka and Kreminnaya had increased. Today, he said, the Russians have “pulled back to replenish their reserves”. The United Nations secretary-general, António Guterres, will meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Wednesday to discuss extending a deal with Moscow that allows the Black Sea export of Ukraine grains, according to Reuters. A 14-year-old Ukrainian girl who died after she was found unconscious on a beach in south Devon on Saturday has been named as Albina Yevko. The teenager was found on Dawlish town beach, near where she was living, on Saturday evening after a search involving a police helicopter and HM Coastguard. Ukraine has named the unarmed prisoner of war who appeared to have been shot dead by Russian soldiers, as the president delivered an overnight message resolving to “find the murderers”. In the graphic 12-second clip that first circulated on Telegram on Monday a detained combatant, named by the Ukrainian military as Tymofiy Mykolayovych Shadura, is seen standing in a shallow trench smoking a cigarette before apparently shot with automatic weapons. Poland is to send more tanks to Ukraine this week, the country’s defence minister said. Poland had promised to send 14 Leopard 2 tanks in total. A decision on a permanent deployment of a German brigade to Lithuania will be “up to Nato”, German defence minister Boris Pistorius said in response to calls by Vilnius for a larger Nato presence in the country. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that the seizure of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine would allow Moscow’s forces to mount further offensive operations. Russian forces carried out 50 airstrikes and five missile strikes overnight and Ukrainian forces repelled 37 attacks in the area around Bakhmut, according to the latest update by the General staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. Ukrainian forces claim to have carried out 15 airstrikes against Russian forces, including a strike on an anti-aircraft system. It also claimed to have shot down an SU-25 aircraft, nine Shaheed drones and eight other drones. Jan Gagin, an adviser to the Russian-installed leaders in the occupied portion of Donetsk, has claimed that Russian forces control about half of Bakhmut and have control over all the asphalt roads in the area. None of the claims about the situation in Bakhmut have been independently verified. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine is committed to defending the embattled city despite a partial encirclement. The Ukrainian president said he had held a meeting with senior generals and commanders in which it was resolved that there was “no part of Ukraine” that “can be abandoned”. Ukraine’s ongoing defence of Bakhmut is forcing Russian to engage in a costly battle for a city that “isn’t intrinsically important operationally or strategically”, according to the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Zelenskiy paid tribute to a soldier whose execution by machine gun was filmed and uploaded to social media. The graphic video shows a man smoking a cigarette who says “glory to Ukraine” before he is shot at what appears to be close range. Ukraine has started online talks with partners on extending the Black Sea grain initiative aimed at ensuring Kyiv can keep shipping grain to global markets, a senior Ukrainian government source has said on Tuesday. The source said Ukraine had not held discussions with Russia, which blockaded Ukrainian Black Sea ports after its invasion last year, but that it was Kyiv’s understanding that its partners were talking to Moscow. A Moscow court has sentenced the student activist Dmitry Ivanov to eight and a half years in prison as the Kremin escalates its crackdown on anti-war dissent. Belarus detained on Tuesday what it said was a Ukrainian “terrorist group” working with Kyiv’s intelligence services over attempted sabotage at a Belarusian airfield. Belarusian anti-government activists said last month they had blown up a sophisticated Russian military surveillance aircraft in a drone attack at an airfield near the Belarusian capital Minsk, a claim disputed by Moscow and Minsk. The Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol in Crimea has denied reports that explosions have been heard near Belbek airbase. Mikhail Razvozhaev posted to Telegram to say “The public is again writing about some kind of explosion near the airfield. This is a lie. Ship crews are training in the outer road. Everything is calm in the city.” China’s foreign minister Qin Gang says the country must strengthen its relationship with Russia in the face of continued hostility from the US. In a fiery press conference, his first appearance as foreign minister, Qin outlined China’s foreign policy agenda for the coming years, presenting its relationship with Russia as a beacon of strength and stability, and the US and its allies as a source of tension and conflict. Here are some of the latest pictures from Ukraine sent to us over the news wires: It will be an “open road” for Russian troops to capture cities in Ukraine should they seize control of Bakhmut, warned president Zelenskiy in an interview with CNN. “This is tactical for us, we understand that after Bakhmut they could go further,” Ukraine’s president told CNN host Wolf Blitzer in an interview on Tuesday. “It will be an open road for the Russians after Bakhmut to other towns in Ukraine in the Donetsk direction in the east of Ukraine.” The battle for Bakhmut, which is still under Kyiv’s control, has raged for seven months, with thousands of people killed and hundreds of buildings collapsed or charred. The few remaining civilians have been confined to basements for months with no running water, electricity or gas. In spite of the rumours of an imminent retreat of his troops, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had instructed the army to find forces to bolster the defence of the embattled city. Russia’s deputy UN envoy said that the New York Times report on who could be responsible for the attacks on the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year “only proves that our initiative on launching an international investigation under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General is very timely.” Russia plans to call a vote in the UN Security Council by the end of March on its draft resolution asking Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to establish such an inquiry, Deputy Russian UN Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy told Reuters. A senior aide to Zelenskiy said that Kyiv was “absolutely not involved” in last year’s attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines and has no information about what happened. Mykhailo Podolyak made the comments in a statement to Reuters following the release of a New York Times report citing US officials suggesting a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible. Britain’s defence industry is to be blocked from profiting from the EU’s vast increase in spending on arms for Ukraine, under a leaked plan seen by the Guardian. A “massive order” of ammunition, ranging from small arms to 155mm artillery rounds, is being prepared in Brussels but only EU and Norwegian manufacturers will be able to take advantage. France, Germany and Italy, the home of Europe’s biggest arms manufacturers are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries to the detriment of the UK, which is the world’s seventh largest arms exporter. “Essentially, this is a zero-sum game and the proposal will bolster European defence industry at the costs of those outside the union,” a diplomatic source in Brussels said. Read more here: The German government said it had taken note of a New York Times report which said new intelligence suggested a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the Nord Stream pipelines attack last year, but its own investigation has not yet reached results. Sweden, Denmark and Germany informed the United Nations Security Council a few days ago that the investigations are ongoing and that there are still no results, a spokesperson for the Chancellery said, Reuters reports. The spokesperson added: The Federal Public Prosecutor has been investigating the matter since the beginning of October 2022. It thus has sovereignty over the procedure. Ukrainian cabinet ministers have approved a mechanism for the forced evacuation of children from active combat zones, according to the country’s Ministry of Reintegration. In a Telegram post, it said from now on, the basis for mandatory evacuation is the decision of the regional military administrations, in agreement with the military command bodies and the Coordination Headquarters. Parents, or another legal representative, will accompany evacuee children it said, adding that the decision comes after the issue was taken under personal control by deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk. Hundreds of mourners packed a Kyiv church on Tuesday for the funeral of volunteers killed on a sabotage mission in Russia, following a spate of attacks along Moscow’s frontier. Mourners, many in camouflage and covering their faces, attended a service in a central church for four men – including one teenager – killed in December during an incursion into Russia’s southern Bryansk region, AFP reports. Russia’s FSB security service announced it had killed the men, saying they were armed with rifles and explosives. Russian media reported their bodies were handed over this month. The men’s coffins were draped with the banner of a nationalist battalion called Bratstvo, or Brotherhood, created on the basis of a party of the same name. Outside the church, the leader of the Brotherhood party Dmytro Korchynsky told AFP: [They were in] one of the reconnaissance sabotage groups of Bratstvo that take part in raids at the enemy’s rear, both in the occupied territories... and on Russian soil. They were killed during one of those raids. Here are some of the latest pictures from Ukraine sent to us over the news wires. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has denied Kyiv was involved in attempted sabotage at a Belarusian airfield last month. Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko alleged that Ukrainian and U.S. intelligence services were involved in the drone attack in late February which was claimed by Belarusian anti-government activists. Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said in a statement: It is clear that this is another attempt to create an artificial threat from Ukraine for the sake of justifying (Belarusian) support for Russia’s aggression. New intelligence reviewed by US officials suggests that a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines last year, the New York Times has reported. There was no evidence that president Volodymyr Zelenskiy or his top lieutenants in Ukraine were involved in the operation, or that the perpetrators were acting at the direction of any Ukrainian government officials, the newspaper reported, citing US officials. The report said officials who reviewed the intelligence said no American or British nationals were involved and believed the saboteurs were most likely Ukrainian or Russian nationals or a combination of the two. Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the Ukrainian Presidency, has said 130 prisoners of war have been returned home following an exchange. “We managed to return home 130 of our people - 126 defenders and 4 defenders. I am proud of the entire team that worked long and hard on this exchange,” Yermak wrote on Twitter. Earlier we reported that 90 Russian prisoners of war were returned by Ukraine, according to Russia’s ministry of defence. Russia has sustained “20,000 to 30,000 casualties'’ - killed and wounded - in trying to capture Bakhmut, western officials estimated at a briefing on Tuesday. While no firm figure was offered for Ukrainian losses, the official said it was “significantly less”. The official speculated that a high proportion of those casualties, many of which will be prisoners recruited by Wagner, could have been killed. “The death rates of Wagner has been significantly higher than the Russian armed forces,” they said, which have been estimated at three wounded to one killed. The figures are crude estimates and impossible to verify, but if broadly accurate would mean that Russia may have sustained more casualties than the US did in 20 years of operations in Afghanistan, where a little less than 21,000 were killed and wounded. The officials said they believed that Ukraine is still able to hold and resupply its military in Bakhmut, although the city is surrounded from three sides and said the defenders could “last for another month” - or chose to make a tactical withdrawal “within a week”. But the course of the long-running battle remained uncertain, they added. Russia’s ministry of defence has issued a statement to say that 90 prisoners of war have been returned by Ukraine. On its official Telegram channel, it posted: As a result of the negotiation process, 90 Russian servicemen who were in mortal danger were returned from the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime Airplanes of the military transport aviation of the Russian aerospace forces will transport the released servicemen to Moscow for treatment and rehabilitation at medical institutions of the Russian defence ministry. All those released are provided with the necessary medical and psychological assistance. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister told regional media on Tuesday that fewer than 4,000 civilians, including 38 children remain in Bakhmut. “Approximately 38 children, as far as we know, remain in Bakhmut today,” AFP quotes Iryna Vereshchuk saying. The city, the focus of fierce fighting in the Donbas region, had an estimated prewar population of about 70,000 people. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine is committed to defending the embattled city despite a partial encirclement, and there are conflicting reports about the state of the defence of the city. Jan Gagin, an adviser to the Russian-installed leaders in the occupied portion of Donetsk, has claimed that Russian forces control about half of Bakhmut, while Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner mercenary group whose troops are spearheading the attack, has said that between 12,000 and 20,000 Ukrainian troops remain defending it. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said on Tuesday the seizure of Bakhmut would allow Moscow’s forces to mount further offensive operations. Agence France-Presse is carrying some comments it attributes to founder of the Wagner mercenary group Yevgeny Prigozhin. It reports that Prigozhin would not comment on defence minister Sergei Shoigu’s earlier remarks that the capture of the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut was key to launching a further offensive in the wider region. In remarks carried by his press service, Prigozhin urged against “putting the cart before the horse, saying that we have taken Bakhmut and what will happen after”. He estimated that between “12,000 and 20,000” Ukrainian troops were still defending the city. “It is very complicated to kill between 12,000-20,000 Ukrainian soldiers by tomorrow morning. Such masters only exist in the depths of the general staff or at Soyuzmultfilm,” he said, referring to the Russian cartoon studio founded in the Soviet era. Prigozhin also said that he “had not met” Shoigu in Bakhmut, where Prigozhin claims to have gone himself. The defence minister was in occupied areas of Ukraine at the weekend, including Mariupol. On television this morning in Russia, Shoigu said Bakhmut “is an important defensive hub for Ukrainian troops in Donbas” and that “capturing it will allow for further offensive operations deep into the defence lines of the Ukrainian armed forces.” A court in Moscow sentenced a student activist to eight and a half years in prison for social media posts criticizing Russia’s war in Ukraine. Dmitry Ivanov was convicted on Tuesday of spreading false information about the Russian army, AP reports. The situation is “stable and controlled” in the Luhansk region the governor, Serhiy Haidai said. In a post on Telegram, Haidai said the number of attacks in the direction of Bilogorivka and Kreminnaya had increased. Today, he said, the Russians have “pulled back to replenish their reserves”.

Thousands of people in Ukraine have sustained complex injuries linked to the war and need rehabilitation services and equipment to help them, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official has said. Attacks on healthcare facilities, fewer healthcare workers due to displacement and power shortages were making it difficult for people to get care, according to Satish Mishra from the WHO’s regional office for Europe, Reuters reports. Even before the war, in 2019, about half the population in Ukraine could have benefited from rehabilitation services for non-communicable conditions such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, Cathal Morgan, another WHO official said. Since then, the Covid-19 pandemic and the war have significantly increased the need for rehab services, he added. “Hence the need for urgency.” An update from the Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh: A court in Moscow has sentenced a student activist to eight and a half years in prison for social media posts criticising Russia’s war in Ukraine. Dmitry Ivanov was convicted on Tuesday of spreading false information about the Russian army, AP reports. That was made a criminal offence under a new law Russian lawmakers rubber-stamped a week after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine. Ivanov was charged over a number of posts in his Telegram channel that called Russia’s campaign in Ukraine a “war” and talked about Russian forces attacking civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, committing war crimes in the Kyiv suburbs of Bucha and Irpin, and targeting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Most were reposts from other sources. The legislation has been used to prosecute individuals who deviate from the government’s official narrative of the conflict that the Kremlin insists on calling “a special military operation.” Prominent opposition politicians, such as Ilya Yashin, who is serving an eight-and-a-half-year prison term, and Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is in jail awaiting trial, also were charged with spreading false information about the military. The situation is “stable and controlled” in the Luhansk region the governor, Serhiy Haidai, has said. In a post on Telegram, Haidai said the number of attacks in the direction of Bilohorivka and Kreminna had increased. Today, he said, the Russians have “pulled back to replenish their reserves”. Freshly mobilised Russians are demotivated when their commanders abandon them, when they see the real number of losses of the Russian army, as well as the conditions in which they found themselves at the front. Haidai added: The Russians in the occupied territories treat the local population even more aggressively – they take out their anger on civilians due to the lack of success at the front. The United Nations secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, will meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Wednesday to discuss extending a deal with Moscow that allows the Black Sea export of Ukraine grains amid Russia’s war in the country, Reuters reports. “The secretary-general has just arrived in Poland on his way to Ukraine,” UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Tuesday, adding that Guterres will discuss the continuation of the deal “in all its aspects and other pertinent issues.” Here are some of the latest pictures from Ukraine sent to us over the news wires. A 14-year-old Ukrainian girl who died after she was found unconscious on a beach in south Devon on Saturday has been named as Albina Yevko, Sky News reports, citing a police statement. The teenager was found on Dawlish town beach, near where she was living, on Saturday evening after a search involving a police helicopter and HM Coastguard. She was airlifted to the Royal Devon and Exeter hospital where she died. Formal identification has taken place and her next of kin have been informed, according to Devon and Cornwall police. Albina’s mother, Inna Yevko, said: Myself and my family are devastated to have lost our beautiful Albina. Nothing can ever replace her in our hearts. We ask that our privacy is respected at this incredibly painful time. DI Becky Davies said: “Our investigation continues as we try to piece together Albina’s final hours. Officers continue to undertake door-to-door inquiries as we try to identify any witnesses or CCTV footage that capture Albina’s movements. While this death remains unexplained, we are not currently treating it as suspicious. Ukraine has named the unarmed prisoner of war who appeared to have been shot dead by Russian soldiers, as the president delivered an overnight message resolving to “find the murderers”. In the graphic 12-second clip that first circulated on Telegram on Monday and was widely shared on Twitter, a detained combatant, named by the Ukrainian military as Tymofiy Mykolayovych Shadura, is seen standing in a shallow trench smoking a cigarette. The soldier, in uniform with a Ukrainian flag insignia on his arm, says “Glory to Ukraine” and is then apparently shot with automatic weapons. Read more from Lorenzo Tondo and Pjotr Sauer here: Ukraine’s military on Tuesday identified a soldier who it said was shot dead by “Russian invaders” in a video spread on social media, and hailed him as a hero whose death would be avenged. In a Facebook post, the 30th Mechanized Brigade named the man as Tymofiy Shadura. Reuters reports. It said he had been missing since 3 February after hostilities around the eastern city of Bakhmut, the scene of some of the heaviest fighting of the war in Ukraine. “According to preliminary information, the deceased is a serviceman of the 30th separate mechanized brigade, Tymofiy Mykolayovych Shadura,” the brigade’s Facebook post said. Formal confirmation would be made once his body was returned from territory occupied by Russian forces, said the brigade, which is part of Ukraine’s Ground Forces. The claims have not been independently verified. On Monday Ukraine urged the international criminal court to investigate the footage circulating on social media that appeared to show Russian fighters killing a Ukrainian prisoner of war. In the graphic clip that first circulated on Telegram, a detained combatant is seen standing in a shallow trench and smoking a cigarette. The soldier says “Glory to Ukraine” and is then apparently shot with automatic weapons. Poland is to send more tanks to Ukraine this week, the country’s defence minister said on Tuesday. “Four (tanks) are already in Ukraine, another 10 will go to Ukraine this week,” Mariusz Blaszczak told a news conference. Poland had promised to send 14 Leopard 2 tanks in total. Giving a speech to the Human Rights Council, the UN’s high commissioner for human rights, Volker Turk, has said that the scale of civilian deaths and destruction in the Ukraine war is “shocking”, Reuters reports. Belarus has detained what it described as a “terrorist” and more than 20 accomplices working with Ukrainian and U.S. intelligence services over attempted sabotage at a Belarusian airfield, Reuters cited president Alexander Lukashenko as saying. Belarusian anti-government activists said last month they had blown up a sophisticated Russian military surveillance aircraft in a drone attack at an airfield near the Belarusian capital Minsk, a claim disputed by Moscow and Minsk. “The Security Service of Ukraine, the leadership of the CIA, behind closed doors, are carrying out an operation against the Republic of Belarus. A terrorist was trained,” the Belta news agency quoted Lukashenko as saying. Lukashenko said the aircraft had suffered only superficial damage in the attack, which was carried out using a “small drone”. The suspect detained over the attack against the Beriev A-50 surveillance plane is a dual Russian-Ukrainian national, Belta also quoted Lukashenko as saying. A decision on a permanent deployment of a German brigade to Lithuania will be “up to NATO”, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Tuesday in response to calls by Vilnius for a larger NATO presence in the country. Since 2017, Germany has led an international battalion with some 1,500 troops in Lithuania as part of a NATO effort to deter Russia from attacking the Baltic region, Reuters reports. Speaking to reporters at Pabrade training ground in Lithuania, Pistorius said: This not down to who wants what - or who wants to provide what - but rather up to NATO. Here are some of the latest pictures from Ukraine sent to us over the news wires. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that the seizure of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine would allow Moscow’s forces to mount further offensive operations.

Jan Gagin, an adviser to the Russian-installed leaders in the occupied portion of Donetsk, has claimed that Russian forces control about half of Bakhmut and have control over all the asphalt roads in the area. None of the claims about the situation in Bakhmut have been independently verified. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine is committed to defending the embattled city despite a partial encirclement. The Ukrainian president said he had held a meeting with senior generals and commanders in which it was resolved that there was “no part of Ukraine” that “can be abandoned”. Ukraine’s ongoing defence of Bakhmut is forcing Russian to engage in a costly battle for a city that “isn’t intrinsically important operationally or strategically”, according to the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Zelenskiy paid tribute to a soldier whose execution by machine gun was filmed and uploaded to social media. The graphic video shows a man smoking a cigarette who says “glory to Ukraine” before he is shot at what appears to be close range. Ukraine has started online talks with partners on extending the Black Sea grain initiative aimed at ensuring Kyiv can keep shipping grain to global markets, a senior Ukrainian government source has said on Tuesday. The source said Ukraine had not held discussions with Russia, which blockaded Ukrainian Black Sea ports after its invasion last year, but that it was Kyiv’s understanding that its partners were talking to Moscow. A Moscow court has sentenced the student activist Dmitry Ivanov to eight and a half years in prison as the Kremin escalates its crackdown on anti-war dissent. Belarus detained on Tuesday what it said was a Ukrainian “terrorist group” working with Kyiv’s intelligence services over attempted sabotage at a Belarusian airfield. Belarusian anti-government activists said last month they had blown up a sophisticated Russian military surveillance aircraft in a drone attack at an airfield near the Belarusian capital Minsk, a claim disputed by Moscow and Minsk. The Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol in Crimea has denied reports that explosions have been heard near Belbek airbase. Mikhail Razvozhaev posted to Telegram to say “The public is again writing about some kind of explosion near the airfield. This is a lie. Ship crews are training in the outer road. Everything is calm in the city.” China’s foreign minister Qin Gang says the country must strengthen its relationship with Russia in the face of continued hostility from the US. In a fiery press conference, his first appearance as foreign minister, Qin outlined China’s foreign policy agenda for the coming years, presenting its relationship with Russia as a beacon of strength and stability, and the US and its allies as a source of tension and conflict. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Geneva Abdul will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Reuters is carrying further quotes from the leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, about the attempted sabotage of a Russian military plane at an airfield near Minsk last month. He has claimed that more than 20 people involved in the incident have been arrested so far. Citing the Belta news agency, Reuters reports Lukashenko said “The security service of Ukraine, the leadership of the CIA, behind closed doors, are carrying out an operation against the Republic of Belarus. A terrorist was trained.” Lukashenko said the aircraft had suffered only superficial damage in the attack, which was carried out using a “small drone”. The suspect detained over the attack against the Beriev A-50 surveillance plane is a dual Russian-Ukrainian national, Belta also quoted Lukashenko as saying. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that the seizure of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine would allow Moscow’s forces to mount further offensive operations. Shoigu also said the west was increasing its arms deliveries to Ukraine, but vowed they would not change the course of events on the battlefield. “The liberation of Artemovsk continues,” Reuters reports Shoigu said in televised remarks, using the Soviet-era name for Bakhmut. Pjotr Sauer reports for the Guardian on the detention of Dmitry Ivanov: A Moscow court has sentenced the student activist Dmitry Ivanov to eight and a half years in prison as the Kremin escalates its crackdown on anti-war dissent. Ivanov, 23, a pro-democracy activist and computer science student who runs the “Protest at MGU” [Moscow State University] Telegram channel, was tried on charges of spreading false information meant to discredit the Russian army, under a law introduced after Russia launched its invasion. In a courtroom speech shortly before the sentencing was announced, Ivanov said: “Peace to Ukraine, freedom to Russia! My example should not scare you. We have to do a lot to live in the country we deserve and to end this war.” “You must understand that Russia is not Putin. Tens of millions of Russians are against this criminal war … This is a dark moment in our history, but it is always darkest before dawn,” Ivanov added. Ivanov was part of a small group of vocal anti-war activists who had stayed behind following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine despite the growing threat of arrests. Speaking to the Guardian last year, Ivanov vowed to continue to organise protests against Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. “I don’t think I should be afraid or run away. This is my country,” he said at the time. Ivanov now joins a growing group of other prominent dissenters who have been imprisoned for speaking out against the war, including opposition politicians Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza Belarus detained on Tuesday what it said was a Ukrainian “terrorist group” working with Kyiv’s intelligence services over attempted sabotage at a Belarusian airfield, Reuters reports, citing the Belta news agency. Belarusian anti-government activists said last month they had blown up a sophisticated Russian military surveillance aircraft in a drone attack at an airfield near the Belarusian capital Minsk, a claim disputed by Moscow and Minsk. Footage shared on social media appeared to show the lead up to the attack, with a drone approaching the Russian military Airborne Warning And Control System (Awacs) plane while it was on the ground. Reuters reports that a Russian court on Tuesday sentenced the founder of an opposition Telegram channel, Dmitry Ivanov, to more than eight years in prison on charges of disseminating false information about Russia’s armed forces. Ukraine has started online talks with partners on extending the Black Sea grain initiative aimed at ensuring Kyiv can keep shipping grain to global markets, a senior Ukrainian government source has said on Tuesday. The source said Ukraine had not held discussions with Russia, which blockaded Ukrainian Black Sea ports after its invasion last year, but that it was Kyiv’s understanding that its partners were talking to Moscow. “The situation with negotiations is rather complicated. Now a lot depends not on us but on the partners,” said the source, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The Black Sea grain initiative was brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July and was extended in November. It is due to expire on 18 March unless an extension is agreed. Yuriy Vaskov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of restoration, told Reuters last month that Kyiv would ask all sides to start talks on extending the deal by at least one year and that Ukraine wanted the city of Mykolaiv’s ports included. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said last week that Ankara was working hard to extend the initiative while Russia had signalled it was unhappy with aspects of the deal. Moscow has said it will agree to extend the Black Sea grain deal only if the interests of its own agricultural producers are taken into account. Russia’s state-owned Tass quotes Jan Gagin, an adviser to the Russian-installed leaders in the occupied portion of Donetsk, as saying that Russian forces control about half of Bakhmut. According to the report, he says: Our artillery, our equipment and our troops are already in the city. They control almost half of Bakhmut. I do not rule out attempts [by Ukrainian forces] to break through in order to try to keep it, and breakouts from the city itself, there is a chaotic retreat of small groups. Tass reports that Gagin claimed that “asphalt roads in the area are already completely under the fire control of the Russian forces”. The exact military position in Bakhmut remains unclear, and Gagin’s claims have not been independently verified. An air alert has been declared across Ukraine. Here are some of the latest pictures from Ukraine sent to us over the news wires. The Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol in Crimea has denied reports that explosions have been heard near Belbek airbase. Russian state-owned media Tass quotes Mikhail Razvozhaev’s Telegram channel, where he has posted: The public is again writing about some kind of explosion near the airfield. This is a lie. Ship crews are training in the outer road. Everything is calm in the city. Sevastopol is in Crimea, which the Russian Federation annexed in 2014, in a move not widely recognised internationally. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports on its Telegram channel for Sumy that Bilopillia, a city in the north-east of Ukraine, close to the border with Russia, has been hit by mortar fire this morning. No damage or casualties were reported. The claim has not been independently verified. Russian forces carried out 50 airstrikes and five missile strikes overnight and Ukrainian forces repelled 37 attacks in the area around Bakhmut, according to the latest update by the General staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. Ukrainian forces carried out 15 airstrikes against Russian forces, including a strike on an anti-aircraft system. It also claimed to have shot down an SU-25 aircraft, nine Shaheed drones and eight other drones. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russia’s FSB security services claim to have “neutralised” two men they claim attempted to carry out a car bombing on Russian businessman Konstantin Malofeyev. Malofeyev is a media baron and owner of the ultra-conservative Tsargrad TV. He has supported Russia-backed separatists in Ukraine and trumpeted Moscow’s invasion as a “holy war.” He has been sanctioned by the US and was last year charged with trying to evade sanctions. A video was released showing what the FSB claims was the attempt to plant the bomb, with the agency blaming the commander of the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), which claims to be part of Ukraine’s armed forces. The Ukraine government did not immediately comment on the claims. The incident comes a week after an armed group with the right-wing RVC crossed into Bryansk from Ukraine and engaged in a gun battle in which the FSB said two civilians were killed and two others wounded. - with AP and Reuters Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang says China must strengthen its relationship with Russia in the face of continued hostility from the US. In a fiery press conference, his first appearance as foreign minister, on the sidelines of the “two sessions” political gathering on Tuesday, Qin outlined China’s foreign policy agenda for the coming years, presenting its relationship with Russia as a beacon of strength and stability, and the US and its allies as a source of tension and conflict. Qin said the US side claimed that it wanted to outcompete China but didn’t seek conflict “but in reality, the US side’s so-called competition is all-out containment and suppression, a zero-sum game where you die and I live. Qin defended the close friendship between China and Russia, a relationship closely watched by the west in light of the war in Ukraine. He said the ties between Beijing and Moscow “set an example for global foreign relations”. With China and Russia working together, the world will have a driving force. The more unstable the world becomes the more imperative it is for China and Russia to steadily advance their relations. He said there was “close contact” between the leadership of the two countries, with “head of state” relations forming the anchor of the relationship. “The strategic partnership … will surely grow from strength to strength.” For more read the full story by Guardian reporter Helen Davidson in Taipei. The ISW also says the destruction of Wagner as an organised fighting group would have “positive ramifications beyond the battlefield”. During the last nine months in which the organisation has been involved in assaulting Bakhmut, the ISW says the Wagner Group has “ostentatiously ramped up efforts to disseminate Wagner’s militarism and ideology throughout Russia”. Wagner’s existence as an independent fighting force separate from the Russian military has mean Yevgeny Prigozhin has been considered a potential future challenger to Russian resident Vladimir Putin, which the ISW speculates is why his force is being set up for failure. Badly damaging Prigozhin’s power and reputation within Russia would be an important accomplishment from the standpoint of the long-term prospects for restoring sanity in Russia. That is an aim in America’s interests as well as in Ukraine’s, and it raises the stakes in the Battle of Bakhmut beyond matters of terrain and battlespace geometry. Wagner Group members were allegedly responsible for the murder of Yevgeny Nuzhin, a returned Russian POW who was executed with a sledgehammer after he defected to Ukraine then volunteered to return to Russia in a prisoner swap. Ukraine’s ongoing defence of the besieged city of Bakhmut is forcing Russian to engage in a costly battle for a city that “isn’t intrinsically important operationally or strategically”, according to the Institute of Study of War (ISW). In its latest update released on Tuesday the ISW says the city has become “strategically significant [for Ukraine] due to the current composition of Russian forces there.” It says that while there is a risk Ukraine is “expending its own elite manpower and scarce equipment on mainly Wagner prison recruits who are mere cannon fodder” it suggests the large numbers of convicts Wagner has recruited is “not limitless” and “the permanent elimination of tens of thousands of them in Bakhmut means that they will not be available for more important fights”. The ISW also added that Wagner has drawn upon its “elite elements” which have been supported by Russian airborne units. The opportunity to damage the Wagner Group’s elite elements, along with other elite units if they are committed, in a defensive urban warfare setting where the attrition gradient strongly favors Ukraine is an attractive one. Recent statements from Wager Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin about concerns over a lack of ammunition suggest he fears his forces are being sacrificed “to the last man” by the Russian Ministry of Defence, the ISW says. Maps released by the Institute for Study of War showing ground movements as of Monday suggest Russian forces have taken 40% of Bakhmut after a nine-month-long campaign. The developments come after Volodymyr Zelenskiy committed Ukrainian armed forces to defend the besieged city amidst conditions one commander has described as “hell on earth”. Earlier on Monday the ISW suggested Russian forces would not be able to capitalise on any gains even if they were to capture the city and that Ukraine’s defence was creating conditions for a future counteroffensive. Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskiy’s vow to defend Bakhmut following a meeting with senior military officials may be at odds with the developing situation on the ground. Michael Kofman, director of studies at the CAN think tank in Arlington Virginia, and one of the few observers to have correctly called Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine, said on Sunday that a continued defence of Bakhmut “doesn’t plan to Ukraine’s advantage as a force”. In follow up comments posted to social media, Kofman said the ongoing defence of Bakhmut may prove costly if Ukraine intends to engage in a counteroffensive in the coming months. It is a situation Zelenskiy himself appeared to acknowledge less than a week ago when he said he was contemplating a retreat from Bakhmut after a nine-month siege to allow Ukrainian forces to regroup in better-reinforced positions. The Ukrainian president has doubled down on the defence of Bakhmut despite rumours of an imminent retreat from the besieged city that has endured a nine-month assault. During his evening address on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had met senior generals where they indicated their support for continuing the defence. I told the chief of staff to find the appropriate forces to help the guys in Bakhmut. There is no part of Ukraine about which one can say that it can be abandoned. After a series of meetings with Zelenskiy, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, “spoke in favour of continuing the defensive operation and further strengthening [Ukrainian] positions in Bakhmut”, Zelenskiy’s office said. For more on this story, read the full report by Lorenzo Tondo. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine – this is Royce Kurmelovs bringing you the latest developments. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has committed to defending the embattled city of Bakhmut despite a partial encirclement. Zelenskiy said he had discussed the situation with his chief of the general staff and commander of ground forces who backed “continuing the defensive operation”. In his nightly address the president said there was “no part of Ukraine” that “can be abandoned”. In his first media appearance as foreign minister China’s Qin Gang has defended the close friendship between China and Russia, a relationship closely watched by the west in light of the war in Ukraine. He said the ties between Beijing and Moscow “set an example for global foreign relations”. Both Kyiv and Moscow appear to be struggling with ammunition shortages and mounting casualties. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, which is leading the Russian offensive in Bakhmut, said that his representative had been denied access to the headquarters of Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine after Prigozhin repeatedly complained about a lack of ammunition. Zelenskiy paid tribute to a soldier whose execution by machine gun was filmed and uploaded to social media. The graphic video shows a man smoking a cigarette who says “glory to Ukraine” before he is shot at what appears to be close range. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense says it has identified three Russian soldiers allegedly responsible for shooting an evacuation convoy in Irpin in March 2022. Nine civilians died during the attack with twelve others wounded. The shooters served with the 173rd separate reconnaissance battalion and two soldiers from the 137th guards paratrooper regiment. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has visited Mariupol in a rare trip to occupied Ukraine by a senior Moscow figure. The Russian defence ministry issued images on Monday of Shoigu “inspecting Russian reconstruction efforts of infrastructure”. Russia’s FSB security service claims to have thwarted a car bomb attack on Russian nationalist businessman Konstantin Malofeyev. The FSB blamed the Russian Volunteer Corps, which claims to be part of Ukraine’s armed forces. The Ukrainian government has not responded to questions about the incident. The exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has been handed a 15-year jail term after being convicted in absentia for treason and “conspiracy to seize power”. She said the verdict was punishment for her efforts to promote democracy. The European Union is reported to be edging closer to joint procurement of ammunition to help Ukraine and replenish members’ stockpiles. Major questions regarding funding and scale remain to be resolved in what would be a landmark move. Russia’s premier tank force is expected to be re-equipped with Soviet-made T-62 tanks first fielded in 1954 to make up for combat losses, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. The MoD said there was a “realistic” possibility” that the 60-year-old tanks would be supplied to units that had been expected to receive the next-generation T-14 Armata main battle tank. Russia’s prosecutor general has said it is labelling German-based anti-corruption group Transparency International an “undesirable organisation”. “It was found that the activities of this organisation clearly go beyond the declared goals and objectives,” it said. A British-led £520m international fund to provide fresh weapons for Ukraine and intended to be “low bureaucracy” has been plagued by delays, with only £200m allocated amid warnings that the rest of the funding will not provide arms at the front “until the summer”. Most of Ukraine’s winter grain crops – winter wheat and barley – are in good condition and could produce a good harvest, Ukraine’s academy of agricultural science has been quoted as saying."

                    "bodyText": "Time to recap America’s top central banker has warned that the Federal Reserve is prepared to switch back to bigger interest rate rises to fight inflation, if necessary. Fed chair Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that the central bank has “more work to do”, even though the full effects of its tightening have not been felt yet. Powell told senators that interest rates are likely to peak higher than previously thought, given the strength of the US economy. Powell says: The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes. The markets now estimate there is over a 50% chance that the Fed lifts interest rates by half a percentage point later month, having slowed to quarter-point rises in its last two meetings. These comments hit US bond prices, driving up the yield on two-year Treasury bills to almost 5%, the highest level since 2007. The pound is sliding against the US dollar, hitting a two-month low around $1.186 tonight, down over a cent and a half. Shares on Wall Street have fallen, pulling the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by around 1%. In other news…..

Phew. Shares have fallen in New York too, as traders respond to Jerome Powell’s hawkish comments about the need to keep raising interest rates to tackle inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed 292 points, or 0.9%, to 33,138 points. Almost all the 30 companies on the index are in the red, led by Walgreens Boots Alliance (-2.1%) and JPMorgan Chase (-2%). The broader S&amp;P 500 index has lost 1%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq is down 0.75%. US government bond prices have dropped after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell hinted strongly that US interest rates will be hiked higher. This has driven up the yield, or interest rate, on two-year Treasury bills to 4.95%, the highest since 2007 – just before the credit crunch. That’s a clear sign that investors are anticipating a large increase in US interest rates this month, of perhaps half a percentage point, given Powell’s concerns about inflation and his warning that there is “more work to do”. The gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, which is seen as an indicator of economic expectations, was at a negative 98.7 basis points, Reuters points out. Such an inversion is seen as a reliable recession indicator. In his testimony today, Fed chair Powell has confirmed that rates will peak higher than expected, says Andrew Hunter, deputy chief US economist at Capital Economics. Hunter says: Fed Chair Jerome Powell appears to have confirmed today that interest rates are set to rise a higher than we previously anticipated. But with most evidence still pointing to economic weakness and lower inflation this year, we still suspect the Fed will begin cutting rates again sooner than the markets are now expecting. Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot, cautions that the markets got carried away by predictingthat the Fed would ‘pivot’ away from higher rates soon. “As the economic data continues to paint a US economy in rude health, it has become clear that markets got somewhat ahead of themselves on talks of interest rate pauses and potential pivots to rate cuts. Jerome Powell has poured cold water on the idea that Fed is ready to change tack and reiterated the need for bigger interest rate rises if they are required. “Indeed, data has shown that while inflation peaked at the end of last year, its downward trajectory has not been quite as swift as market participants would have liked. This sticky inflation means interest rate rises will remain on the table for as long as employment remains robust. The market is hearing the ‘higher for longer’ message loud and clear and doesn’t see the Fed being dissuaded, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com So, Fed will go higher and for longer – but also might get to what it thinks the peak might be at a swifter pace. Think we see 50bps very much back on the table for the next couple of meetings – the potential to increase the pace of tightening again is noteworthy and probably the chief cause of the market reaction - bonds had kinda already accepted higher and longer. Samuel Fuller, Director of Financial Markets Online, agrees that chair Powell has given a clear signal that US interest rates will rise higher: “Central bankers often have a habit of talking in code. Not today. Jerome Powell couldn’t have been clearer - the Federal Reserve isn’t just willing to pump up US interest rates further, it’s planning to do so. “With US inflation falling but only slowly, the Fed’s Chair warned Congress of the dangers of easing monetary tightening too soon, and pledged to ‘stay the course until the job is done’. Powell admits that the Fed’s tools are powerful but blunt, as he outlines the challenge of bringing down core inflation in the services sector. He says we have not seen the full effects of the Fed’s recent rate hikes – which raised borrowing costs by 4.5 percentage points over the past year, so policymakers are watching carefully for ‘lags in monetary policy’. We are very focused on core inflation, the Fed chair explains. The dollar continues to rally as traders reprice their expectations for how fast, and how high, US interest rates could be hiked. This has pushed sterling down by a cent and a half today, to $1.187, the lowest since January 6th. Powell also had advice for Congress – it must raise the debt ceiling, or risk longstanding harm. Last month the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warned the US Treasury department will exhaust its ability to pay all its bills sometime between July and September, unless the current $31.4tn cap on borrowing is raised or suspended. Jerome Powell insists to Congress that the Fed can, and will, bring inflation down to the 2% target. Powell says the Fed is watching the crypto space closely, due to the turmoil in the sector recently. Jerome Powell is now explaining to the Senate banking committee that there is still a mismatch between supply and demand. This is visible in the goods sector, and also in the jobs market (where there were 11m vacancies at the end of last year). The financial markets now believe there is a greater than 50% chance that the Fed increases the size of its interest rate rises this month, and votes for a half-point hike: Jerome Powell rounds off his prepared testimony to Congress by warning of the risks of relaxing monetary policy too quickly. He says that bringing down inflation is essential to achieving the Fed’s two goals, of price stability and maximum employment: Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done. America’s top central banker is warning Congress that more needs to be done to tame US inflation, sending the dollar rallying against the pound. Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, is testifying to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. And he begins by warning that the Fed has “more work to do” – a hint that interest rates will continue to rise. Powell says: We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do. Our policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all. Powell explains to the committee that inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year but [at 6.4% in January] remains well above the Fed’s longer-run objective of 2%. On the economic picture, he says the US economy slowed significantly last year, and points to signs that consumer spending and production are subdued. But with inflation still three times the Fed’s target, Powell warns that the Fed continues to anticipate that ongoing interest rate increases will be appropriate, to return inflation to 2 percent over time. For the last two meetings, the Fed has slowed the pace of its interest rate increases to 25 basis points, or a quarter of one percent. Today, though, Powell wans that larger hikes could be introduced if necessary. He points out that recent latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. Powell says: If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes. This has sent the dollar rising, knocking the pound down by over one cent today to $1.189. The UK’s National Grid has decided against triggering its Demand Flexibility Service tomorrow, which would have paid some households with smart meters to use less energy at peak times to avoid blackouts due to the cold weather. Demonstrators have marched across France today in a new round of protests and strikes against the government’s plan to raise the retirement age to 64. Unions have been hoping to make their biggest show of force against the proposed pensions reform, disrupting fuel deliveries and public transport and bringing the country to a standstill. The proposed changes would raise the minimum retirement age to 64 from 62 and increase the number of years people have to make contributions for a full pension. Associated Press reports: Garbage collectors, utility workers, train drivers and others have walked off the job on Tuesday across France to show their anger at the reform. More than 250 protests were expected in Paris and around the country against President Emmanuel Macron’s showcase legislation. The bill is under debate in the French Senate this week. Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Paris, Marseille, Nice and other cities, including Nantes and Lyon where some minor clashes with police broke out. Laurent Berger, the secretary-general of the CFDT union, said that based on initial figures, the numbers of demonstrators nationwide are expected to be the biggest since the beginning of the movement in January. The board of the International Monetary Funs is close to approving a $2.9bn bailout for Sri Lanka. The rescue package could be agreed on 20 March, 10 months after Sri Lanka defaulted on its debts for the first time. Reuters has the details: The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday said Sri Lanka has secured financing assurances from all major bilateral creditors, paving the way for the IMF board to consider approval of a long-awaited $2.9 billion four-year bailout agreed last year. The IMF said its board will meet on March 20 to review a preliminary staff-level agreement first signed in September, offering a lifeline to the South Asian country which faces its worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. Approval is expected since the board generally will not add items to its agenda unless its members are ready to act. Sri Lanka has now received financing assurances from all major bilateral creditors,” Krishna Srinivasan, director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department (APD) said in a statement. “This paves the way for consideration by the IMF’s Board on March 20 the approval of the Staff Level Agreement reached on September 1, 2022 for financing under an Extended Fund Facility,” Srinivasan added. Speaking of the energy industry… new analysis has found that a publicly owned electricity generation firm could save Britons nearly £21bn a year. The work. by Thinktank Common Wealth, bolsters Labour’s case to launch a national energy company if the party gains power. My colleague Alex Lawson explains: The Common Wealth report, which analysed scenarios for reforming the electricity market, said that a huge saving on electricity costs could be made by buying out assets such as wind, solar and biomass generators on older contracts and running them on a non-profit basis. Funding the measure could require a government bond issuance, or some form of compulsory purchase process. Last year the government attempted to get companies operating low carbon generators, including nuclear power plants, on older contracts to switch to contracts for difference (CfD), allowing any outsized profits to flow back to taxpayers. However, the government later decided to tax eligible firms through the electricity generator levy instead. The Common Wealth study concluded that a publicly owned low carbon energy generator would best deliver on Britain’s climate and economic goals, would eliminate windfall profits made by generators and would cut household bills. Here are more details: The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded action against fossil fuel companies who engage in greenwashing to improve their reputation. Volker Türk told the 52nd session of the Human Rights Council that “Fake climate solutions” must be called out. He say the next UN climate change conference, which begins at the end of November, must tackle the issue. Türk says: I deplore the attempts by the fossil fuel industry at global climate talks and elsewhere to greenwash their reputation and derail our goal of decarbonization. This must be averted at the upcoming COP28 in Dubai, and we need inclusive, safe and meaningful participation of civil society. A study last month found that accusations of greenwashing against major oil companies that claim to be in transition to clean energy are well-founded. While mentions of “climate”, “low-carbon” and “transition” have risen sharply in annual reports in recent years, there has been fewer concrete actions towards moving away from fossil fuels, it found. Türk also called for protection of those who raise concerns over environmental crimes, or policies that result in harm, saying: Bashing climate protests; designing laws that unfairly restrict activities that call the public’s attention to climate harms; and allowing attacks on activists to go unpunished: these are tactics that harm all States and all human beings. And they need to be addressed, urgently. The political and financial turmoil last autumn may have deterred some foreign companies from acquiring UK companies. The total value of inward M&amp;A dropped to £5.3bn in the final quarter of 2023, new data from the Office from National Statistics shows. That is almost £16bn lower than in July-September when inward M&amp;A was worth £21.2bn. A year ago, inward M&amp;A into the UK totalled £16.3bn. The number of inward M&amp;A transactions was broadly unchanged between October (68) and November (64), before dropping to 38 transactions during December 2022. The turmoil of the mini-budget at the end of September, followed by the change of prime minister and chancellor, won’t have made Britain look a particularly attractive investment opportunity: Andrew Gillen, Head of Corporate M&amp;A and Capital Markets at corporate law firm Travers Smith, says: “The sharp drop off in value and volume of inbound M&amp;A during Q4, alongside an increase in outbound M&amp;A indicates that political turmoil and economic uncertainty in the UK during autumn 2022 had a profound impact on the attractiveness of the UK as an investment destination at that time. However it is always dangerous to read too much into a single quarter’s statistics: we feel the improving economic indicators that have been seen in early ‘23, and relative political stability, boosted by closer co-operation with the EU following the Windsor Agreement, will start to reverse this impact and allow the UK market to benefit from any increase in M&amp;A activity.” Domestic M&amp;A activity, in which UK companies acquire other UK companies, almost doubled to £3.6bn in the last quarter of 2022. Elsewhere in the global economy, South Africa is on the brink of recession after the country’s power cut crisis hit growth in the last quarter of 2022. South Africa’s economy contracted by 1.3% in the final three months of last year, more than expected, as the escalation in rolling power cuts caused most sectors to shrink, including mining and agriculture. South Africa’s energy crisis has led to daily power cuts of between eight and 11 hours across the country. Offices, hospitals, factories and tens of thousands of small businesses were forced to close, with outages also causing increased crime, traffic disruption and massive wastage as food supply chains collapse. Catherine Mann also predicted that some of the older workers who took early retirement in the last couple of years may try to return to the jobs market, because they struggle to live as they’d like on their pensions. She told Bloomberg TV that it is “a challenge” to retire at 55, and make sure your retirement savings match your longevity. BoE policymaker Mann predicts that some of these early retirees will end up looking for work, saying: I worry that a couple years down the line, we’re going to see people trying to come back into the labour force, and that’s going to be much more difficult. There has been some indication that people are looking for part time positions, Mann says, adding: It’s early on that and as I say, I worry that people are going to find that their pensions are not sufficient for their preferred lifestyle and are going to want to come back. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has urged early retirees to return to work, and attracted criticism for suggesting that over-50s should get off the golf course to help tackle the UK’s labour shortages. Mann also expressed concern about the supply side of the UK economy, saying: It really is striking how slow growth is in the UK — much slower than what we observed for the US or for the euro area. Brexit is a factor on the supply side and on pricing power.” Catherine Mann says companies are in a strong position to raise prices and this might force the Bank of England to maintain high rates or even increase them further, my colleague Phillip Inman writes: Mann appears to have been blindsided by how corporate monopolies hand consumer goods companies the power to exploit a crisis by uniformly jacking up prices. In the US this trend has been dubbed greedflation. The ECB has discussed it. But seemingly not the Bank of England. On the services side of things, Brexit has limited skilled labour. You might ask how can services firms increase prices if there is intense competition. Well, the savings or inheritances of better-off people allows them to pay higher prices for everything from new kitchens and plumber callouts to higher solicitors or accounting fees. Other, less well off consumers are forced to follow suit. Bunzl’s recent results illustrate the point. It has become one of the most successful FTSE 100 companies by smuggling huge cost increases into its delivery and logistics business, pushing up the prices of all kinds of goods and services that consumers pay. Incredibly, last year it preserved profits and increased margins. This situation is most likely going to be a one-off, given inflation’s likely precipitous fall this year. But it has preserved corporate margins for the last two years and left 90% of people worse off. And BoE rate hikes have helped impoverish people further by raising the cost of borrowing. Mann has shown in speeches that she is very concerned about the labour shortages and their impact on rising wages and, in turn, prices. But it is only now dawning on policymakers that big corporates have capitalised on the crisis to increase prices even more than they needed to, boosting profits and dividends for shareholders. Mann’s answer is to raise interest rates further, even though this only punishes mortgage holders, most of them young and middle aged families, and not the rich, who now get higher rates for their savings. Catherine Mann doesn’t name and shame any companies who have been exhibiting ‘strong pricing power’, but there are plenty of examples of firms who haven’t been shy to whack up their prices. Unilever, which owns Marmite, Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream, Dove soap and Domestos bleach, lifted its prices by 11.2% last summer, and predicted further rises last month. Coca-Cola’s average selling price rose 11% during 2022, and it plans to raise prices further this year. Nestlé lifted its prices by 8.2% last year, which it says did not fully offset its rising costs, and is also planning further price increases this year. Supermarkets have been lifting their prices too, pushing grocery inflation to a record high of 17.1% last month – leaving one in four families struggling. Many broadband and mobile companies are preparing to hit customers with inflation-busting price rises of up to 17% this spring. Recent falls in UK house prices need to be put in context, Catherine Mann argued today. She pointed out to Bloomberg TV that prices have “appreciated dramatically” over the last couple of years. That has created a wealth effect which has only been slightly eroded by falls in prices since last summer. Mann says: A lot of prices have appreciated dramatically in the last couple of years. So there is some price depreciation, but it’s really not that much compared to how much prices on average appreciated over the last couple of years. So we have to take into account what the starting point was, as well as the dynamics of the current pricing. Q: So do prices have further to fall? Mann suggests that the market could be in a “revival” rather than continuing to fall. She points to the reduction in mortgage rates from the high point last autumn, and the increased competion with various lenders launching new mortgage products. As we covered this morning, Halifax reported today that prices rose by 1.1% in February, but average prices were still down around 2.9% or £8,500 on the August 2022 peak. Bank of England rate-setter Catherine Mann also warned that sterling could face downward pressure if investors have not yet fully priced in hawkish messages from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. She told Bloomberg TV: “The important question for me with regard to the pound is how much of that existing hawkish tone is already priced into the pound. If it’s already priced in, then what we see is what we get. But if it’s not completely priced in, then there could be depreciation pressure.” This has nudged the pound a little lower today, it’s down 0.1% at $1.2010. Bank of England policymaker Catherine Mann has warned that UK firms are continuing to raise prices, driving up UK inflation. Speaking to Bloomberg TV, Mann says she is concerned by the strong pricing power exhibited by firms, which many consumers have been willing to pay. She explains that the price of gas and goods imported from abroad are “on the downturn”, and not rising as fast as they did last year. But on the other hand, Mann is concerned by the extent to which firms have strong pricing powers, and the acceptance of those higher prices by many consumers. Mann says: Of course, not all but even in the face of the cost of living crisis there are still a lot of people out there who are willing to pay higher prices, and firms are willing to set their prices high. This is a growing concern among central bankers. Last week, the European Central Bank signalled it was closely monitoring potential price gouging of consumers. [The Bank of England’s mandate is to keep inflation at 2% in the medium term, but inflation has soared over that target since the summer of 2021. In January this year, consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 10.1%.] Mann, a hawkish member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee, says she feels vindicated after calling for interest rates to be raised faster in 2022, arguing that a ‘front-loaded’ policy would have been more effective in dampening inflation expectations. She argues that more monetary policy tightening needs to be done, so that inflation expectations fall. The weak pound, she says, is a “very important ingredient” pushing up inflation, as it raises the cost of imports of goods, and energy. The UK, Mann points out, is a “small open economy” which imports a lot of products. The publisher of the Daily Mirror and Express newspapers has revealed that annual profits tumbled by more than a quarter as it saw costs surge by 40% and a drop in advertising demand. Reach, which also owns the Daily Star and a raft of regional titles across the UK, posted underlying pre-tax profits down by 28% to £103.3m, PA Media reports. Underlying operating profits dropped 27% to £106.1m. It said soaring inflation – largely due to rising newsprint costs as energy bills rocketed – pushed up its operating costs by around £40m over the year and hit demand from advertisers. Reach saw ad revenues plunge 15.9% in the year to December 25, while circulation fell 1.7% with falls limited by cover price increases in the second half of 2022. Digital advertising, which has been a strong growth area for media firms, fell 2.7% in the second half of the year as the economic outlook worsened. Premier Foods has lifted its forecast for profits this year, after its grocery business saw strong demand. The maker of Mr Kipling cakes and OXO cubes said it now expected adjusted profit before tax to be around £135m for the year to April 1, 10% higher than the prior-year figure. Premier Foods also saw improving demand for its sweet treats segment improves in the fourth quarter. Shares have jumped 10% this morning. In January, the company said it would raise prices and cut spending as a way to offset high input cost inflation. UK house prices appear to be “somewhat stabilising” despite the ongoing pressure of the cost-of-living crisis on the housing market, says Charlotte Nixon, mortgage expert at Quilter: The fall in mortgage rates compared to the peak seen towards the end of last year has probably boosted buyer confidence, but this could be short-lived, Nixon warns. She predicts that interest rates will continue to rise this year, weighing on prices: Although we have hopefully passed the peak of inflation, it’s still likely that interest rates will still rise further, and the current unpredictability of the market will be concerning for homeowners who may be looking to sell their properties. “While this morning’s figures are slightly more positive than some may have expected, the high cost of energy and increased mortgage rates could see a return to falling prices over the next few months. Many homeowners are struggling to keep up with the increasing energy bills, which is causing them to cut back on their spending elsewhere. This, in turn, has decreased demand from buyers as people are hesitant to make such a significant investment in a time of financial uncertainty. In the City, shares in UK energy services company John Wood have jumped 15% after it received a fouth takeover approach from private equity firm Apollo. Wood, which had rejected three unsolicited proposals from Apollo already, received a fourth proposal for a cash offer of 237 pence per share – around 20% above last night’s close. However, the board of Wood say they believe this latest proposal still undervalues the compay, so they are “minded to reject” it. They add: The Board will continue to engage with its shareholders and intends to engage further, on a limited basis, with Apollo. There can be no certainty either that an offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any offer might be made. Further announcements will be made as appropriate. Shares have jumped to around 222p this morning, still below Apollo’s offer – but up around two-thirds so far this year. Greggs has reported that its move to open some bakeries later into the evening is paying off. Greggs extended the opening hours of 500 shops until 8pm or beyond last year, as it competed for “food-on-the-go” sales in the evening. Products such as chicken goujons and pizza slices have proved popular in the evenings, Greggs reports, including sharing boxes via its delivery service. The bakery is also excited to have gone viral on TikTok, telling shareholders: We also introduced warm versions of some of our core products, with Hot Yum Yums and salted caramel dipping sauce going viral on TikTok! Greggs also expanded its range of vegan products, saying: Whether our customers follow a vegan diet or not, we know many more people are choosing to eat less meat for ethical, environmental or health reasons, and we are meeting that need. This morning’s Halifax house price report suggets the housing market is resilient, the EY ITEM Club of economic forecasters say. The “strong gain” of 1.1% in prices last month could be a reflection of mortgage rates falling back from their post-mini-Budget peaks and a healthy labour market, argues Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. It could also be another sign that the economy is demonstrating unexpected resilience, despite the headwinds it is facing, Beck adds. But… February’s rise left annual growth in prices at a modest 2.1%, and Beck says it is hard to see “momentum in prices being maintained”. He adds: Mortgage rates have come down in the last few months but are still much higher than a year ago. Meanwhile, households’ ability to take on and service debt is being squeezed by falling real incomes, and widespread predictions of a decline in property values will likely encourage some potential buyers to delay purchasing, weighing on demand. On the other hand, changes in the structure of the housing and mortgage markets, and a resilient labour market, will likely reduce the risk of forced selling. An improving economic outlook as this year progresses may also limit how far house prices fall. National Grid has asked power plants in Great Britain to generate extra electricity tonight ahead of the coldest night of the year, my colleague Alex Lawson reports. The Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) has issued an “electricity margin notice”, telling the owners of power plants to bring on extra power supplies between 4.30pm and 8.30pm on Tuesday. National Grid stressed this did not mean supplies were “at risk”. The Met Office has issued weather warnings for rain and snow across the UK with temperatures of -4C expected in London and -6C in Birmingham. The freezing temperatures across the country are expected to trigger a surge in demand for power and heating. On Monday, National Grid asked EDF to warm up its West Burton A coal unit for potential use today. The unit is covered by one of the “winter contingency” contracts negotiated by government to keep coal fired power plants on standby for emergency use. Strikes at EDF’s nuclear power plants in France, which supplies Britain with electricity via subsea cables, have also raised concerns in recent days. The Grid has been on heightened alert over risks of potential power cuts this winter, due to concerns Russia would cut gas supplies into Europe, with a knock on effect on Britain. However, a relatively mild winter and high levels of gas storage in Europe have eased these fears, and caused gas prices to fall sharply. Late on Monday night, a spokesperson for the ESO said: “An electricity margin notice (EMN) has been issued to the market. This is a routine tool that we use most winters, and means we are asking generators to make available any additional generation capacity they may have. The EMN does not mean electricity supply is at risk.” In December, National Grid paid record amounts to encourage gas-fired power plants to crank up supply at short notice. The coal-fired plants, which also include units at Drax in Yorkshire and Uniper’s Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire, have been warmed for potential use several times this winter but stood down each time. Estate agents Foxtons has predicted that the property market will turn around later this year, as the recent fall in mortgage rates lifts the market. Foxtons told the City this morning that: Mortgage rates have started to reduce in recent weeks and buyer activity is picking up, which may result in a more favourable sales market in the latter part of the year. The average rate on fixed-rate mortgages surged over 6.5% last October, following the turmoil in the government bond market after the mini-budget. But rates have fallen since, with HSBC launching a fiveve-year fixed-rate mortgage priced at below 4% last month. Foxtons reported an 11% rise in revenues last year, while pre-tax profits more than doubled to £11.9m. Guy Gittins, who was appointed Foxtons chief executive last year, says “core operational failings have throttled historical performance” at the company. Those failings includes: Poor data accessibility and utilisation impeded business decision making and the ability to unlock revenue growth opportunities. Outdated estate agency processes and diluted culture restricted organic growth. Insufficient headcount capacity and experience constrained productivity. No clear customer proposition and brand invisible in core markets limited ability to successfully compete. Estate agents are reporting that activity has picked up this year. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, says it appears the market is stronger than expected: “The UK housing market appears near the end of a long hangover from the mini-Budget rather than on the verge of a price plunge. Activity stopped well before Christmas due to the mortgage market turmoil but has picked up this year as people come to terms with where rates are settling. That said, asking prices are likely to come under more pressure as we enter the traditionally busier spring market due to tighter affordability. We expect around half of the 20% increase seen during the pandemic to unwind but most evidence that is not backwards-looking points to a stronger market than expected.” Matthew Thompson, head of sales at London-based agency Chestertons, reports a rise in properties coming onto the market. “As the UK economy has shown signs of recovery, we are beginning to see more sellers wanting to capitalise on the positive market sentiment. In February, our branches registered a 2% increase in the number of properties being put up for sale compared to the same month last year.” “Still, the capital continues to experience a chronic undersupply of suitable housing; particularly as demand has remained strong since the start of 2023 with more buyers booking in viewings. Simultaneously, the number of offers being withdrawn has decreased by 11% which indicates that there are fewer window shoppers and more serious buyers entering the market.” North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf says Halifax’s data confirms the picture at the ‘sharp end’ of the market: ‘The reduction in housing market activity has been quite modest considering recent rises in mortgage rates and the cost-of-living shock, while a fresh crop of properties has buoyed viewings considerably and is outstripping sales agreed. ‘As a result buyers are waiting to see if prices may soften further and mortgage repayments stabilise before committing.’ But Jonathan Hopper, CEO of Garrington Property Finders, reports that uncertainty is slowing the market: “For both rattled sellers and anxious buyers, this is a tentative step in the right direction. “Prices are now settling rather than sliding, and the market remains firmly in a period of transition. The trouble is no-one yet knows what it’s transitioning to. “The Halifax’s data shows the average price of a home has now risen on a monthy basis for two months in a row, but it’s far too soon to call the end of the price correction that’s underway nearly everywhere. “The fact remains that while many buyers have both the financial ability and the opportunity to buy, they lack the confidence to do so – and as a consequence the market is still slowing. The UK property market is not ‘out of the woods’ yet, despite its pick-up in February, says Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor: Scholar explains that improvements in the underlying economic climate are lifting house prices: While annual house price growth remained steady, the monthly reading has been picking up in recent months, reflecting some improvements in the underlying drivers. Although mortgage rates are historically at high levels, they have been coming down, helping to support demand for properties. Plus the latest GfK consumer confidence reading hit the highest since April 2022, with sentiment recovering from the lows last September. The housing market however is not yet out of the woods with pressures from a weak economy, double-digit inflation, the cost-of-living crisis and the potential for further rate hikes this year from the Bank of England. This morning’s Halifax reading is markedly different to the recent report from Nationwide which saw year-on-year house prices drop by 1.1% in February, the first annual drop since the height of the pandemic in June 2020. Nationwide and Halifax use different data sources and methos when constructing the index, based on their own mortgage approvals, which could explain the discrepancy.” UK bakery chain Greggs has warned this morning that it is being pressured by rising costs. Greggs told the City that “cost inflation will continue to be a challenge in the year ahead”, driven particularly by pay awards and energy costs. Greggs has also reported a “strong performance” for 2022. Like-for-like sales at its shops jumped by 17.8% last year, while pre-tax profit rose by 1.9% to £148.3m. Earnings were held back by the rising costs of ingredients, energy, and labour. Greggs opener 186 new stores last year – a record – and closed 39, leading to net openings of 147 shops. That grew Greggs’ estate to 2,328 shops on 31 December 2022. The company is aiming for 150 net openings in 2023, and says there is a “clear opportunity for significantly more than 3,000 UK shops in time”. Halifax has also broken down the housing market by property type – which shows that prices of new houses rose over the last year, while flat prices fell. They say: By property type, prices of flats are now into negative territory over the past 12 months (-0.3% annual growth), while prices for terraced properties have broadly stagnated (+0.3%). For detached properties, these have increased by just +1.5% on the year, the lowest rise since the end of 2019. Annual price inflation remains stronger for new houses (+6.6%, a four-month high) than for existing properties (+1.1%, unchanged at the lowest in nearly a decade). Annual house price growth dropped “most significantly” in the North East, at 1.1% in February vs a rise of 3.6% in January, with homes in the region now costing an average £163,953, Halifax reports. Average house prices in London dropped by 0.9% to £526,842, from January’s £530,416. Halifax explains: London may be affected by its large proportion of flats – prices for which have broadly stagnated. Despite this slowdown, homes in London still cost over £240,000 more than the UK national average. During February, house prices rose by 2.2% over the last year in Scotland, lifting the average price to £198,779. In Wales, annual growth slowed to 1.2%, meaning average homes cost £210,917. Those purchasing a home in Northern Ireland will now pay £185,009, on average, an annual growth rate of 5.7% (vs 7.0% in January.) Good morning. UK house prices picked up last month, data just released shows, as calm returned to the property market after the turmoil of last autumn. Halifax has reported that the average house price rose by 1.1% in February, following a 0.2% increase in January and a 1.3% drop in December. This left the annual rate of house price growth unchanged, at +2.1% for third month running. But on a quarter-on-quarter basis, prices were down 2.5%. Kim Kinnaird, director at Halifax Mortgages, points out that the average house price has been stable over the last three months. The fall in mortgage costs, following the surge after the disastrous mini-budget last September, has also helped prices to stabilise, Kinnaird says: Recent reductions in mortgage rates, improving consumer confidence, and a continuing resilience in the labour market are arguably helping to stabilise prices following the falls seen in November and December. Still, with the cost of a home down on a quarterly basis, the underlying activity continues to indicate a general downward trend. In cash terms, house prices are down around £8,500 (or 2.9%) on the August 2022 peak but remain almost £9,000 above the average prices seen at the start of 2022. As the average prices are still above pre Covid-19 levels, most sellers will retain at least some of the price gains made during the pandemic. Kinnaird points out that house price affordability remains a problem for new buyers: With average house prices remaining high housing affordability will continue to feel challenging for many buyers. Halifax’s data shows a stronger market than rival lender Nationwide. They reported last week that annual house price growth in the UK turned negative in February for the first time in almost three years. Also coming up today The cost of living squeeze hit consumer spending last month, as shoppers cut back. Total retail sales rose by 5.2% in February compared with a year earlier, up slightly from January’s annual growth rate of 4.2%. But that masks a sharp fall in volumes, as high inflation means goods prices had risen by more. But there was strong sales of jewellery and fragrances for Valentine’s Day, according to the British Retail Consortium. The leader of Britain’s manufacturing bosses is expected to criticise the UK government “mismanagement” of the economy, and the post-Brexit relationship with the European Union, at the annual conference of Make UK today. Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of Make UK, will criticise the government’s failure to embrace a coherent industrial strategy, The Times reports. Phipson is expected to call for an end to “the rancour and political chaos of the last few years”, and express hopes that the new Windsor framework will lead to a new era of pragmatism and collaboration with the EU “rather than thumping the table or issuing threats”. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves will also address the conference, and announce a review on the UK’s business tax regime. Reeves is expected to say that a lack of business investment, fuelled by uncertainty and political instability under the Conservatives, has weighed on economic growth. European stock markets are expected to open a little higher, as investors wait to hear from America’s top central banker, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, who is set to appear before Congress. Powell will be quizzed about the Fed’s interest rate rises over the last year, and the apparent strength of the US economy. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: The fact that the US jobs market, or economic activity don’t react to higher Fed rates is a problem for Fed, because it makes the Fed’s arms less efficient for fighting against inflation. Many would argue that changes in rates take time to filter into the economy but the Fed’s tightening campaign began in November 2021 - 17 months ago, the rate hikes began roughly a year ago. It’s about time we start seeing the impact of higher rates through data.

                    "headline": "National Grid puts backup coal plants into action for first time this winter",
                    "bodyText": "National Grid has called coal plants put on standby as emergency backup into action for the first time this winter, before the coldest night of the year. Two units at EDF’s West Burton A plant in Nottinghamshire began producing power for the grid on Tuesday afternoon. Their output will be ramped up depending on how much electricity can be generated from other sources. The Met Office has issued weather warnings for rain and snow across the UK, with temperatures of -4C expected in London and -6C in Birmingham. A combination of freezing temperatures pushing up demand for power and heating, and low wind cutting windfarm electricity generation have made generation conditions tight. Strikes at EDF’s nuclear power plants in France, which supply Britain with electricity via subsea cables, have also raised concerns in recent days. The Nottinghamshire units are two of five covered by winter contingency contracts negotiated last year by the government to keep coal-fired power plants on standby for emergency use amid heightened concerns over power supplies this winter. The coal-fired plants, which also include units at Drax in Yorkshire and at Uniper’s Ratcliffe-on-Soar plant in Nottinghamshire, have been warmed for potential use several times this winter but stood down each time. The Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) has also asked two units at Drax in Yorkshire to warm up for potential use. Separately, ESO issued an electricity margin notice, telling the owners of all power plants to bring on extra power supplies between 4.30pm and 8.30pm on Tuesday. It later cancelled this requirement. National Grid stressed its measures to bolster supplies did not mean supplies were at risk. However, the ESO stopped short of paying consumers and businesses to turn down their energy use. Earlier on Tuesday, it issued a notice that it may employ its demand flexibility service on Wednesday but later said it would not run. The Grid has been on alert over risks of potential power cuts this winter because of concerns Russia would cut gas supplies into Europe, with a knock-on effect in Britain. However, a relatively mild winter and high levels of gas storage in Europe have eased these fears, and caused gas prices to fall sharply. A spokesperson for the ESO said that the coal units would offer “additional contingency to operate the network as normal”. In December, National Grid paid record amounts to encourage gas-fired power plants to crank up supply at short notice. Experts expected it to pay high prices to gas-fired plants again on Tuesday.

                    "bodyText": "Brazilian director Carolina Markowicz won awards left, right and centre for her touching 2018 short film The Orphan (O Órfão), about a queer teenage boy suddenly placed in an unfamiliar family. Her feature debut, Charcoal, once again centres around an outsider forcibly placed in the heart of family, but this time the algebra of sympathy is much more complex – and the threat of violence adds an unquantifiable extra variable. In rural Brazil, Irene (Maeve Jinkings) holds her struggling nuclear family together as best she can. Her husband Jairo (Rômulo Braga) earns money seasonally burning charcoal, but when he’s out of work he spends what little he has on booze. The couple’s nine-year-old son Jean (Jean de Almeida Costa, a real find) is a sweet kid who shares a bedroom with his bedridden grandfather Firmino (Benedito Alves), who has had a stroke and can no longer walk, talk or breathe without additional oxygen. One day, instead of the usual district nurse who comes to change Firmino’s oxygen tank, a healthcare worker named Juracy (Aline Marta Maia) shows up. Immediately sizing up the family and the weight of the burden Irene in particular is carrying, Juracy makes a modest proposal: why not “replace” poor old Firmino with someone who can help the family out financially? In other words, she proposes euthanising the old man and then taking in a special sort of lodger: an Argentinian crime “jefe” named Miguel (César Bordón) who has faked his own death and needs to lie low for a while. Juracy, it seems, is seriously connected and no ordinary healthcare worker. Nor is Miguel your average criminal overlord. By turns charming and peevish, he exerts a strange fascination over all three remaining members of the family in different ways, like Terence Stamp in Pasolini’s Teorema, or the titular visitor in Joe Orton’s play Entertaining Mr Sloane. Even little Jean is keen to please him and, in one hilarious-horrifying scene with his school principal, we find out that Jean has been caught trying to buy cocaine. If it had been marijuana, that would have been another matter; but cocaine is definitely a no-no for nine-year-olds. Eliciting uniformly confident, credible performances from professional and non-professional actors alike, Markowicz maintains a tight grip on the tone, keeping it just on the biting point between black comedy and agonising suspense. She builds a layered portrait of the larger community around the family, too, from inquisitive, prying neighbours to complacent priests who don’t really want to know what’s troubling members of their flock. Amid such a strong ensemble, Jinkings is the standout performer, incarnating a woman full of half-crushed dreams that could spark up with the slightest brush of hope. • Charcoal is in UK cinemas from 10 March and on digital platforms from 20 March."

                    "headline": "Is hydrogen really a clean enough fuel to tackle the climate crisis?",
                    "bodyText": "Hydrogen is the smallest, lightest and most abundant molecule in the universe. On Earth, it does not occur by itself naturally, but can be separated from water (H2O) or hydrocarbon compounds (fossil fuels) like gas, coal and petroleum to be used as an energy source. It’s already used for rocket fuel, but it is now being pushed as a clean and safe alternative to oil and gas for heating and earthly modes of transport. Political support is mounting with almost $26bn of US taxpayer money available for hydrogen projects thanks to three recent laws – the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Chips Act. Hydrogen is politically hot, but is it the climate solution that its cheerleaders are claiming? Why all the hype about hydrogen? The short answer is that the fossil fuel industry sees hydrogen as a way to keep on drilling and building new infrastructure. Friends of the Earth has tracked how the industry has successfully deployed its PR and lobbying machines over recent years to get policymakers thinking that hydrogen is a catch-all climate solution. Research by climate scientists (without fossil fuel links) has debunked industry claims that hydrogen should be a major player in our decarbonised future, though hydrogen extracted from water (using renewable energy sources) could – and should – play an important role in replacing the dirtiest hydrogen currently extracted from fossil fuels. It may also have a role in fuelling some transportation like long-haul flights and vintage cars, but the evidence is far from clear. However, with billions of climate action dollars up for grabs in the US alone, expect to see more lobbying, more industry-funded evidence and more hype. What’s the difference between blue, grey, brown, pink and green hydrogen? Extracting hydrogen is energy intensive, so the source and how it’s done both matter. Currently, about 96% of the world’s hydrogen comes from coal (brown) and gas (grey), with the rest created from nuclear (pink) and renewable sources like hydro, wind and solar. Production of both grey and brown hydrogen release carbon dioxide (CO2) and unburnt fugitive methane into the atmosphere. This super-polluting hydrogen is what’s currently used as the chemical base for synthetic nitrogen fertilisers, plastics and steel among other industries. Blue hydrogen is what the fossil fuel industry is most invested in, as it still comes from gas but ostensibly the CO2 would be captured and stored underground. The industry claims to have the technology to capture 80-90% of CO2, but in reality, it’s closer to 12% when every stage of the energy-intensive process is evaluated, according to a peer-reviewed study by scientists at Cornell University published in 2021. For sure better than nothing, but methane emissions, which warm the planet faster than CO2, would actually be higher than for grey hydrogen because of the additional gas needed to power the carbon capture, and likely upstream leakage. Notably, the term clean hydrogen was coined by the fossil fuel industry a few months after the seminal Cornell study found that blue hydrogen has a substantially larger greenhouse gas footprint than burning gas, coal or diesel oil for heating. Green hydrogen is extracted from water by electrolysis – using electricity generated by renewable energy sources (wind, solar, hydro). Climate experts (without links to fossil fuels) say green hydrogen can only be green if new renewable sources are constructed to power hydrogen production – rather than drawing on the current grid and questionable carbon accounting schemes. The industry disagrees: “Strict additionality rules requiring electrolytic hydrogen to be powered by new renewable energy is not practical, especially in the early years, and will severely limit the development of hydrogen projects,” said BP America. “There may be some small role in truly green hydrogen in a decarbonised future, but this is largely a marketing creation by the oil and gas industry that has been hugely overhyped,” said Robert Howarth, professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, a co-author of the paper on blue hydrogen. What’s at stake? In addition to $26bn in direct financing for so-called hydrogen hubs and demo projects, another $100bn or so in uncapped tax credits could be paid out over the next few decades, so lots and lots of taxpayers’ money. Fossil fuel companies are also using hydrogen to justify building more pipelines, claiming that this infrastructure can be used for “clean hydrogen” in the future. But hydrogen is a highly flammable and corrosive element, and it would be costly to repurpose oil and gas infrastructure to make it safe for hydrogen. And while hydrogen is not a greenhouse gas, it is not harmless. It aggravates some greenhouse gases, for instance causing methane to stay in the atmosphere for longer. “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in actual zero-emission solutions, but could be a disaster if the federal government pours scarce resources into infrastructure and technologies that could make the climate crisis worse and cause further public health harms,” said Sara Gersen, clean energy attorney at Earthjustice. “Sowing confusion about hydrogen is a delay tactic, and delay is the new denialism.” Is there any role for hydrogen in a decarbonised future? Yes, but a limited one – given that it takes more energy to produce, store and transport hydrogen than it provides when converted into useful energy, so using anything but new renewable sources (true green hydrogen) will require burning more fossil fuels. According to the hydrogen merit ladder devised by Michael Liebreich, host of the Cleaning Up podcast, swapping clean hydrogen for the fossil fuel-based grey and brown stuff currently used for synthetic fertilisers, petrochemicals and steel is a no-brainer. The carbon footprint of global hydrogen production today is equivalent to Germany’s annual greenhouse gas emissions, so the sooner we swap to green hydrogen (created from new renewables) the better. This could also be useful for some transportation, such as long-haul flights and heavy machinery, and maybe to store surplus wind and solar energy – though none are slam dunks for hydrogen as there are alternative technologies vying for these markets, said Liebreich. But for most forms of transport (cars, bikes, buses and trains) and heating there are already safer, cleaner and cheaper technologies such as battery-run electric vehicles and heat pumps, so there’s little or no merit in investing time or money with hydrogen. Howarth said: “Renewable electricity is a scarce resource. Direct electrification and batteries offer so much more, and much more quickly. It’s a huge distraction and waste of resources to even be talking about heating homes and passenger vehicles with hydrogen.”"

                    "bodyText": "A publicly owned electricity generation firm could save Britons nearly £21bn a year, according to new analysis that bolsters Labour’s case to launch a national energy company if the party gains power. Thinktank Common Wealth has calculated that the cost of generating electricity to power homes and businesses could be reduced by £20.8bn or £252 per household a year under state ownership, according to a report seen by the Guardian. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has committed to creating “a publicly owned national champion in clean energy” named Great British Energy. Starmer is yet to lay out the exact structure of the mooted company, although he has said it would not involve nationalising existing assets, or become involved in the transmission or retail supply of energy. Starmer instead hopes to create a state-backed entity that would invest in clean energy – wind, solar, tidal, nuclear and other emerging technologies – creating jobs and ensuring windfalls from the growth in low carbon power feed back to the government. The Common Wealth report, which analysed scenarios for reforming the electricity market, said that a huge saving on electricity costs could be made by buying out assets such as wind, solar and biomass generators on older contracts and running them on a non-profit basis. Funding the measure could require a government bond issuance, or some form of compulsory purchase process. Last year the government attempted to get companies operating low carbon generators, including nuclear power plants, on older contracts to switch to contracts for difference (CfD), allowing any outsized profits to flow back to taxpayers. However, the government later decided to tax eligible firms through the electricity generator levy instead. The Common Wealth study concluded that a publicly owned low carbon energy generator would best deliver on Britain’s climate and economic goals, would eliminate windfall profits made by generators and would cut household bills. MPs and campaigners have argued that Britain’s energy companies should be nationalised since the energy crisis, which has resulted in North Sea oil and gas producers and electricity generators making windfall profits, and a string of retail suppliers collapsing, costing taxpayers billions. Detractors of nationalisation in energy argue it can stifle innovation and expose taxpayers to huge financial risks. Common Wealth pointed out that more than 40% of the UK’s offshore wind generation capacity was publicly owned by overseas national entities, meaning the benefits of high electricity prices linked to the war in Ukraine had flowed back to other governments. The study found the publicly owned generator model would create more savings than other options, including a drive for voluntary CfDs; splitting the generation market between low carbon and fossil fuel sources and a “single buyer model” with nationalised retail suppliers. The Common Wealth director, Mathew Lawrence, said: “The energy system faces two acute challenges: the staggering profits being made by generators, and the need to rapidly decarbonise generation. “A publicly owned generator can address both these pressing issues, rebuilding out energy system around the public interest. That is the fastest, fairest, most effective way to build a clean, secure, affordable power system.” Starmer has cited the success of European energy firms with state backing including Sweden’s Vattenfall and Ørsted, which is part owned by the Danish state. The authors of the Common Wealth report argued that Great British Energy could be a “powerful tool” in decarbonising Britain, but said ambition akin to the creation of the NHS was needed to make a serious difference. “An approach to reform that does not go to the root of the upstream problems in our energy system, that does not build out at scale and instead remains a marginal actor in the transition, will be unable to deliver on its potential or, in the case of Great British Energy, its stated goals. In this context, timidity and incrementalism are the greatest risks, and ambition the safest path forward,” they wrote."

                    "bodyText": "The former Australian prime minister Paul Keating has accused two of the country’s biggest newspapers of “the most egregious and provocative news presentation” in five decades, after they published front-page stories warning the country faced war with China within three years. The former Labor leader, who has long argued Australia should not be drawn into a war over the status of democratically governed Taiwan, took aim at the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age on Tuesday. The papers published a special report based on assessments of five national security experts who, in a joint statement labelled “Red Alert”, said they believed Australia “faces the prospect of armed conflict in the Indo-Pacific within three years” but was not prepared for such a war. Keating said on Tuesday: “Today’s Sydney Morning Herald and Age front-page stories on Australia’s supposed war risk with China represents the most egregious and provocative news presentation of any newspaper I have witnessed in over 50 years of active public life. “It is way worse than the illustrated sampans shown to be coming from China in the buildup to the war in Vietnam in the 1960s.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The story was splashed on the front of the Sydney Morning Herald print edition under the headline “Red alert: War risk exposed”, while the Age used the title “Australia ‘must prepare’ for threat of China war”. Both papers included a graphic showing 13 black aircraft flying from China, which was marked in red with the Chinese flag. Keating added: “Apart from the outrageous illustrations of jet aircraft being shown leaving a profiled red-coloured map of China, the extent of the bias and news abuse is, I believe, unparalleled in modern Australian journalism.” Nine – publisher of the two newspapers – issued a strong defence of its journalists on Tuesday afternoon. “Mr Keating has indulged in personal slurs against the journalists at the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age instead of engaging in the substance of their reporting,” the executive editor, Tory Maguire, said in a statement. “It’s not a useful contribution from someone well placed to have a meaningful impact on the conversation about our readiness to protect and defend Australia. “Peter Hartcher and Matthew Knott are two of the country’s most highly respected journalists and we stand by their reporting and the expertise of the contributors to the challenging and thought-provoking Red Alert series. “We note he had nothing to say when the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Sky News Australia also recently examined the threat of conflict with China and our nation’s preparedness.” The coverage to which Keating objected featured a panel of five national security experts, who warned of the risk of “a Chinese attack on Taiwan that sparks a conflict with the US and other democracies, including Australia”. The panel said it based its assertions on Chinese president Xi Jinping’s aggressive stance and rapid military buildup. It also said Australia was not prepared for conflict and the federal government was “reluctant to openly identify the threat we face: an increasingly aggressive Communist China”. Xi told the 20th Communist party congress last year he would never rule out the use of force to achieve “reunification” with Taiwan, a self-governed democracy of 24 million people that he regards as central to his promise to achieve “national rejuvenation”. Keating, who was prime minister from 1991 to 1996, is a vocal critic of the bipartisan consensus that has formed in Canberra about Australia’s security outlook and policies such as Aukus. His latest criticism comes as Australia prepares this month to announce how it plans to acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines with help from the US and the UK. At the National Press Club in November 2021, Keating ridiculed the Aukus submarine plan as “like throwing a handful of toothpicks at the mountain”. He also urged Australia not to be drawn into a military engagement over Taiwan, “US-sponsored or otherwise”, and said Taiwan was “fundamentally a civil matter” for China. He also referred to Taiwan as China’s “front doorstep”. Taiwan’s ministry of foreign affairs responded to Keating’s intervention in 2021 by saying a crisis in the Taiwan Strait was “by no means a domestic matter between Chinese, and the security of the Taiwan Strait involves the stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region, but also the global peace, stability and development”. In addition to the looming Aukus announcement, the Albanese government is working on its response to a sweeping defence strategic review overseen by the former defence chief Angus Houston and the former Labor defence minister Stephen Smith. A declassified version of the review and the government’s response to it are both due to be released in April, in the leadup to a May budget that is expected to see an overall growth in defence funding. The defence minister and deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, has repeatedly said Australia “is facing the most challenging and complex set of strategic circumstances we’ve seen since the second world war”. Last week Marles said China was “driving the largest conventional military buildup we’ve seen anywhere in the world since the second world war – and much of this buildup is opaque”."

                    "bodyText": "The head of the UN nuclear weapons inspectorate was forced to qualify some of the claims he made about commitments he had extracted from Iran at the weekend about increasing access to UN inspectors. At his first press conference on his return from Tehran on Saturday, Rafael Grossi said “yes” when asked if Iran had pledged to restore all the cameras and other surveillance equipment that it had removed from its nuclear-related sites. But at Monday’s press conference he qualified this, saying it required further discussion. He said there was no agreement at this point on Iran handing over older footage and data taken by cameras and other equipment at the nuclear-related sites, or on future provision of that footage and data. “There are certain things we need to clarify,” he said. Grossi’s visit to Tehran came ahead of a meeting of the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency this week to discuss a possible further censure of Iran for failure to cooperate with inspectors. If the IAEA board passes a highly critical resolution, Iran might again respond by increasing levels of uranium enrichment and stockpiles that are already far in excess of the limits set in the nuclear deal of 2015. It could also destroy some of the camera footage it has been storing at nuclear sites but not handing to the UN inspectors, a move that would further damage the IAEA’s continuity of knowledge about the nuclear programme. Grossi, a highly experienced Argentinian diplomat, has extracted Iranian promises before to restore the inspectors’ previous level of access that European powers and the US feel were not delivered, so in a context of minimal trust the west will want to examine how precise and bankable are the latest set of voluntary commitments that Iran offered Grossi in Tehran. A concern is that Tehran is making vague promises to carry it over the hurdle of the IAEA board meeting. On the other hand, the US, preoccupied with Ukraine, appears not to be in a mood to censure Iran over its nuclear programme or to try to restore the stalled nuclear deal. At his press conference, Grossi dismissed public statements by Iranian officials that they would not give him access to key Iranian nuclear scientists, implying that behind the scenes they are sending him different messages."

                    "bodyText": "Nearly 60 years after a midair collision dumped four US hydrogen bombs in south-eastern Spain, strewing radioactive plutonium across the landscape, Spanish officials have renewed efforts to have Washington cart off tens of thousands of cubic metres of contaminated soil to the US for storage. A source at Spain’s ministry of foreign affairs confirmed on Monday that it had formally requested the US takes action to remove the radioactive earth. The request is in line with a non-binding agreement struck between the two countries in 2015 and which included a US commitment to “arrange for disposal of the contaminated earth at an appropriate site in the United States”. As the US had yet to formally respond, the source declined to offer further details. El País, the Spanish newspaper that first reported the story, said the request had been lodged a few months ago. The US government did not respond to a request for comment. The demand is the latest chapter in a saga that traces back to January 1966 when a US B-52 bomber loaded with nuclear weapons collided with a tanker plane during a midair refuelling operation off the coast of Almeria, Spain. Seven of the two planes’ 11 crew members were killed. Four hydrogen bombs tumbled from the B-52; one was later recovered intact in the Mediterranean while the other three crashed on land near the coastal village of Palomares. While the bombs did not explode, two of the plutonium-filled detonators went off, scattering 7lb of radioactive plutonium-239 across the landscape. The US sent about 1,600 servicemen to the crash site to recover the weapons and clean up the contamination. About 1,400 tonnes of contaminated soil was shipped to a facility in South Carolina. Both countries were eager to downplay the collision, which took place during the height of the cold war and as Spain was in the grip of the Franco dictatorship. Amid fears that the risk of radioactive contamination would harm the country’s budding tourism industry, Spain’s then tourism minister and the US ambassador took a widely publicised swim in the sea off the coast of Palomares in the weeks after the incident. Concerns over the lingering impacts of the collision catapulted back into the spotlight in 2007, after a study suggested up to 50,000 sq metres of land remained contaminated. The affected area was fenced off and barred from being used for agriculture or development. In 2015 Madrid and Washington signed off on an agreement to negotiate a binding deal for the site’s remediation. “We have to build on today’s signing to take further action to resolve – once and for all – this very important issue,” the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, said during a joint press conference with the Spanish foreign minister at the time, José Manuel García-Margallo. Little was done to implement the agreement, however, as elections ushered in changes in Spain and the US. The Spanish government’s recent decision to take up the issue again with the US was prompted by the assessment that bilateral relations were “at their best in years,” sources told El País, leaving Madrid hopeful that some progress could be made before Spain heads to the polls for general elections at the end of the year."

                    "headline": "Britain’s armed forces expected to receive multibillion boost to modernise",
                    "bodyText": "Britain’s armed forces are expected to receive a multibillion-pound two-year spending boost to urgently modernise an army described as “15 years behind its peer group” by the defence secretary, Ben Wallace. Wallace told a conference he hoped to secure a longer-term commitment to ensure that “defence will have a greater share” of government spending, although it is unclear what status any promise that would apply after an election would have. The immediate billions are due to be unveiled ahead of next Wednesday’s budget by the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, at a trilateral summit in San Diego with Joe Biden, the US president, and Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister. The three leaders will unveil the next steps of the Aukus defence pact, including the preferred design of the nuclear -powered submarines that will be made for Canberra using secret British and American nuclear propulsion technologies. But at the summit Sunak, considered to be sceptical about the need for extra defence funding when he was chancellor, will also prop up the UK defence budget in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, although the final settlement is not yet confirmed. On Monday the Times reported defence would receive £5bn, less than the £8bn to £11bn Wallace had sought. Defence sources declined to comment on the reports, and Wallace has previously said some of the numbers circulating in the public domain are “not actually very accurate”. The cabinet minister told the defence conference, organised by the Conservative Home website, that “this budget is effectively a budget within a spending period” that ends in March 2025, and “the real battle for defence” will come at a spending review to be held after the next election. Previously, Boris Johnson committed to lifting defence spending from the current 2.1% GDP to 2.5% by 2030, in one of his last acts as prime minister at a Nato summit last June. His short-lived successor Liz Truss pledged to lift that to 3%, before Sunak became prime minister, setting both promises aside. Wallace said he hoped to reopen that debate, asking rhetorically: “Can I also send a strong signal, can the government, that the public and the Treasury and other government departments will just have to get used to the fact that, come 2025-26, for the next spending review envelope, defence will just have a greater share than it’s traditionally done.” The minister said his primary goal was to speed up modernisation of the British army, which he said was like a fine wine “that had gone over about 15 years ago”. Gaps in capability that had been left open as part of the government’s integrated review in 2021 were now exposed by Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Wallace said “the negotiations I am now involved with” were about closing up some of those gaps – including increasing the target size of the army, reduced to 73,500 as part of the previous review. “I’m open-minded to some extent about the size of the armed forces,” he said. Next week Sunak is expected to unveil a refresh to the integrated review, taking into account the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has emphasised the importance of land warfare, when the previous strategy sought to push a navy-led “global Britain” free trade concept. Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the Commons defence committee, said at the conference that Britain needed to respond because its military was “getting down to rock bottom” and it was time to “make a case” to the electorate for higher military spending. “We are entering a new cold war,” the Conservative MP said. Other countries are lifting their defence budgets, most notably Poland, which is in the process of increasing its spending to 4% of GDP."

                    "bodyText": "And that’s where we’ll leave you this evening. Here’s a wrap of the main events today: Malcom Turnbull said he raised initial concerns about robodebt with minister Alan Tudge in early 2017, the then prime minister told the royal commission into the failed scheme. The independent MP Sophie Scamps introduced her “ending jobs for mates” bill, which seeks to ensure government appointments are done independently. The Nationals senator Jacinta Price said the Coalition will vote against changes to the Referendum Machinery Act unless the government sets up and funds official yes and no campaign bodies. Adam Bandt and the Greens said “everyone needs to give a bit” to get climate legislation on the safeguard mechanism through the Senate. The Albanese government made a legislative instrument authorising $9.5m of spending for a voice civics and awareness campaign. Heatwave conditions gripped NSW, as temperatures exceeded 38C across Sydney and 32 schools across the state were closed due to bushfire risk. The independent senator David Pocock said that there was “surely a better way” to reduce inflation than by raising interest rates. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi said that “anything less” than paid parental leave for PhD students would be “a pretty cruel oversight”. The New South Wales corruption watchdog discontinued its investigation into the appointment of the former deputy premier, John Bariarlo, to a plum trade role last year. And you can watch Monique Ryan’s clap back to the opposition during question time earlier today in the video below: Returning to politicians appearing in the media, Liberal senator Linda Reynolds was on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, and also doubled down on the Coalition’s opposition to the government’s superannuation proposal. Reynolds said it was “yet another broken promise” made by the government, and that they were justifying it with “weasel words”: Both prime minister and the treasurer during the campaign, both promised that we were not going to have any big changes to the superannuation system and, guess what, yet another broken promise. All of these weasel words that the government are now trying to use, and again in the Senate this afternoon with the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, ducking and weaving, but she had to admit as a result of questions from Senator Canavan, that, in fact, it is not 0.5%, it is 10%, and there is secret modelling. So now what we’re saying is let’s release the modelling that they have been hiding from the Australian people and see what that modelling actually says. ABC editorial staff have announced they will be postponing a 40-minute strike, initially scheduled for tomorrow to coincide with the Reserve Bank’s next interest rate decision, to consider a new offer from management. The proposed strike has been halted to give union officials time to work through the new offer, which includes an 11% pay increase over three years and a $1,500 sign-on bonus. In a statement from the MEAA, the media union’s media director, Cassie Derrick, said the threat of a strike had brought management back to the bargaining table: The new offer provided by management this morning contains several improvements on what has been on the table until now. Members are encouraged that the new offer hears their concerns on gender and race pay gaps and buyouts and comes some way to addressing claims on progression and a fair pay rise. It does not satisfy all of employees’ demands and there is still work to be done, but there is no doubt the pressure from union members has led to this better offer from ABC’s managing director David Anderson after his executives refused to negotiate for weeks. The Nationals senator Jacinta Price says the Coalition will vote against changes to the Referendum Machinery Act unless the government sets up and funds official yes and no campaign bodies, claiming those demands were “the line” for opposition support. Earlier we reported that the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, said the opposition would stand against the amendments until more of its demands were met. The Indigenous Australians minister, Linda Burney, has asked the Coalition to “meet us halfway” and support the changes to the Referendum Machinery Act, saying the government had already made a “significant concession” by reinstating the official information pamphlet, setting out the official cases of the yes and no side, after Coalition requests. Price, appearing on the ABC on Monday, said those two requests were “the line” for the Coalition’s support. Asked about official funding for the yes and no campaigns, something the government has flatly ruled out, Price said: “Yes, that is certainly the line.” “As well as establishing an official yes and no. It is important in terms of funding for any referendum going forward that we can ensure that there isn’t foreign interference, that the AEC are involved when it comes to appropriately listing donors to both sides as well,” she said. Price, a leading campaigner of the no side, said the Machinery changes would go further than just the voice to parliament referendum. “Making changes to this piece of legislation also affects future referendums, so the Coalition is right in terms of considering issues [like public funding],” she said. Icac drops John Barilo investigation The New South Wales corruption watchdog has discontinued its investigation into the appointment of former deputy premier, John Bariarlo, to a plum trade role last year. The Independent Commission Against Corruption has been investigating the appointment since July and, after conducting interviews and collecting information, did not identify any evidence of corrupt conduct. A spokesperson for Icac said: In July 2022, the commission decided to investigate whether, in relation to the recruitment of the Senior Trade and Investment Commissioner to the Americas, John Barilaro, Stuart Ayres, Amy Brown or any other public official breached public trust, or exercised their official functions dishonestly or partially, or adversely affected the honest or impartial exercise of official functions by any public official. During the course of the investigation, the commission obtained information and documents from various sources by issuing notices under sections 21 and 22 of the Icac Act and summonses under section 35 of the Icac Act. The commission also conducted interviews and obtained oral evidence from witnesses in a number of compulsory examinations. The investigation did not identify any evidence of corrupt conduct. As a result, the commission has discontinued its investigation. The commission does not plan to take further action. Previous reporting: Guardian ranked sixth in digital news in February The Guardian has come in sixth among digital news platforms last month, with its reach beating out the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Daily Telegraph. Coming in behind leader news.com.au and a range of news sites, such as ABC News and Daily Mail Australia, the Guardian reached 34% of online Australians over the age of 14. It comes after Ipsos IRIS became the officially endorsed industry measurement for digital ratings by the IAB. The new measurement services has extended reporting capabilities, including expanded demographic reporting, new metrics, duplication functionality and reporting at the subsection level. Anne Ruston doubles down on opposition to super proposal Returning to politics, the Liberal senator Anne Ruston was just on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, where she was doubling down on the Coalition’s opposition to the government’s superannuation proposal. Ruston argued that the key issue wasn’t the actual financial machinery of the proposal, but that it was a broken election promise: I think the real issue here is the fact that you can’t go to the election and make a promise and then a few minutes later change that. So all this says to the Australian public is what this government said in order to get themselves elected, they don’t actually care about, they are quite happy to go back on it. Then in Question Time we ask questions of the finance minister about what happens if one member of a couple dies, what is the impact on the other person? We don’t know what will happen to primary producers who often have the farm in the superannuation accounts. It is just that huge uncertainty and the broken promises that I think will eventually start coming out and realising that this policy has been ill-conceived and there is not enough detail. NSW heatwave I wanted to just step away from politics for a moment to discuss the heatwave conditions that are currently affecting New South Wales. In an update this afternoon, the Bureau of Meteorology says fire dangers reached extreme levels today, and are set to remain high tomorrow, with Fire Weather Warnings current for the Greater Hunter, Central Ranges and Lower Central West Plains districts. Maximum temperatures are forecast to spike 6 to 12°C above average across eastern parts of NSW. These conditions are being driven by hot and dry continental west-north-westerly winds, bringing the high temperatures to eastern NSW including Sydney. They also say dry thunderstorms may impact north-east NSW on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Bureau saud it wasn’t unusual to experience heatwave conditions in March, as the weather transitions towards autumn and winter. The Bureau’s long-range forecast for Autumn indicates it is likely to be drier and warmer than usual for much of Australia. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you to cover the rest of the day’s news. The wonderful Mostafa Rachwani will take you through the rest of the afternoon, and what else is happening today, outside of politics. I will be back with the Canberra team very early tomorrow morning, where it is party room meeting time, and more parliamentary shannigans. Thank you so much to everyone who joined me today – I very much appreciate it. Have a wonderful afternoon, and take care of you. Peter Dutton’s Aukus information ‘out of date, and he knows it’ In question time today, two government ministers took aim at the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, for comments he made about Aukus with only a short time to go before the official announcement is made. The defence minister and deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, argued Dutton’s comments had muddied the waters on bipartisanship around Aukus. Marles told parliament Dutton’s remarks had “raised eyebrows abroad about whether or not the Coalition is on board”. Marles said the last time the former defence minister had received a confidential briefing about Aukus “was in the very early days of a process which has gone a long way since then”: The leader of the opposition’s information is very out of date, and he knows it. The minister for defence industry, Pat Conroy, reaffirmed the government’s pledge to build submarines in Adelaide. Conroy claimed that Dutton’s comments meant he had “surrendered on Aussie jobs and advocated building our nuclear submarines overseas; he cut Adelaide loose”. It’s worth pointing out that Dutton has repeatedly pledged to support the government’s announcement on the optimal pathway for Australia to acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines (even after he made a few public interventions last week expressing his preference for the US Virginia class submarines over a British option still in development). Jacqui Lambie Network ‘just want Tasmania’s fair share’ on housing funding The Jacqui Lambie Network senator Tammy Tyrell is next up on the ABC speaking about the negotiations the JLN is having with the government over things like its national reconstruction fund and the housing future fund. If the Coalition opposes a bill, then the government needs the Greens and at least two crossbench senators (it used to be one, but Lidia Thorpe becoming an independent now makes it two) which puts Lambie and Tyrell in a key negotiating spot. Tyrell says they will be using it to get what they can for Tasmania: We are asking for the 1,200 homes because there is a government report that comes out annually and within that 4% of the people most in need of a home and support are in Tasmania. And 4% of the housing fund is 1,200 homes over five years. Tyrell says they just want Tasmania’s fair share, which is 4% so they aren’t shooting for the stars. ‘If you don’t approve new coal and gas, we can start to tackle the climate crisis,’ Greens say to government The Greens senator Larissa Waters is on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing where she is giving an update on the negotiations with the government around its safeguards bill: We are still in active discussions with the government and you are right to say we’re suggesting strongly to them and offering to them, we will cop your very average scheme that allows unlimited offsets and has limited targets if you just stop making the climate problem worse by approving 113 new coal and gas projects that are in the pipeline. Or a subset thereof. We don’t understand why Labor wants new coal and gas so badly that this is somehow a sticking point for them. We are still making that offer, you have got a scheme that is pretty weak and will deliver some pretty weak targets but at least if you don’t approve new coal and gas, we can start to tackle the climate crisis. Again, we are having those discussions, we have made that offer and we really would like the government to take that offer very seriously. TikTok says it ‘collects less data than many popular mobile apps’ Earlier today the Liberal senator James Paterson called for more Australian government departments to ban TikTok on government devices. Asked for a response to these comments, a spokesperson for TikTok said: Just like many private sector organisations, commonwealth government agencies have policies that may restrict the use of social media and messaging apps on devices. In the case of these departments, we understand the restrictions apply to a range of apps and software, not just TikTok. As a global company, we are not unique in how we operate. Some of the best-known and trusted Australian companies, including banks and telcos, openly state in their privacy policies that they share Australian user information with employees and third parties around the world, including China. These organisations often collect sensitive data like financial information, medical records, legal information and more. The TikTok app collects less data than many popular mobile apps. Our community’s safety and privacy is our top priority, and we continue to be diligent in ensuring we meet, or exceed, the data security standards applied to companies that operate in Australia. Bill Shorten also used QT to give his latest robodebt statement Asked: What has the Royal Commission into robodebt uncovered about what was said in public by former ministers in charge of the unlawful scheme, versus what they actually believed, and how many robodebts were raised between 29 May 2019 and 19 November 2019? Shorten replied: In the most recent block of hearings at the royal commission into robodebt, we’ve heard from professor Renee Leon, former Secretary of Department of Human Services, Timothy French, DHS legal counsel and the member, then the minister for human services. Specifically, Mr French testified that in a meeting in early July 2019 the member for Fadden was verbally briefed with the Australian government solicitor opinion that robodebt was on very shaky grounds. Testimony which professor Leon corroborated in her own in her own evidence. Further evidence was led that on July the 31st, the member for Fadden appeared on the ABC’s Insider program defending robodebt and stating, amongst other things, that in 99.2% of the cases, the debt was correct. 99.2%, he said. However, last week, under questioning by the royal commissioner, the member for Fadden admitted that he knew that what he was saying was false. The royal commissioner said, and I quote commissioner “your evidence was that you could not raise a debt based solely on averaging”. Member for Fadden, “Yes, that was my belief, Yes, Commissioner”. “And the 90% of those cases, that is exactly what was happening under the program, to your knowledge, minister?” “That’s correct, commissioner”. “So what you said there, to your knowledge at the time was false?” Minister, and this is very, very, very interesting, “my personal view, yes, but I’m still a government minister, and it is still a government program, and that was the approach the government had signed off on”. The basic position of the evidence of the member for Fadden was that cabinet solidarity allowed him as a minister to give statistics that he did not believe on robodebt in Australia. (Paul Fletcher had a point of order about not drawing any conclusions, as the commission is ongoing) Shorten: I say this in all collegiality, but I thank the manager of opposition business for giving me the chance to go to the precise quote, minister for member for Fadden at page 4220, “they were the numbers from the department based on the work approach and how the program is being run. That was the accepted figures. And as a dutiful cabinet minister, ma’am, that’s all we do”. Then the commissioner replies, “misrepresent things to the Australian people?” The evidence was very idiosyncratic for the member, for the member for Fadden. The story that was being put in the royal commission last week is that there is a doctrine of collective ministerial responsibility that allowed the previous government to mislead the people. Adam Bandt and the Greens held a press conference before question time, including speaking about the safeguard mechanism. Bandt said: New coal and gas will blow even the government’s own climate targets. The government’s own modellers have confirmed on the government’s emissions projections from last year, there will be a 35m tonne blowout in the safeguard mechanism. This reinforces what the Greens have been saying all along: there is no space for new coal and gas if we are to meet our climate targets. We will continue to have discussions with the government about the safeguard mechanism, including this week, while we are in parliament. The one thing we haven’t yet heard a satisfactory answer to publicly from the government, is why they want to keep opening up new coal and gas mines.” Asked about negotiations, Bandt said the government doesn’t have a mandate for new coal and gas because they don’t have a majority in both houses of parliament and 57% of Australians don’t support new coal and gas. He said: So the government is going to need to shift a bit if they want to get legislation through the Senate. We’ve been prepared to shift. We’ve been prepared to compromise on targets, we’ve offered to compromise on offsets, we’ve even accepted the government using Tony Abbott’s reheated climate mechanism. For just one thing: the government stops opening new coal and gas mines. Now, everyone has to give a bit to get legislation through... We’ve also said if there are other suggestions of why you’re dealing with coal and gas, we will look at those in good faith as well. A climate trigger has been suggested by others. Some have said, let’s have a pause on new coal and gas projects while we reevaluate our environment laws. We are happy to look at all of those proposals and we will in good faith as part of a package to see some genuine climate action in this country. But the government has to shift and the government has to understand, you can’t tackle the climate process by opening new coal and gas mines.” Anthony Albanese finally, finally calls an end to question time – and just as Michael McCormack gets up to ask a question. It’s enough to send you hunting for kava. (McCormack changed his twitter header photo to one of him drinking kava, so at least he has a sense of humour) Question time is now at 1.45 hours I am on coffee number five. If I had known this is how today was going to turn out, I would have had the easter eggs for breakfast, so I would have had one small moment of joy today. We are sticking with super, after Katy Gallagher told the Senate in that chamber’s question time that Treasury advice is that in 30 years time, one in 10 Australians could be affected by the super concession changes (because of indexation capturing more Australians, but Treasury has also overestimated wage growth almost every single year for the past decade and a bit). It is also pretty bold to assume there would be no changes to tax or super in three decades, but anyways. Peter Dutton has a question: Was the prime minister aware of the treasurer advise that one in 10 Australians will be affected by the proposed super changes when he made public commentary on this matter last week? If so, prime minister, what is your advice to a 37-year-old’s investment decisions today into their superannuation who would be affected by these changes? Anthony Albanese: My advice to a 37-year-old would be listened to old Angus and not new Angus. In June 2016... (Albanese is asked to refer to members by their proper titles) The shadow treasurer… He is very angry, Mr Speaker. Save the yelling for the New South Wales Liberal campaign launch on Sunday. Save it for that. This is what the shadow treasurer had to say. ‘The situation we had was some people were contributing millions of dollars into super, and it is totally inappropriate that someone who has contributed millions and millions of dollars continues to get those 15 per cent concessions. That is what they had to say’. Well done, Angus. It was after the Treasurer budget speech that year were the then Treasurer, the member for Cook had this to say. ‘We will be reducing access to generous superannuation tax concessions for the most wealthy’. Today, they have come in here and I have let question time go for over an hour and a half. They have finally got to ask me a question about super. What they talk about is something that happens in 30 years. Even though when they made the changes under section 293, they did not index it. Income tax rates. They do not index it. In 30 years’ time, I make this prediction. I make this bold prediction in 30 years’ time. Some people will be earning more than they are today in dollar terms, and some people will be paying different income tax rates in 30 years than they are now. Different people will be contributing, under section 293, in terms of superannuation, the changes that they delivered in 2016 and 2017. The difference is this, Mr Speaker. Our tax changes affect one-half of one per cent. The difference is this. Our changes affect half of one per cent. Their changes affected four per cent. They were not indexed. They had an impact of $5bn. Our modest changes... Albanese runs out of time. We are now one and a half hours into this question time and that we are all still here, pretending these are very normal people having very normal reactions in a very normal situation really says something about what years of question time has done to our brains. Because this is the question time that never ends, we even get to Angus Taylor asking Jim Chalmers a question. My question is to the treasurer. Has the treasurer seen advice for Treasury that the so-called half a percent of people affected by their super changes rise to 10% of Australians? (There are cheers from Labor) Chalmers: It took until 3.24pm to break the pea-hearted silence of the shadow treasurer, 3:24 we had to sit here for an hour and a half to wait for a question from the shadow treasurer, he hasn’t asked me since November, Mr Speaker, and after all that waiting, that’s the best of the can come up with. What a joker, Mr Speaker, the answer to this question is this, and I know that it comes from the questioning in the Senate what they did have the courage to ask some questions about superannuation in the Senate today, not like the pea-hearted approach of those opposite here and the shadow treasurer, but the and that the shadow treasurer is referring to, is that right now, in 2025, less than half of 1% of people will be impacted, by the time... Let me finish, let me wait for in, let me finish, by the beginning of next decade, it’ll be around 1% and the answer of that, Senator Gallagher, the great Finance Minister and the other place gave, a moment ago on, is in 30 years, one in 10 people will be impacted by it, this is the number that the shadow treasurer thinks is some kind of stunning insight. The lengths that they will go to, Mr Speaker, the lengths that they will go to to hide what should be their shamefaced embarrassment that we can’t get a question, can’t get a question from the shadow treasurer about energy bills, can’t get about housing affordability, can get about manual manufacturing that this bloke will go to the wall for half a percent of people getting tax rates in the superannuation system. What we are proposing, Mr Speaker, is a modest change but it is a simple choice. And on the side of the house when we inherited $1 trillion of Liberal party debt and deficits as far as the eye can see an unfunded ongoing commitments and intensifying pressures in the budget, we say that the generous concessions in superannuation for half a percent of people can be a little bit less generous, we know what those opposite do when the budget and the pressure, the victimised and they demonise people, the most honourable people in this country with robodebt and they come after Medicare like the member for Dickson did last time that the Liberals were in office. Mr Speaker, as those opposite thrash around in the shallowest and mightiest bottles of political opportunism, on this side of the house, the adults will continue to make serious decisions about serious pressures on the budget that we inherited for those opposite. And will continue to make the right course for the right reasons to clean up the mess that they left us. The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser then has a question for Amanda Rishworth: Two weeks ago, the leader of the opposition and the member for O’Connor and I travelled [to the Goldfields in] WA, we heard from local leaders that since this government abolished the cashless debit card, it’s been an increase in alcohol-related violence and children in this community is not being fed. When will the prime minister start listening to the local voices of communities calling for the reinstatement of the cashless debit card? Rishworth: Of course, there’s a lot of emotion around the cashless debit card and some on the other side are using that for political purposes. They are using it in a way to divide communities and spread misinformation. Of course, alcohol misuse in remote and rural Australia due to a complex ranges of issues and the Goldfields is no different. I will remind the house, I will remind the house that the [Goldfield lands] were never subject to the cashless debit card. So, of course, making this connection is misleading. Of course, it’s also been publicly reported which I’m assuming the leader of the opposition listen to, that there is recent royalty payments which have attracted larger groups in to town to access these funds, that are remind everyone that royalty payments have never been restricted by the cashless debit card. So, once again, these connections do not actually add up and once again, as an example of the misinformation that I would also like to quote some comments from Aboriginal elder who said people with serious drinking problems among those from who receive substantial money royalties and travel to the Goldfields region to spend the payment alcohol, that’s what the leader of opposition heard and why he would come into this place and try and mislead and conflate is beyond me. But I will say that we, as a government, investing in the things at work, we will invest in the support and services that work, we are continued my department continues to consult with those regions because not only did we promise and commit money to the existing services that were to end under those opposite, the 1 July this year, no more money for these sites, of course, we have not only committed that funding but committed extra funding to the services that work. I will, and this government will continue to work with those communities affected by these complex issues to deliver real and lasting solution, we’re not to play politics and either of those of the other side well. The Liberal MP for Casey, Aaron Violi, who is in the running to take the ‘Vince Connolly question delivery tribute’ trophy (we miss you Vince) has the next non-government question: Kieran, who runs a cafe in Lilydale, is bracing for the cafe’s power bill to increase by $2,438 this year. The prime minister promised Australians like Kieran that he would cut their power bills by $275. Why has the prime minister misled the Australian people? Isn’t this yet another broken promise by this tricky prime minister? (He delivers it like he’s standing in the spotlight of a community theatre stage, addressing the fourth wall, and thinking of his high school drama teacher who always urged him to ‘really believe it Aaron!’) Anthony Albanese: I thank Kieran for his question - the member for Casey for his question about Kieran, a constituent in his electorate. And I hope that he can tell Kieran that the parliament sat last December and we passed a significant plan. We passed a plan for a cap on gas prices. The New South Wales Parliament and the Queensland administration also put in place price caps on coal. The RBA, the IMF, AEMO and AGL have all confirmed that our plan is working, has made a difference. The energy price relief plan is something that the member for Casey came in here and voted against. And as of 3 February, wholesale electricity forward prices were nearly half that in November. 3 February, wholesale electricity forward prices were nearly half of that in November. And that is in spite of the opposition of those opposite. And I hope he tells Kieran that he’s sorry that he voted against energy price relief because they vote against everything over there. Don’t have any constructive ideas. Apparently aren’t aware that, you know, there’s been this international spike because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Apparently, that hasn’t happened and hasn’t had an impact. Well, it has had an impact right around the world. And we’re dealing with practical measures, unlike those opposite, who - unlike their Liberal and National counterparts in New South Wales and indeed in Queensland - chose, chose to just say no. A secret squirrel blog watcher in the chamber tells us it was Peter Dutton who was heckling Kooyong independent MP Dr Monique Ryan about being prime minister as she rose to ask her earlier question. So it seems it was to Dutton that Ryan said “I’ll be there before you”. The Labor MP for Calwell, Maria Vamvakinou has a very broad dixer for Mark Dreyfus: How important is it for ministers to act in accordance with the law? That is so Dreyfus can bring up Stuart Robert’s royal commission appearance: When we set up the robodebt royal commission shortly after coming into government, the degree of dishonesty and shocking lack of probity and lack of integrity of the former Liberal government was already very well-known. But the painstaking work of this royal commission has uncovered an even greater degree of wrongdoing than many of us had anticipated. Last week, the member for Fadden revealed to the commission that while he was the minister responsible in 2019, he had serious doubts about the legality of the robodebt scheme. And despite those doubts - this is what he also revealed - the member for Fadden continued to publicly defend the scheme and use fake statistics that he knew to be false. When asked about this at the royal commission, the member for Fadden said, “cabinet made me do it.” I can reassure this house that there is nothing... Paul Fletcher has a point of order: Again, the principle is that a minister should not be putting a construction on the evidence or the drawing of conclusions. Now, I will give the member for Maribyrnong [Bill Shorten] credit that he was quoting from precise, verbatim pieces of evidence. You would have thought that the first law officer of the nation would also adopt that same principle. Milton Dick: Just remind all ministers not to give a concluded view whilst the royal commission is under way. And I’d ask the minister to refer directly to evidence in his answer and I give him the call. Dreyfus: Thank you, Mr Speaker. And I would refer to transcript pages at the commission, pages 4219 to 4220. The damage done by behaviour that we’ve seen revealed at this royal commission weakens the bond of trust between voters and elected representatives. Voters are entitled to the most basic expectation that those in power abide by the law... Fletcher: Mr Speaker, it is extraordinary this point needs to be made about the conduct of the first law officer of the land, but the royal commission is specifically tasked with finding facts and drawing conclusions, and for this reason you have rightly ruled, as have previous speakers, that there is a distinction to be drawn between reporting facts and putting a construction on the evidence or the drawing of conclusions. That is precisely what the attorney general has repeatedly done in this answer. Tony Burke: The comment from the attorney general that that point of order was just raised against was - and I think I’m quoting precisely - those in power need to abide by the law. Now, it’s extraordinary that that’s controversial. And that does not need to be seen - that does not need to be seen through the lens of interpreting specific pieces of evidence. It can’t be the case that the standing orders don’t allow the attorney general to make clear that members of the government need to obey the law. Dick: I’m just gonna remind the attorney general not to make any conclusions or give his opinion about what happened at the royal commission, and if he’s got an answer relating to evidence, I ask him to provide that to the chamber. Otherwise, I will sit him down. He can, in conclusion, continue his answer. Dreyfus: Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. And let’s move away from the royal commission. When Labor came to government, it was very clear that there was an urgent need to restore integrity and transparency, which had been so badly eroded by the former Liberal government. The former Liberal government reneged on their promise to establish a National Anti-Corruption Commission. They ignored calls for a robodebt royal commission. The Albanese Labor government has been left with a very big clean-up job to do. But we’ve already made very important progress, including by legislating for a National Anti-Corruption Commission that will be up and running in coming months. The robodebt debacle is one shocking example of what can happen when governments throw accountability above the law. It must never happen again. The National MP for Mallee, Dr Anne Webster has the next non-government question: My question is to the prime minister: for more than 20 years, Ian Mortlock has operated a tomato-growing business in my electorate. Under this government, Ian’s company endured a 400% rise in gas prices for his last contract. He has been quoted a new price, but despite the government’s much-hyped gas price caps, it’s still so high it will damage his business. The prime minister promised Australians like Ian that he would cut their power bills by $275. Why has the prime minister misled the Australian people? Isn’t this yet another broken promise by this tricky prime minister? Milton Dick says the member was “well out of time with that question” and asks her to repeat the end – which she does – and Dick makes the point it is broad, but allows it. Albanese: We brought the parliament back last December to put a cap on gas prices. We put it back. The members opposite voted against it. The members opposite also voted against the $1.5bn of energy price relief. So, I hope that the member tells her company that she voted against the company on gas prices and that she voted against the $1.5bn of energy price relief. To the question: Dr Monique Ryan: My question is for the minister for health: Minister, Australians are struggling with the cost-of-living pressures. In 2018, the PBAC recommended allowing prescribing of two months at a time supply for 143 medications. This would save dispensing fees of up to $180 a year per prescription medicine and will take pressure off GPs. Will you commit to decreasing healthcare costs by making this change to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (Pbac) Mark Butler: Well, you’d think they’d have learned about interjecting on the member for Kooyong! This is an opposition that doesn’t appear to learn, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for Kooyong for her question. And I appreciate the contribution that members of the crossbench, particularly those with such long experience as health professionals, are making to a really difficult debate about healthcare right now. It’s never been harder to see a doctor, it’s never been more expensive to see a doctor, and at a time of really severe cost-of-living pressures, just those basic questions about whether you can take a script to your pharmacist and have it filled or whether that will place too much of a burden on your household budget are real pressures on hundreds of thousands of Australians. We’ve heard from the ABS that almost a million Australians every year either defer or go without a script that their doctor has given them as important for their health because of household budget pressures. Now, for the first time in 75 years, on 1 January, there was a substantial cut to the price of general patient scripts, down from $42.50 to $30, and already that has saved tens of millions of dollars for many, many Australians. Made a real difference not only to the household budget but, importantly, to their healthcare as well. The member for Kooyong is right - the PBAC has made other suggestions about ways in which that cost-of-living pressure but also the convenience, the convenience of patients can be improved, and those pressures can be alleviated, in terms of the number of times they need to go to GPs, get scripts, or go to the pharmacist to have their medicines topped up. We’re obviously looking at all of those options. There’s a budget process under way. We’re looking at all of the options available to government to make access to healthcare better and easier for patients, and to make the cost of healthcare, including the cost of medicines, even cheaper. So, I’m not in a position to make any particular announcements this afternoon, Mr Speaker, but I thank the member for Kooyong for her question. These are all matters that we take very, very seriously because we know, in spite of the fact that the change we introduced on 1 January has already had an enormous impact, enormous beneficial impact on patients, a change supported very strongly by the community pharmacy sector, there is much more we can do, and we’re examining all of those options very closely. Butler then gets into a back and forth with opposition MPs asking them why they didn’t do anything when they were in government when they criticise his answer. Independent Kooyong MP, Dr Monique Ryan has the next crossbench question and there is a bit of a back and forth between an opposition heckler (Paul and I didn’t catch who) and the good doctor, who has already proven in the chamber she can very quickly shut down attempts to heckle. Milton Dick gives the call to the member for Kooyong and then the opposition wannabe comedian uses it as an opportunity to make a crack about ‘calling the prime minister’. (If you don’t understand that reference, you’ll find the context in here) Ryan asks the heckler to repeat themselves as there was a lot of noise and fires back “I’ll be there before you” which earns the praise of the Labor side of the chamber. Sussan Ley throws in “Kooyong forever” for… reasons. WA Liberal Rick Wilson was booted out during that question and then Michael Sukkar and Anthony Albanese had a nice back and forth across the table: Sukkar: “Rule it out tough guy”. Albanese: “How’s it going in Aston?” This is not a chamber for grown ups. Liberal member for Flinders, Zoe McKenzie has the next non-government question: The prime minister said he would stand by the stage-three tax cuts. Will the prime minister rule out any changes to the stage-three tax cuts or will this be the next broken promise from this tricky prime minister? Anthony Albanese: I thank the member for Flinders for her question. And we’ve made our priority very clear, and so have the Liberals. We now have the first commitment from the leader of the opposition, which is on tax issues. He will - he will, if he’s successful at the next election... with support, I assume, of the member for Flinders if she’s successful, he will introduce - he will introduce better tax concessions for those people who have $100m in their bank account. In their super account. So, finally, having gone through an entire almost a year as opposition leader, having had his first budget reply without having a single policy to put forward... (Dutton interjects with “rule it out”. Dutton: “very tricky!”) We now have one. And we expected some questions about it today. There is a point of order from Paul Fletcher, which Milton Dick says is not a point of order and Albanese continues. Of course, we haven’t changed our position on that issue. But we do find... He won’t fight for those veterans at risk of homelessness, that we just discussed about. He won’t fight for those women and children escaping domestic violence, who will benefit from the Housing Australia Future Fund. He won’t fight for those people in regional Australia who want manufacturing jobs in the National Reconstruction Fund. He won’t fight for those businesses who are calling for certainty with the Safeguard Mechanism. He won’t fight for those families who want cheaper childcare. He wouldn’t fight for those families who will benefit from energy price relief. No to all of them. We’ve found a group that he will fight for - the 17 Australians who have over $100m in their superannuation accounts, and the one Australian - he probably knows who it is - who has over $400m in his super account. I mean... they have consistently opposed absolutely everything, but finally they’ve found something that they’re in favour of. But they come in here, having got on every interview with a friendly journalist they could find over the last week. They come in here and it’s almost radio silence on super. The Greens MP for Ryan, Elizabeth Watson-Brown has the next crossbench question and its to Tanya Plibersek: My question is to the environment minister: Recently, you quietly issued, late on a Friday afternoon, your decision to approve Labor party donor Santos a licence to frack 116 new gas wells in Queensland until 2077. The International Energy Agency recently showed that Australia’s methane emissions from coal and gas could be 60% higher than now accounted for. Why are you approving new gas wells that will make the climate crisis worse? Plibersek: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. And I think the first thing to say is that imputation is unworthy and insulting. The second thing I’d like to point out to the honourable member is that the project she’s talking about is a 1.3% expansion of a project that’s been going for eight years. To listen to the member opposite, you’d think it was something quite different. But I will say to the Greens, as they’re sitting there feeling self-righteous, that the very best thing the Greens political party could do, if they were really interested in climate change in this country, is back the government’s safeguard mechanism. Those sitting up there in that corner should not make the same mistake they made it 2009, when they voted with Tony Abbott and Barnaby Joyce to block action on climate change. Because what they delivered last time was more emissions for longer, and a Liberal government. That’s what they delivered last time. I am proud of what we’re doing on this side of the parliament. It’s the Albanese Labor government that is delivering real action on climate change with a legislated path to net zero emissions. With a pledge on methane, with real action to protect the ozone layer, with $20bn to rewire the nation so we can put more renewable energy into our electricity market. With $3bn in the National Reconstruction Fund to support low-emissions technologies. Are you gonna vote for that? Are you gonna vote for the $3bn for low-emissions technologies? Why don’t you answer that question? The best thing those opposite can do, if they sincerely want to see real action on climate change, is support the government’s Safeguard Mechanism, don’t make the same mistake as 2009, back the National Reconstruction Fund, and get on board for our measures addressing climate change. Paul Karp is in the chamber and heard the heckles of “afraid of the debate” and “where’s the transparency” from Peter Dutton in response to Tony Burke. Karp says that Dutton looked up at the press gallery deliberately after that, to make sure they caught it. The not-prime minister, Peter Dutton, is now trying to suspend standing orders to debate “that before the election the prime minister promised on 97 occasions to reduce Australians’ power bills by $275. But instead power bills have increased since he became prime minister. Before the election, the prime minister promised Australians cheaper mortgages, but instead there have been eight successive increases in mortgage interest rates since he became prime minister…and notes that, as a result of the prime minister’s conduct, Australians are now unable to trust any of the promises he made, and therefore, four, calls on the prime minister to keep the promises he has made, including in relation to reduced power bills, cheaper mortgages, and not introducing new taxes on superannuation.” (There are other cost of living hits that form part of the motion, but you get the idea) Leave is not granted, so Dutton is about to launch into his speech, but Tony Burke, who seems to know parliamentary procedure better than almost anyone (outside of Anthony Albanese) knows how to use Practice to get his own way and doesn’t gag the debate (which was the former government’s favourite way of dealing with pesky motions to suspend standing orders) but instead, sends it to after QT. Under standing order 47(e), I require that this debate be continued at the conclusion of Question Time. And so the debate is not gagged, but Dutton has to sit down and it will be held after QT. Speaker Milton Dick is having an absolute pearler of a bad day today – after calling treasurer Jim Chalmers, “premier” he just referred to Peter Dutton as “prime minister”. There is just too much Queensland in the chamber for Dick this afternoon, it seems. Angus Taylor is up next with a question for….Anthony Albanese. My question is to the prime minister: on 30 March 2021, the prime minister said, “We won’t have any changes to the franking credits regime.” Why has the prime minister misled the Australian people? Isn’t this yet another broken promise from a tricky prime minister? There are the usual groans that the question isn’t for Jim Chalmers. Albanese: [It was] proposed by the former government. But then again, then again, the shadow treasurer, I mean, the treasurer’s been waiting patiently there since last November to get a single question. Last November! It’s now March. It was his birthday last week! It was his birthday! On the same day! Give him a question! Give him a question - that’s all he asks. That’s all he asks for, Mr Speaker …I would have thought - I would have thought that the shadow treasurer might have asked a question about super. He’s had a lot to say. He’s had a lot to say about super. He’s had a lot to say about super, Mr The prime minister will return to the question. But apparently not. Well, he’s just picked another argument with himself. But he picked an argument with himself accidentally, accidentally last week as well for the entire week. At last, a fair fight. At last, a fair fight. A fight between the shadow treasurer with the shadow treasurer. I think they’ve only got one. I think they’ve only got one now. Angus versus Angus. A true battle of the lightweights. One of the issues with the government intervention in the energy market is that power prices will still go up – they just won’t go up by as much as they were going to. And it is hard to convince people of a saving if they don’t see it. Still though, without the intervention, power prices would have skyrocketed and the Coalition DID vote against it. But the Coalition is banking on the fact that not many people take in that much about political debate – and that includes taking who votes for what (or who doesn’t vote for something) into account. PM says Liberal party ‘voted against $1.5bn of energy price relief’ The member for Cowper, Pat Conaghan, has a question for Anthony Albanese: Ross and Cynthia are aged pensioners who live in South West Rocks in my electorate. This week, they were told by their provider their new power bill is about to skyrocket by more than 40% to $474 per quarter. The prime minister promised Australians like Ross and Cynthia that he would cut their power bills by $275. Why has the prime minister misled the Australian people? And isn’t this yet another broken promise by this tricky prime minister? “Tricky prime minister” seems to be the phrase of the day. What a time. Albanese: I thank the member for his question, and I do hope that the member told Ross and Cynthia that he voted against $1.5 billion of energy price relief. I hope he did. I hope he did. That was a plan that went through … every state and territory leader – Labor and Liberal – it’s true there were no Nats there, so we don’t know where the Nats would have stood. But every state Liberal leader, including the premier of New South Wales, voted for this plan. And, indeed, responsible oppositions, such as the New South Wales opposition, voted for the plan as well. And you know what’s happened as a result of the plan is that, as a result of us announcing it … wholesale prices have halved as a result … And this is what Philip Lowe, the RBA governor, had to say just last week. He said this: ‘This episode of high inflation has its origins mainly in developments on the supply side’ – something that the minister for industry was just talking about. ‘But, over time, demand-side factors have become more prominent. It emerged in the wake of the Covid supply chain disruptions and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine’ – that is what the Reserve Bank governor said last Friday. Now, we are dealing with that in a practical way. We brought forward legislation, indeed brought the parliament back here last December for extraordinary action due to the extraordinary circumstances which were there. You didn’t. You voted against $1.5 billion of assistance, and I hope you’ve told your constituents that. Mark Dreyfus: Government committed to ‘merit-based, transparent appointment processes’ Dr Sophie Scamps has one of the crossbench questions today: My question is for the attorney general: This morning, I introduced a bill to end the jobs-for-mates culture in federal politics. Having abolished the AAT because of rampant cronyism and announced a review into public board appointments, it appears the government agrees this is a major integrity problem. Without a process like I proposed in my bill, how can the government guarantee any future appointments to public institutions will not end up as more jobs for mates? Mark Dreyfus: I thank the member very much for her question. As she knows, we have met to discuss her private member’s bill, and as I have explained to her, and would explain to the House, we as a government are committed to merit-based, transparent appointment processes. You will see those merit-based, transparent appointment processes in all respects in the appointments of this government. Mehreen Faruqi: ‘Anything less’ than paid parental leave for PhD students ‘will be a pretty cruel oversight’ Greens Senator for higher education, Mehreen Faruqi has urged the Senate to adopt her move to amend the paid parental leave scheme to include PhD candidates. Faruqi told the Senate on Monday PhD candidates “often fall through the cracks” and she could think of “no good rationale” for excluding the cohort. Despite often conducting research on a full-time basis, they cannot access the same parental leave entitlements as other working parents. I will be introducing amendments to fix this. As a PhD student who had a baby while doing my research and a former academic who is passionate about the importance of research, this matter is very close to my heart. PhD candidates are eligible for a university stipend through the government research training program at $29,863 without tax, well below the minimum wage. Universities have the option to top this amount up but data on 189 of them found only 42 offered above the government stipend and none of them meet the minimum wage. Faruqi said in response to a written question on notice, the Department of Social Services advised the scheme was intended to support “working parents who have demonstrated attachment to the workforce”. That’s completely unreasonable. It is unfair to expect every PhD student in Australia has the opportunity to get paid work while they are studying full-time. That is just atrocious. PhD students are struggling to make ends meet amid the cost of living crisis and rising rents. In January this year, the Guardian reported PhD students are barely scraping by often relying on a partner to survive or being forced to eat instant noodles and work extra jobs during the night. We need to increase the stipend and we have the opportunity to include students in the paid parental leave scheme … Anything less will be a pretty cruel oversight by the government. The Greens will also move for parental leave to be paid at a person’s full wage, arguing the minimum wage was insufficient and discouraged men who were often higher paid from taking leave. The speaker, Milton Dick, was just asked to rule on a point of order from Paul Fletcher on a Jim Chalmers dixer. “I could not hear what the premier … uh, what the … Don’t tell the premier that!” Annastacia Palaszczuk is one of Dick’s best friends so seems the Queensland nexus (Queensland speaker, Queensland treasurer) just put Dick into a Queensland state of mind for a moment. (Which is obviously the best state of mind.) PM highlights shared equity scheme in response to question on cheaper mortgages Sussan Ley is up next (there is an absolute pattern in how the opposition handles questions and it involves Ley getting the second question) My question is to the prime minister, and I refer to his promise to deliver cheaper mortgages. Interest rates have risen eight times under his watch, and more Australians are turning to food bank so they can put their grocery money towards their mortgage payments. Why has this prime minister misled the Australian people? Isn’t this yet another broken promise by this tricky prime minister? (The focus groups might need to do a little more work on that moniker.) Anthony Albanese: Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. And perhaps if the deputy leader attends the New South Wales Liberal party launch on Sunday, and she might get to speak, then she will get to speak about the shared equity scheme, which I announced during our election campaign, and the shared equity scheme that is being promoted by the Liberal-National government in New South Wales. Shared equity schemes – what it means is, instead of having 100% of the mortgage yourself, a share of the mortgage is held by the government. That’s the scheme … that New South Wales’ Liberal government has announced. It’s based upon the WA Liberal party scheme. It’s based upon the Victorian scheme. The WA scheme has been in place for many, many decades and has been a huge success. And I thank the member for her question. Breaking in to question time for a moment: What about question time for the people? There is a dixer on what Labor has done while in government. Once again, this could be a press release. But we want to try to actually use the ridiculous attempts to hold on to dixers for good. If governments won’t take it seriously, then we will try to create the space to do that, and are hoping to create a reader question time where we will take a few questions each sitting week from you on what you want to know about your community and take them to the MPs. We hope they will take it seriously, and use the opportunity to actually answer your questions. Let me know what you think – you can reach me here and we will work out what form this all takes. We are straight into it – and if you had super as the first question on your bingo card, give yourself a little pat on the back. Peter Dutton asks if Labor’s proposed changes are a broken promise. Anthony Albanese says: I do thank the leader of the opposition for his question. We have made our priority clear and so has the leader of the opposition. Our priority is dealing with the trillion dollars of Liberal debt that we inherited off those opposite. We are making a very modest change that will impact one half of 1%. One half of 1%. Seventeen of those people have over $100 million in their account. One has over $400 million. So, I do note that a majority of Australians, including a majority of Liberal voters, say that they agree with this change. But I tell you what we won’t do. We see an issue of a trillion dollars of Liberal debt, we get advice from Treasury saying that there are these 17 people who have over $100 million in their account … and we say, “Well, we should do something about that.” Those opposite see the most vulnerable people in our community and introduced the robodebt scheme. And this is what they had to say: “We’ll find you, we’ll track you down, and you will have to repay those debts, and you may end up in prison.” That said it all about those opposite and their attitude towards this. We’re a government for all Australians. They have been reduced for a government of one half of 1%. ADF developing uncrewed surface vessels for use in the sea The ADF has taken delivery of its first Ocius BlueBottle uncrewed surface vessels, which seems like a drone for the sea. The Royal Australian Navy and Defence industry have worked together through a Defence Innovation Hub initiative to develop the Ocius BlueBottle USV, with two of the five vessels received. Minister Pat Conroy said: As a trading nation, surrounded by oceans, a sustained maritime security presence is essential for assuring our national economy. Autonomous capabilities and innovative technologies, such as the Ocius BlueBottle Uncrewed Surface Vessels, will assist our Navy in supporting Australian interests. Powered by the wind, waves and the sun, the Ocius BlueBottle can autonomously monitor designated areas for extended lengths of time. As a Gold Coaster, I am used to dodging bluebottles in the water and the shore, and avoiding strong onshore conditions (iykyk) but it seems these BlueBottles are more of the “don’t you worry about that” type. Good times: Forecast NSW power shortages fuel questions over buying back Eraring plant As we mentioned earlier, the low-intensity heatwave lapping eastern parts of NSW is expected to push up electricity demand. There’s a level 1 (low level) alert about a shortage of power in the state for this evening, which will probably be met. As tomorrow’s likely to be warm again (if not quite as hot), there’s also a lack of reserve at level 2 issued for tomorrow evening by the Australian Energy Market Operator. As it happens, debate is been stoked again about whether NSW should buy back its (and Australia’s) biggest coal-fired power station. Origin Energy’s Eraring plant. The Australian today reported NSW’s treasurer and energy minister, Matt Kean, as saying: “We will take the necessary steps to ensure there’s enough energy in the system to keep the lights on and drive prices down.” Kean declined to rule “things in or out”. A spokesperson for Kean’s office has sought to dispel unwarranted speculation: The government is not considering an extension of Eraring, which is entirely a matter for Origin Energy. Thanks to the Waratah Super Battery, there is no forecast gap in the reliability standard in 2025 For its part, Origin isn’t budging from their line of February 2022 that Eraring will shut in 2025, seven years early: “We’ll continue to assess the market over time and this will inform the final timing for closure of all four units.” Bear in mind that it costs $200-250m a year in maintenance work alone – quite apart from the fuel costs – to keep Eraring going, and you get a sense taxpayers might be up for a hefty bill if they did buy back a plant sold by the Coalition in 2013 for about $659m. Chris Minns, the NSW opposition leader who is hoping to become premier after the 25 March election, offered a cautious response when asked a bit prematurely how much he’d be willing to pay to take back the plant to extend its life. I’m not going to take anything off the table. I will not allow the lights to go out in NSW. Whether or not the government ever would buy back Eraring, Minns has sought to channel the issue into Labor’s broader rejection of the privatisation of state assets. We’re getting hosed as a result of those privatisations. Don’t elect a government that’s dumb enough to sell [assets like Eraring]. Kean’s spokesperson has described such comments as implying a “dangerous nationalisation of this power station for ideological reasons”. A major blackout might change the debate but odds must favour Eraring shutting in 2025 at this stage. Separately, the difference between future wholesale power prices in NSW and Queensland compared with Victoria and South Australia is getting wider, at least according to the latest numbers published by the ASX. The Albanese government, which has pointed to falling wholesale power prices as proof its energy market intervention to cap gas and coal prices was getting some traction, will be hoping those prices turn lower again. Over in the Senate and Dynamic Red (the Senate’s live business paper) tells me Labor’s paid parental leave scheme changes have passed the senate, although the Greens attempts to amend it, including to make it available for postgraduate work, have failed. We are now half an hour out from the first question time of the week. Huzzah. Bill introduced by Greens would allow stripping of governor general entitlements in cases of ‘serious misconduct’ The Greens senator David Shoebridge is introducing legislation to the Senate which would allow governments to strip former governors general of entitlements, if they are found to have “engaged in serious misconduct”. Shoebridge said former GGs found to have done wrong shouldn’t receive their $600,000 a year in entitlements. If someone is struggling to get by on $282 a week in jobseeker payments and they miss a job interview they get a warning; if they do it twice, they can have their payments halted. If a former governor general is convicted of a crime or is proven to engage in the most serious misconduct, they keep on receiving up to $600,000 a year in entitlements, that’s about $11,500 a week, no questions asked. Supporting this bill will show survivors that the parliament listens and understands, and will no longer allow laws that shield past or future abusers from consequences. The bill would need the government’s support to get anywhere. There has been no indication Labor will support it. Male-dominated occupations likely to have skills shortages, analysis shows Well, smash me down and call me avocado – there is a gender imbalance when it comes to the skills shortages. From Brendan O’Connor’s office: Analysis from Jobs and Skills Australia shows that occupations with skills shortages are likely to have significant gender imbalance in their workforce, particularly towards male-dominated occupations. For more than half of occupations in national shortage, women make up less than 20 per cent of their total workforce. These occupations include Metal Fitters and Machinists (1% female workforce); Motor Mechanics (2% female workforce); Electricians (2% female workforce); Mining Engineers (14% female workforce); Construction Managers (14% female workforce); and Software and Applications Programmers (19% female workforce). In contrast, for 14 per cent of occupations in national shortage, men make up less than 20 per cent of their total workforce. These occupations include Early Childhood Teachers (2% male workforce); Child Carers (3% male workforce); and Registered Nurses (12% male workforce). And lo and behold, that same analysis has found that when there isn’t a gender imbalance, there is less likely to be a skills shortage. Independent MPs call for rules on referendum pamphlet to include factchecking Back to the Referendum Machinery Act: the Indigenous Australians minister, Linda Burney, says the government will move its own amendments to the bill in the Senate. The exact basis of the pamphlet, for instance, is not yet clear, with some independent MPs like David Pocock and Zali Steggall calling for independent factchecking of the essays – but the government says the spirit of the amendments is to bring the Referendum Act into line with laws governing normal elections, which hints at there being no special factchecking apparatus. We’ll see what those amendments look like later on. Steggall spoke in the house right after Burney, raising again her concerns about truth in political advertising and factchecking: “It really should happen,” she said of the need to avoid misinformation in the campaign. The Warringah MP claimed people felt “cheated” that there were no rules outlawing lies in political ads. The government knows it needs to protect truth but is failing to do that. If this isn’t the right time, when will be? Review of social media cybersecurity on government devices due within weeks Just returning to the issue of TikTok on government devices: Last year the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, asked her department to review the cybersecurity implications of all forms of social media on government devices. That obviously includes TikTok but is not limited to it. We’re told the review isn’t far off. It is understood the Department of Home Affairs is likely to hand its report to O’Neil within weeks. Albanese to join Universities Australia chief Catriona Jackson on India visit this week Visit comes as the government turns its sights on the education sector. It follows a university delegation to India last week, led by education minister Jason Clare, where he signed an expansive mutual qualifications agreement with his counterpart and 11 memorandas of understanding were signed between Australian and Indian educators. Jackson said higher education and research were “central pillars” of the Australia-India relationship. Jackson: Universities fully support the government’s focus on strengthening Australia’s ties with India – one of the fastest growing economies in the world and a very important strategic partner. We especially welcome education being front and centre as our governments move to strengthen the bilateral relationship. India is undertaking sweeping reforms of its education sector and they want our help. India’s new education plan includes the goal of educating 500 million students by 2035, while also encouraging international universities to establish campuses onshore. It’s in our national interest to continue strengthening our trade links, and we can do that by educating Indian students in Australia, research collaborations and through our universities having a physical presence in India. It’s clear we are entering a golden era in our trade relationship with India, and we must make the most of it for the social, diplomatic and economic benefit of both our nations. Jackson said there were now more Indian students studying in Australia than before the pandemic, making India Australia’s second largest and fastest growing international student market. Data released by the Department of Education found international student fees were the second highest source of revenue for universities behind government funding, bringing in $8.7bn in revenue. At some institutions, international students accounted for more than 40% of yearly income. Linda Burney asks Coalition to ‘meet us halfway’ on voice referendum amendments Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney has asked the Coalition to “meet us halfway” and support the changes to the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act, after shadow treasurer Angus Taylor said the opposition would stand against the amendments until more of its demands were met. Burney said the government had made a “significant concession” by reinstating the official information pamphlet, setting out the official cases of the yes and no side, and called on the Coalition to compromise. To step back for a minute: there are two bills the government needs to pass before setting up the voice to parliament referendum. There’s the constitutional amendment bill, which sets out the question and the exact wording to be inserted into the constitution, which will come later this month; but first there’s the Referendum Machinery Act changes, the rules governing the vote. The government planned to modernise that act, by updating rules around financial disclosures, banning foreign campaigners, and initial plans to scrap the official 2,000-word essays mailed out to every household. After Coalition criticism, the government agreed to bring back the pamphlet. But the Coalition also wants to have public funding given to both the official yes and no sides. The government hoped bringing back the pamphlet would be enough to win back the opposition, but in a speech to parliament this morning, Taylor said the Coalition still planned to oppose the bill unless the government set up and funded official campaign bodies. Burney, speaking right afterwards, noted the government had already changed its plans after Coalition suggestions: “I hope the opposition sees this and meets us halfway to support this legislation”. Labor doesn’t necessarily need the Coalition to back the bill, as the Greens have already pledged support - but the government is keen to try and get some level of bipartisanship on the referendum. Malcolm Turnbull has joined the ranks of podcasters He has joined LiSTNR with “Defending Democracy with Malcolm Turnbull’, a six-part podcast series with “key global and local political figures and commentators including former British prime minister Theresa May, former US Republican Party congressman Adam Kinzinger, veteran Homeland Security official John Cohen, Australian Members of Parliament Allegra Spender MP and Zali Steggall MP, journalist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa, and American author and expert on Russian disinformation Nina Jankowicz”. Don’t expect Turnbull and guests to sit around smoking cigars while bragging about their gains. Together they question if liberal democracies can prevail against populist authoritarians. Can we stop the madness of the ‘angertainment’ industry without stifling free speech? What lessons can Americans learn from Australian democracy and what warnings can Australians take from America, from Europe and closer to home here in Asia? The first two episodes are out where you get your podcasts. Paterson on TikTok use by federal agencies: ‘It doesn’t have to be a government-wide ban’ James Paterson was asked if there was room for nuance in this debate in terms of a ban on all agencies. A journalist pointed out that some agencies like the National Gallery and Tourism Australia have said that they use TikTok for marketing and outreach purposes. The Liberal senator replied: I think some exceptions could be granted in exceptional circumstances. It doesn’t have to be a government-wide ban. But at the moment, there’s not a clear direction centrally from government. It appears that individual departments and agencies are making their own decisions about that and it’s not clear that that’s informed by the best advice and that they’re considering that advice. Asked how many agencies had TikTok bans and restrictions in place at the time of the change of government last May - whether more may have actually taken action since Labor took office - the former chair of the intelligence and security committee said: I don’t know. I’ve only asked these questions now that I’ve got the opportunity to as the shadow minister for cybersecurity, this has never been previously asked or publicised. Q: Why didn’t your government take more action on this? It seems like after the fact now you’re calling on the government to do it when your government could have taken stronger action? Well, there’s been two key developments since the election. The first was in July last year, when I wrote to TikTok, and I asked them, ‘Do you allow Australian user data to be accessed in China?’ And they acknowledged in the reply to me that they did. That was the first time the company had ever admitted publicly that that happens. Paterson also cited a report by Forbes in December 2022 that said an internal investigation by ByteDance - TikTok’s parent company - found employees tracked multiple journalists covering the company in an attempt to identify whether they had been in the same locales as ByteDance employees. At the time, a spokesperson for TikTok told Forbes: The misconduct of certain individuals, who are no longer employed at ByteDance, was an egregious misuse of their authority to obtain access to user data. This misbehaviour is unacceptable, and not in line with our efforts across TikTok to earn the trust of our users. The office of the minister for home affairs, Clare O’Neil, and ByteDance have been contacted for comment. Liberal James Paterson: Labor has ‘haphazard and inconsistent approach’ to TikTok security The Liberal senator James Paterson is on the warpath today regarding TikTok on government devices. Paterson, who is the shadow minister for cybersecurity and countering foreign interference, held a press conference in the Senate courtyard to outline figures based on questions he had asked a range of government agencies and departments. Paterson said 25 Australian government agencies had banned TikTok entirely on employees’ devices, 12 had imposed partial restrictions, 11 permitted TikTok, while five either didn’t respond or gave vague answers: This is a haphazard and inconsistent approach from the Albanese government and we need clear action from them on this issue. For eight months now, since July last year*, I’ve been calling on them to act to protect Australians from the serious national security risks posed by TikTok. Had they acted then, Australia could have led the world like we did with Huawei when we banned it [from the 5G network] in 2018, a decision which has been vindicated by many other countries following our lead. * That would be from two months after the Coalition government lost office. Paterson said Australia’s friends and allies were acting on TikTok and that showed it was “a very serious threat and we need to address it”: And the question that the Albanese government and the minister for Home Affairs and Cyber Security, Clare O’Neil, has to answer is: if it’s not safe to be on the phone of a Canadian or American or European bureaucrat, why is it safe to be on the phone of an Australian government bureaucrat? ... I hope the government is not tolerating unacceptable national security risks for the sake of the bilateral relationship [with China]. Malcolm Turnbull has told a royal commission he didn’t turn his mind to the legality of the robodebt scheme, saying it never occurred to him that it was “unauthorised”. The former prime minister told the inquiry on Monday: My concern was essentially accuracy and fairness … we didn’t turn our mind to legality or lawfulness because we assumed [it] was how it had been represented [legal]. I did not turn my mind to the legality of the program It never occurred that it was unauthorised. The decision to implement robodebt was made by Tony Abbott’s cabinet for the May 2015 budget, but the scheme was launched at scale during Turnbull’s prime ministership. Turnbull pointed to the 2015 cabinet submission brought by then social services minister, Scott Morrison, “which expressly stated” that “no legislation is required”. The representation ... is legislation is not required. It’s clear what it says. Other ministers responsible for the scheme, including Alan Tudge, have also pointed to the checklist, telling the royal commission they were essentially misled by the public service. The inquiry continues. Appearing at a royal commission on Monday, Turnbull spoke to WhatsApp messages of discussions between the then prime minister and key ministers Alan Tudge and Christian Porter at the initial height of the scandal in early 2017. His statement includes a 7 January 2017 message Turnbull sent with a link to a Sydney Morning Herald article by Peter Martin, which suggested the program could be unlawful. Tudge replied in the exchange by saying “it is not correct that we simply take the average of the income declared to ATO and apply that average across 26 fortnight”. Despite Tudge’s explanation, the commissioner, Catherine Holmes ACS, told the inquiry on Monday that was how the scheme often worked. Asked if it became apparent that’s what was happening, Turnbull said he didn’t “recall that”. More broadly, Turnbull said he had accepted what Tudge had said as the “responsible minister”. Asked if he believed Tudge had a good grasp on how the system worked, Turnbull said: “Alan Tudge, I always regarded as a technocrat. He was a management consultant. I didn’t regard him as being a negligent or incompetent or careless minister.” Turnbull told the inquiry that later, on 20 January 2017, he messaged Tudge saying they needed a “frank assessment of what the problems are and what is happening to fix them.” Turnbull said he was pressing Tudge to do his job and queried whether the department was giving him the right information. Turnbull also defended the scheme at a press conference on 18 January 2017, later messaging Tudge to ask if he had answered “correctly”. Turnbull said he had little independent recollection of the time aside from the WhatsApp messages and other documents. The inquiry continues. Acoss says indexed jobseeker still ‘well below the poverty line’ The Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) also has thoughts on the indexation changes to welfare payments: This increase will not deal with the fact that jobseeker is not enough to cover food, utilities and medicines, not to mention keep up with the cost of essentials, with rent up by more than 10 per cent, food by 9.2 per cent and electricity up 8.6 per cent in the 12 months to December. The jobseeker indexation increase is just $1.77 a day, taking the payment for a single person from $48 to $50 day. The payment will still be 57 per cent below the minimum wage, 34 per cent below the pension and well below the poverty line. People receiving youth allowance - currently $40 a day - will not receive any increase, as youth allowance and other student payments are only indexed once a year. Acoss acting CEO Edwina MacDonald said the only solution is real change: People on jobseeker and related payments cannot afford to eat enough, cannot get essential medication or healthcare, and often go into debt to pay their energy bills. The inadequacy of these payments directly corrodes people’s capacity and confidence. Being forced to go without the basics like enough food impairs people’s ability to look for paid work and engage in their community. ‘Crowing about indexation is a slap in the face,’ says Antipoverty Centre The Antipoverty Centre has had enough of governments claiming indexation changes as “increases”. Welfare payment indexation is linked to the Consumer Price Index, which was 7.8% in the December quarter. But ‘non-discretionary’ inflation is currently 8.4%. Even that doesn’t reflect reality because it includes so many items we simply go without because we cannot afford them. Inflation does not capture that living in poverty is more expensive because we are generally forced to buy smaller quantities with higher unit prices. Another flaw in the ABS’s measure is rent price inflation, which ignores the disproportionately higher costs borne by low-income tenants. For example, the ABS puts rent inflation at 3.3% in Sydney for the year to December 2022. However, rents in the greater Sydney area have increased by 10% above inflation, based on bonds lodgement data published by the NSW Tenants’ Union. Many tenants are suffering eye-watering increases that are not captured in this data because no new bond has been lodged. Enough about indexation. Crowing about it is a slap in the face. Indexed welfare payments rise with CPI The slight rise to welfare payments is all down to indexation – the cost of living goes up, so there is a slight increase to indexed payments. But it works out to about an extra $1.70 a day – which is not a material change to people’s living situations. Here is how minister Amanda Rishworth has explained it: More than 4.7 million pension and allowance recipients will receive a boost to their social security payments when indexation of their payments occurs on 20 March 2023. Recipients of Age Pension, Disability Support Pension and Carer Payment can expect an increase of $37.50 a fortnight for singles and $56.40 a fortnight for couples combined. The maximum fortnightly rate of pension will increase to $1064 for singles and $1604 for couples, including Pension Supplement and Energy Supplement. JobSeeker Payment and adult ABSTUDY payment rates will also be indexed. Single JobSeeker Payment and ABSTUDY recipients aged over 22 and without children will receive $701.90 per fortnight including Energy Supplement, reflecting a $24.70 increase. Each member of a couple in receipt of JobSeeker Payment and ABSTUDY will benefit from an additional $22.50 per fortnight, with the fortnightly rate increasing to $639.10 including Energy Supplement. More on Turnbull at robodebt inquiry Luke Henriques-Gomes is watching Malcolm Turnbull’s appearance at the royal commission and will send through a post or two. A reminder though that comments count as publishing and we have to be careful when it comes to legal risk. It’s about keeping us all legally safe and also ensuring no interference with the commission. Thanks everyone. More on voice funding debate Paul Karp has an update: The Albanese government has authorised $9.5m of spending for a voice civics and awareness campaign to include the “facts of the voice” but insists it is not funding a de facto yes campaign. The new $9.5m was contained in the “decisions taken but not announced” section of October’s budget, revealed in a legislative instrument made by the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, on Thursday. The funding has fuelled controversy over Labor’s decision not to provide public funding to the yes and no campaigns, as the shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, has warned the government appears to be tipping the scales in favour of the yes case. ‘No easy fixes’ for inflation problem, finance report says With the Reserve Bank heavily favoured to lift its key interest tomorrow (making it 10 rises in a row), attention is shifting fitfully towards alternatives to quelling inflation by squeezing borrowers. Research out this morning by Canstar found 68% of mortgage holders and 65% of renters are feeling financially stressed. Apparently one in 10 have missed at least one mortgage repayment or rent instalment or other bill repayment since the RBA’s rate hikes began last May. Also, 54% of the 3,100 surveyed said more rate rises were not the solution to cutting consumer spending and reining-in inflation. That was up 10 percentage points in three months, from a 44% reading then. There is a sense of urgency added when you consider that around one-third of all home loan debt is on loans taken out over the last two years when property prices were high,” says Canstar’s finance expert Steve Mickenberger. Values are now being whittled back and disappearing equity is piling on further pressure.” Mickenberger says the RBA – and other central banks – had “totally underestimated” the inflation pressures building in the system that were made worse by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago. Alas, Canstar did not ask respondents what policies might do a better jobs. Mickenberger: There are no easy fixes to this … It’s reflective of what’s happening elsewhere in the world, which says that no one’s come up with the silver bullet for that. More than 30 New South Wales schools across the central tablelands have been closed for the day due to bushfire risk. The education minister, Sarah Mitchell, said the Department of Education had taken the advice of the Rural Fire Service to close 32 schools. She said: It’s really about taking that precaution and making sure that we don’t put any of our students at risk. We’ll get updated advice from the RFS throughout the course of the day. There’s an extreme fire danger warning in that area. Former PM Malcolm Turnbull will give his testimony to the robodebt royal commission today – he is appearing by videolink, so won’t be in Brisbane. We will cover his appearance for you right here in the blog and, as always, Luke Henriques-Gomes will report on everything that happens with the royal commission. Mehreen Faruqi to move for paid parental leave bill to include postgraduate students The Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi will move an amendment today expanding the class of people who can claim paid parental leave to PhD students. In the Senate, Faruqi will request “eligible postgraduate work” be included in the paid parental leave bill alongside the “paid workforce”, enabling PhD candidates to access the same leave entitlements as the workforce. PhD candidates receive a stipend from their universities for their research and are considered students, not workers, preventing them from accessing the government’s 18-week paid parental leave scheme. Her amendment suggests postgraduate students should be eligible for the leave if they’re enrolled in a course of study or research for a doctoral degree and perform study or research for the purposes of that course, whether within or outside Australia. It follows a Guardian Australia report in January which found PhD candidates were increasingly struggling to make ends meet, with stipends for single people falling well below the minimum wage. PhD candidate Maddy Hoffman, then four months pregnant, discovered being a scholarship holder meant she was entitled to a maximum of 12 weeks paid maternity leave through her research program, and no antenatal care. She told Guardian Australia: If you want more time, you have to stop studying and get 0% of your scholarship. I was shocked. It’s been the most stressful point of the whole pregnancy. Apparently, a PhD does not count as work. In case you didn’t see this yesterday, it is very well worth your time reading this piece from Graham Readfearn – particularly as the safeguards legislation negotiations continue. Voter support for super tax changes doesn’t indicate appetite for other reforms: Burke Voters are in favour of the concession tax changes to super earnings over $3m (it is still a concessional rate, in that you are not paying what you would in income tax, but instead of paying 15%, those with balances of $3m or more pay 30% on future earnings) but Tony Burke says that doesn’t mean voters want to see further tax reform. I guess it depends on what your personal situation is when it comes to that. Do you have a house? A plan for retirement? Any way of getting ahead? A chance of inheriting anything other than your parent’s debt? An opportunity to buy a house in the area you’d like to live in? It’s all relative. But the lessons of 2019 have maybe been learned a little too well (if they were the right lessons in the first place) and Burke shut down tax reform very quickly this morning while speaking to ABC radio RN Breakfast. Q: This morning, Newspoll has shown two‑thirds of voters support your changes to super, including 80% of Labor voters, and also actually a majority of Coalition voters. Are you buoyed by the response? Burke: I think that matches what we’re getting in the community. People understand that a trillion dollars of Liberal debt doesn’t look after itself and there are different ways you can go to try to deal with the debt that you face. You can have modest revenue‑raising measures like this one is; you can do what you can to grow the economy, which is what things like the Reconstruction Fund are about; or you can try to make cuts like the previous government did with robodebt. When people look at the different options, I think people can see this is a pretty sensible, calm response to it. Q: Do you see it as evidence that voters have an appetite for more reform, more changes to taxation, particularly at the higher end? Burke: I think you’ve got to be careful of over‑reading what’s there at the moment. I think the fact that this has been a modest, calm, balanced change, I think, is part of the support that it’s receiving. Q: So, what are you saying? That this should not be seen as evidence that Australians have an appetite for broader tax reform? Burke: I think when you’re getting a good response about a particular proposal, then the response is about that proposal that’s in front of people. I just don’t think you can draw too much further than that. The independents are really kicking things off in parliament this morning – Zali Steggall is moving a motion calling on the government to enact effective methane regulations to stop gas leakage. Senator James Paterson: ‘No question TikTok is a serious national security threat’ Over on Melbourne radio 3AW, Liberal senator and security hawk James Paterson has his eyes on threats to national security – in this case, TikTok. And what he says is the government’s inaction on the social media site by not making a blanket ban on departments using it. There’s no question TikTok is a serious national security threat. TikTok is a company which is very close to the Chinese Communist party, and like all companies ultimately headquartered in China, is subject to China’s national security laws, including its 2017 National Intelligence law, which says that all Chinese citizens and Chinese organisations and companies must … cooperate with Chinese intelligence services if they are requested to do so. Now, given those risks, many of our close allies and friends like the United States, the European Union, Canada, Denmark and others have now banned TikTok from all government devices. And in July last year I wrote to TikTok to ask them whether Australian user data was accessible in China, and they admitted it was. So, I shared that correspondence with the minister for home affairs and cybersecurity and encouraged her to act. Eight months on, the government has taken no action to protect Australians. Paterson has no evidence of any hacks of government departments or MPs. But he says there has been a case of a journalist who was critical of TikTok being surveilled. If they can do it for a journalist who is writing critical articles, why wouldn’t they do it for public servant? Paterson says he is not a wowser and is on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, but not TikTok. Ending jobs for mates bill addresses culture of cronyism, Sophie Scamps says Dr Sophie Scamps: The national anti corruption commission is a safety net; investigations will be activated in response to corruption allegations. We now need to take steps to prevent corruption and cronyism from happening in the first place. To do this, we must build integrity, accountability and transparency into every area of our political system. There are many changes this parliament needs to enact to that end, including addressing lobbying and donation reforms and implementing stronger protections for whistleblowers. This bill that I’m introducing today addresses the culture of cronyism and party-friendly appointments that have distorted and undermined our democracy. My ending jobs for mates bill will establish a framework to ensure that major public commonwealth appointments are made independently and transparently, and that appointees are of the highest quality and expertise. This bill would mean that appointments are no longer left entirely to the discretion of the minister, and so would end the ‘jobs for mates’ culture that has plagued our political system. Independent MP Dr Sophie Scamps will be introducing her “ending jobs for mates” bill to the parliament right about … nowish. The private member’s bill has been drafted in conjunction with the Centre for Public Integrity and seeks to ensure government appointments are done independently and not handed out as little treats to political party favourites. Dr Helen Haines will be supporting the bill, with members of the crossbench, including Zali Steggall, Kylea Tink and Dr Monique Ryan also standing in favour of the bill. Plibersek ‘not going to offer a running commentary’ on claim she would have won Labor leadership in 2019 Tanya Plibersek was pushed on that, given the leadership titbit in the book, which is something that Barnaby Joyce was very keen to pursue. (Anthony Albanese’s Newspoll approval rating has dropped two points to 55%, which is the second month it has fallen. Not unusual as voters get used to new prime ministers and the reality of governing means the shine wears off, but the opposition is looking to see if it can start any sort of leadership issues.) Q: From your personal story to the political side of this, you also said you were confident that if you had run, you would have won the leadership battle. Does this make it a little awkward for your relationship with the current prime minister? Plibersek: Look, I’ve said from the very beginning that I’m not going to offer a running commentary on this. I’ve been really clear. I think politicians talking about themselves is the most boring thing in the world – Q: But you kind of have here. Plibersek: Well, there’s a book that I didn’t want written – Q: But did you say that, though. Plibersek: And a series of news stories … have flowed from that, but I’m not going to offer a running commentary. I would much rather be talking about the issues that are facing Australia today, not ancient history – the issues that are facing Australia today. We’ve been left, Australian taxpayers have been left with close to a trillion dollars of debt by Barnaby’s government. We’ve got to get on top of that. We know that cost of living is really affecting Australian families – Joyce: Well, you’re not helping that, are you? Plibersek: We’ve got all sorts of issues before us as a nation. That is my focus every minute of every working day. ‘I hope that others will see that there’s support available’: Plibersek on daughter Anna’s work after surviving abusive relationship Tanya Plibersek is the government minister who has the enviable job of fronting up to the Seven network to “debate” Barnaby Joyce each week. Should one person be granted so much single joy each week? That’s a question for another day. Among today’s delight, Joyce could barely contain his delight in bringing up a section of journalist Margaret Simons’ biography of Plibersek, which was published in the Nine newspapers this weekend. The book includes Plibersek talking about her daughter Anna’s experience with an abusive relationship and how Anna decided to share her story in order to help others. Plibersek is quoted in the book saying she pulled out of the contest for the Labor leadership in 2019 so she could be there for her daughter. Asked whether she could have clinched the leadership from Anthony Albanese at the time, Plibersek said “we’ll never know” but that she was confident “that if I had run, I would have won”. Tanya Plibersek: On Her Own Terms is out this week on Monday. Plibersek said it was a book she never wanted written. Just to be clear, this comes from a book that I didn’t want written. I made very clear to the author at the time that I didn’t want it written. She’s written a similar book about Penny Wong. Penny also didn’t want that book to be written. But one of the, I guess, the only good thing to come out of telling this story is the opportunity to talk about the amazing work that Anna and some other volunteers are doing in setting up an organisation – a peer‑led survivor support organisation called The Survivor Hub that helps people who are going through either talking to police, going through the court process, after they’ve experienced sexual assault or family violence. And I think the really important thing to say is that this is a story that touches so many Australian families. We know the statistics – about one in five Australian women over the age of 15 has experienced sexual violence. And I think by telling Anna’s story and a little bit about the impact it had on our family, I hope that others will see that there’s support available, organisations like Survivor Hub, obviously, but also 1800RESPECT. There’s a lot of help out there and reaching out at the most terrible time in your life is a hard thing to do. It is an important thing to know that there’s help available. Zoe Daniels, Susan Templeman and Andrew Wallace form parliamentary eating disorder awareness group There are a bunch of “parliamentary friends” groups in the parliament, which is when politicians from across the political divide come together to learn more and support causes they all have an interest in. Independent MP Zoe Daniel, Labor’s Susan Templeman and the LNP’s Andrew Wallace have come together to form the parliamentary friends of eating disorder awareness. It’s estimated that 2,000 Australians die every year from medical complications arising from eating disorders. Anyone who has had any experience with disordered eating knows it is a lifetime affliction and recovery is not linear. The MPs hope that having an official parliamentary group looking at the disorders will help with advocacy and support for those affected, as well as give stakeholder groups a direct line to parliamentarians. ‘People’s view of me, I think, has changed and softened’: Dutton And finally, Peter Dutton says his mum tells him he needs to smile more (in the context of a question of whether or not he has a negative perception of himself he needs to overcome in the public): Well look, you know, my mum says to me, you know, you should smile more. When you’re in front of a camera, fair point. But if you are the home affairs minister and you’re talking about the levels of sexual abuse against kids, if you’re talking as defence minister, about an evacuation from a particular, you know, village or a particular town or airport, they’re not issues that you can just sort of, you know, crack a joke over. … But I think as leader now, and when you see the polling you refer to, the people’s view of me, I think, has changed and softened just over the last 12 months. And I think that’ll continue because people can see in a more holistic way who you are, your background, you know, the reason given your life experiences, particularly around my time as a police officer. You know, people I think can put into perspective how they see you. And I think even in relation to the voice, I think our position in relation to the voice has been perfectly reasonable, reflective of the views of literally millions of Australians. And I think people can reconsider you when you’re in this role, as no doubt they’ve done with Anthony Albanese when he was infrastructure minister. People had a very different view of him than they do now. … The opportunity in this job is to show the whole product, who you are and what you’ve done in your life and the way that’s influenced you. And I hope that people can reconsider on that basis. Dutton: PM ‘can’t rule out’ any area of policy that would not be affected by Indigenous voice On the Indigenous voice to parliament, Peter Dutton says he supports it in legislation: “There is no question about that.” He says there is still no decision about how the Liberals will answer the question about it being in the constitution (although Dutton has been campaigning on a soft no for months). Dutton again raises his issues with “detail” and Tom Crowley raises that Dutton, as a member of parliament, could actually work out that detail in the parliament. Dutton: Tom, it’s a huge issue because it’s open to the interpretation of the courts and the high court can interpret a form of words in a way that you and I can’t, I mean … Q: But a number of high court justices and former high court justices have made assurances that there’s no particular issue with that wording. What specifically is the concern? Dutton: Well, that there are high court justices who have made the opposite case as well. And this is why people like Frank Brennan who’s an adjunct professor, I think law, and many others … [and] the prime minister himself has said that, you know, the crafting of the words is incredibly important. And a different set of words can deliver a very different outcome than what you thought would be the desired outcome. So … I just think we’ve got to take a step back and look at the question, for example, of when the prime minister says the voice will only be concerned with issues relating to Indigenous Australians. Now, I mean, do you think that that includes health and education? Of course. Does it include law and order and policies around those areas and communities? Of course it does, but it’s actually a racist statement to say that an Indigenous person is impacted differently than a non-Indigenous person in relation to any area of public policy. Defence affects Indigenous people in exactly the same way as it does non-indigenous people, and that’s been ruled out by the prime minister. But he can’t rule that out. So I think there are just questions that are reasonably asked, but do I want to hear from Indigenous Australians about how we can improve the situation? Absolutely. And in East Arnhem Land where I was the other day in Nhulunbuy and Gove, they have a 90% attendance rate of kids at school. They’ve got employment programs, they have a huge housing initiative and many of the problems that we see in other Indigenous communities don’t exist in some of those communities. They’ve got a dialogue which is basically the four clans coming together and almost a government, sort of a small government or a cabinet, I suppose, that’s set up there. Now, in their situation, … they want their voice to be heard and they want their voice to dictate the local policy. ‘There are always global factors’ affecting rate changes: Dutton What would Peter Dutton do to lower the cost of living if he was prime minister? Dutton says: Well, I think if you look at the industrial relations system, everybody wants a system where people are paid fairly, uh, and, and get proper remuneration for their work. But if you’ve got a system which is inflationary, and it’s not just in the area of industrial relations, but some of the … policy decisions that they’re making otherwise, and that they made in the October budget, they’re fuelling inflation. And so the Reserve Bank governor gets all the blame, but he has to deal with the economic settings that are a result of the government’s policies. And at the time when he’s trying to increase interest rates to get above inflation, the government’s driving inflation further. And it’s no mistake that during the Coalition’s time in government in nine years, out of 100 meetings of the Reserve Bank, they increased interest rates on one occasion. Labor’s been in power, they’ve had eight meetings, they’ve increased interest rates eight times, but you go back to the Keating years as well, and compare that to the Howard times, again, much higher interest rates in Labor’s time than now. Tom Crowley asks what specifically he would do, pointing out that there are global factors to what is happening. Dutton says: So you’re right to point out that there are global factors, but there are always global factors. There was the avian bird flu, there was the collapse of Ansett – if you go back over the last 20 or 30 years, there have been different economic circumstances, both domestic and international, that Liberal and Labor governments have had to deal with. But interest rates have always been higher under Labor governments over the last 30 or 40 years. Not just because of the international factors which always exist – the war in the Middle East, the situation in Asia where there was a financial collapse. There have been all sorts of international factors. Peter Dutton asked why Liberal party is so unpopular with younger voters The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has spoken to social news site the Daily Aus (which has also done an interview with Anthony Albanese according to its socials) for its podcast. It’s an … interesting listen. Here are some titbits from Tom Crowley’s in-person chat with the opposition leader. Why is the Coalition so unpopular with younger voters? Dutton says: I think a few things. I think we’ve allowed the Liberal party to be defined by our opponents as opposed to making it very clear as to who we are. I mean, we stand for aspiration. We stand for rewarding effort. And for young people, there’s a particular focus at, you know, a different stage in life maybe than right now on home ownership and how you’re gonna balance a budget once kids come along [or] how you can save money for retirement. I mean, they’re all the things that we believe in, supporting people on that journey and helping them through those different stages of. So I think it’s important for us to recognise what we did on the environment when we were in government. The incentivising of renewables. We’ve got probably the biggest take-up on a per-capita basis of solar anywhere in the world. And that aspiration, I think, is a really important piece to talk about because parents want the best for their children, you want the best for your children, and it’s how we can give people the best start in life. When I left school, I mean, unemployment was very high. There were for-lease signs all over, closed down shops, and it was hard to get work. And we’ve been in a different environment for some time. But hopefully we can demonstrate to people the true value of the Liberal party’s being able to manage the economy well so that you can do well in your own life. And also, I mean, final point, is if the government’s doing well and the economy is being run well, then you can afford to put money into all sorts of projects, social projects, environmental projects that otherwise couldn’t be. Albanese government authorises $9.5m spending for voice civics and awareness The Albanese government has made a legislative instrument authorising $9.5m of spending for a voice civics and awareness campaign. This could be controversial in the context of the Coalition calling for funding of the yes and no campaigns while Labor has held the line on no public funding for the campaigns. The explanatory statement said: The program is needed because all Australians over the age of 18 who are qualified to vote are required to vote in a referendum. Voters should understand the referendum process and what is proposed. The program would focus on delivering facts about the Constitution, referendums as the mechanism to change the Constitution, and information about the Voice proposal. The program would be separate to a campaign run by the Australian Electoral Commission on the mechanics of voting in a referendum. The program could start delivery as early as March 2023. Funding of $9.5 million over two years from 2022-23 would be provided to: - bolstering civics education on the Constitution and referendum process; - improving the impact and reach of the Agency Voice website; - developing a more comprehensive information program on the facts of the Voice proposal and relevant civics information; - paid media placements for the Voice information program to significantly expand reach across the broader community; and - activating the First Nations media sector to boost the delivery of civics education and information on the referendum and Voice proposal in First Nations communities across Australia. Details are still a bit vague. The civics education would be provided by an unspecified a “non-government organisation” but the explanatory statement also notes it will fund an upgrade of the National Indigenous Australians Agency Voice website, including translating it into 30 languages. It said: Separate to the upgrades to the Agency website, funding would be provided to support the development of a more comprehensive information program on the Voice and relevant civics information. This program would focus on the available facts on the Voice. It would not be a ‘yes’ campaign – but would increase understanding of the issues relating to the referendum question. Repeated reference to “the facts” suggests there could be some government-funded factchecking involved. Guardian Australia has asked Indigenous affairs minister, Linda Burney, if this is what it will be used for. Activity test restricting families’ access to early childhood education and care, says Thrive by Five director The Thrive by Five campaign, run by the Forrests’ Minderoo Foundation, has looked in to the activity test (which measures how many hours of paid work a parent does to work out the amount of early childhood education subsidy available) and found that all it does is act as a barrier for parents (mostly mothers) who want to return to the work. (Impact Economics was commissioned to do the analysis) Thrive by Five’s director, Jay Weatherill, says it should be scrapped. Most concerning is that the activity test is forcing more than 126,000 children from low-income households in Australia to miss out on early childhood education and care. This means that a single policy measure is restricting hundreds of thousands of Australian children from accessing the lifelong benefits of high-quality early learning which is simply unacceptable. By continuing to utilise the activity test as a precondition for childcare subsidy allocation, the Australian economy is losing out on more than $4.5bn in GDP contributions from parents who would otherwise be active workforce participants. Instead of incentivising a return to work for parents resulting in more economic activity, as was its original purpose, the activity test has done the exact opposite and has restricted economic participation for far too many. Abolishing the test would increase the workforce participation for about 40,000 women in low income households, the campaign has found. The RBA board will meet tomorrow to make its decision about raising interest rates (which, if it does so, will be the 10th increase in a row). The board has said it won’t hesitate to raise interest rates again and again to get inflation down to its target band (between 2 and 3%), but the data shows whatever savings buffer some people had after the pandemic is diminishing. David Pocock told ABC Breakfast TV it might be time to look at how we deal with inflation: I mean, this is a big question. There’s so many Australians doing it tough. My understanding is that they are simply implementing the rules. I’d like to maybe see some discussion about the rules. If – you know, to reduce inflation, is the best way just to give money to the banks? You know, there’s surely a better way of locking up some of the cash in the economy, whether it’s putting it into super, raising the GST, I don’t know – but to have politicians criticise what seems to be just the process that has been set up by politicians is one thing. What I do know is that there are so many Australians doing it tough and cost of living has to be a focus. We have to find ways to look after people in our communities who need the support. A top of 38C is not uncommon for Australian cities but coming this far into the year (on this side of winter) is a bit unusual for Sydney. The harbour city is in the midst of a low-intensity heatwave (based on comparisons with historic averages and the past 30 days), according to the Bureau of Meteorology. According to Ben Domensino, senior meteorologist with Weatherzone, Sydney has only reached 38C eight times after 5 March in all the years since 1859. On 18 March 2018, the city recorded a 38.0C reading, while 9 March 2004 notched a 39.3C day, Domensino tells us. One issue to keep an eye on will be electricity supply in NSW. The 1260 remaining megawatts of AGL’s Liddell power station in the Hunter Valley will come in handy. (Those remaining three units shut at the end of this month.) The Australian Energy Market Operator has been issuing forecasts of a lack of reserve for NSW, a fairly routine alert to let generators know it has concerns about enough electricity at a certain time. The most recent forecast lack of reserve is still only level 1, with the operator has reserve requirement for NSW of 1,365MW for a period from 5.30pm AEDT to 8pm. So far, the minimum capacity reserve available is 928MW. At this stage, you’d expect the supply gap to be filled. Still, a few politicians will be keeping a wary eye on who things unfold, particularly the premier, Dom Perrottet, who is seeking a fourth term for the Coalition at the 25 March elections. Most Australians support changes to super tax concessions, polling shows Also on the super changes – the latest Newspoll, first published in the Australian, has found that the majority of Australians support it. 64% of those polled approved of Labor’s proposal, with just 29% saying they did not. On the party breakdown, 80% of Labor voters were in favour (no surprise there) but 54% of Coalition voters polled were also in support – despite the Coalition’s stance that this was “an attack on middle Australia” and the Coalition saying it would appeal it if it won the next election. Pocock points out contradiction of stage-three tax cuts versus unchanged jobseeker rate Meanwhile, David Pocock is in support of the super concession changes, although he thinks they could go further. And he also thinks it is time to revisit the stage-three tax cuts – and concessions as a whole. I think they have to be revisited … We get told that raising jobseeker for people who do desperately need that support who are living in poverty, one in six children growing up in poverty at the moment, we’re told, well, we need to be really careful about lifting the rate of jobseeker because that could be inflationary. Yet that $250bn of tax cuts – most of that’s going to the, you know, the wealthier Australians – are somehow exempt from being inflationary, and that, in that conversation, I just don’t get it. You know, if we wanted to deal with bracket creep for people at the low end, there’s better ways of doing that than the stage-three tax cuts. Safeguard mechanism lumping ‘industries of the future’ together with fossil fuel projects: Pocock Chris Bowen could make some changes to the regulations and thereby bypass the Senate with the safeguards mechanism, if it comes to that. What does David Pocock think of that? He could; it would mean that we don’t have these safeguard mechanism credits, which companies and facilities will earn for reducing the emissions on site – they can then trade those with what they’re calling SMCs with other companies. That’s clearly not … a great way to go about it. This is something that we should get right and one of the big concerns with this policy is that we’re lumping together a whole bunch of industries that we desperately need and we know are going to be industries of the future: steel, aluminium, cement. We’re lumping them together with fossil fuels, which we know aren’t the future. And we’re designing it in a way in that those steel, aluminium and cement [producers] are going to have to be competing with potentially new fossil fuel projects, new gas projects that are going to want to offset their emissions. So there’s there’s no acknowledgment of that. And I think, while in principle, this is something that we need. We’ve got to get it right. And so, so far, I think there’s been some really good faith discussions about this, and that’ll obviously continue this week. ‘Some limits’ needed on carbon offsetting, David Pocock says Independent ACT senator David Pocock is one of the votes the government needs for its safeguard legislation. He is still not across the line. He tells Patricia Kavelas: Well, as it as it stands, we will join Kazakhstan as the only two countries in the world that will allow 100% of emissions to be offset using carbon credits. We are allowing heavy industries and things like coal and gas to offset their emissions in the land sector. I think there needs to be some limits on that to ensure that we’re actually incentivising onsite abatement, that people are avoiding emissions rather than just offsetting them and that there are a range of other issues that have been raised. The price cap is also fairly unique in that if we hit the $75 price cap and the government doesn’t hold any more [of] these carbon credit units, then the commonwealth is on the hook for whatever the differences in price between $75 and the price of carbon. I think there’s a lot to get through, having some really good discussions with government. It’s an important piece of policy. I’m not approaching this with red lines. I want to make sure that this policy is as good as it can be and that it will deliver the reductions that we need. Burke: ‘Incredibly important’ for state and federal governments to address deaths in custody in tandem Labor senator Pat Dodson wants the government to urgently implement recommendations from the Deaths in Custody report. Dodson says the government does not need to wait for a voice to act – there is a royal commission report from 1991 which has recommendations which have still not been implemented. And deaths in custody continue to rise. Tony Burke says: Obviously, I’m not the one with carriage of this, but it’s incredibly important [that] anything about custody involves the states. And what Pat Dodson is really calling for is for the federal government to provide leadership in bringing the states with us. One of the things that has to happen nationally is for there to be a national register. We did at the election make a commitment to be able to deliver on the National Register. So that part of it we’re already committed to bringing. The states’ law on this is something that that hasn’t happened. That should have happened and I’m, I’m certainly hopeful that we’re able to get there. And so therefore, it’s a case of the extent of bringing them together. Ultimately, the decision on state laws is still going to rest with them. It’s not something where we can simply force that, but the part of it that we are asked to do with the National Register is something we’ve committed to just on a very key decision that will be made this week. Tony Burke is then asked about this story by Henry Belot: He says: The general principle, I think, that everyone needs to always bear in mind is: even when a government enterprise is functioning on commercial terms, people do have an expectation that ultimately taxpayers own it. More and more people ‘having to work multiple jobs to make ends meet’: Tony Burke Tony Burke, who is the minister in charge of government business, is on ABC radio RN Breakfast. He is asked about the ABS’s latest labour force figures, which showed the number of people with multiple jobs increased by 1.7%. Is he concerned about that? I’ve been concerned about it my whole career. That was one of the issues that I went through in my first speech. And ever since. When I actually worked as an organiser for retail workers, and I discovered that the person who I would have met at a night fill meeting at midnight the night before was then serving me a coffee at 8am, the next morning, in a completely different role. There are always going to be some people who choose multiple jobs, students in particular; there’ll be times where people move in and out of a series of different jobs and have more than one on the go. And that’ll always be the case. Increasingly, though, it’s people who are trying to hold a household together, who are having to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. And some of the problem here is where full-time jobs or part-time jobs are available with regular decent hours and people are only being offered very short shifts and insecure work. If you look at last year, a whole lot of the secure jobs, better pay bill, the focus was on the ‘better pay’ part. The ‘secure jobs’ part of that bill was a critical first step in being able to get a better deal for people to get more hours at their main job, rather than having to juggle two or three all the time to make ends meet. Welcome back to parliament. It’s just a week long sitting this time around – the main game this month will be in another couple of weeks when the parliament sits for a fortnight. The prime minister is heading to India this week and none of the government’s big headline bills are close enough to getting the numbers they need in the Senate, so this is a week of negotiations and ticking some things off the list. Among those things is the referendum legislation for the voice – which is another cog in the referendum machinery. We haven’t held a referendum this century and there are some things about voting which have changed (early polling etc) so this legislation will update all those bits and bobs. Also on the agenda – the paid parental leave amendment bill, which increases the number of weeks of government paid leave to 20 for sole parents. Legislation which will see the scheme increase to 26 weeks by 2026 will be introduced as part of that raft of changes Labor promised at the election (childcare has already passed). Ed Husic’s National Reconstruction Fund is on the agenda (that’s about money for manufacturing and securing supply chains) and Chris Bowen’s safeguards legislation will be in front of the parliament (where negotiations are ongoing) Outside the parliament, former PM Malcolm Turnbull will front the robodebt royal commission, where he will be questioned about what he knew about the scheme while prime minister. The Canberra Guardian team will bring you all you need to know, helped by the entire Guardian brains trust. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day. Ready? Let’s get into it."

                    "bodyText": "Controversial legislation designed to curb strike action fails to meet the UK’s human rights obligations, MPs and peers have warned. The joint committee on human rights has said the government’s proposed anti-strike laws are “not justified and need to be reconsidered”. The committee warns the legislation would clash with requirements under article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which guarantees freedom of association for workers. The strikes (minimum service levels) bill would mandate minimum service levels for critical industries even on strike days, meaning some workers must stay on duty in industries such as health, transport, fire service, border force, nuclear and education. The proposals, which moved rapidly through the Commons and are now in the House of Lords, do not set out what the minimum service levels should be, but hand ministers the power to impose minimums through secondary legislation. The law would apply across England, Scotland and Wales and make it easier to sack striking workers and leave unions at risk of million-pound fines. In the report, MPs and peers call on Rishi Sunak’s government to reconsider the legislation. They say that “without the government providing specific evidence establishing a pressing social need for minimum service requirements in respect of each of the very broad categories of service set out in the bill, compliance with the requirements of article 11 ECHR remains unclear”. The committee said the penalties that would be imposed on trade unions for failing to comply with the bill would be “severe”. “In our view, they may amount to a disproportionate interference with article 11, particularly in circumstances where the strike does not involve essential services and risks to life and limb,” they said. “The government should reconsider whether less severe measures, such as loss of pay or suspension from work for employees who fail to comply with work notices, could be effective.” The committee chair and SNP MP, Joanna Cherry, said the bill needed amending to address some of the “deep flaws”. “Heavy handed sanctions are compounded by vague rules that would leave striking workers and unions in confusion as to whether they had been met or not,” she said. “The sectors included in the bill are also ill-defined, risking overreach into areas only tangentially linked to the maintenance of vital public services. This means the bill, in our view, is likely to be incompatible with human rights law which provides a right to association and with it, protection for strike action.” Unions have been demonstrating outside parliament against the bill, which has also been criticised by civil liberties groups. In January, Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, promised her party would repeal the bill, saying it was one of the most “indefensible and foolish pieces of legislation to come before this House in modern times”. “This cross-party committee is just the latest expert body to conclude the government’s shoddy bill is not just unworkable but likely unlawful,” she said. “It’s time for ministers to go back to the drawing board, not plough on with a dog’s dinner of a policy that will do nothing to resolve disputes and instead risks pouring petrol on the fire. “If it does pass on the back of Tory votes, the next Labour government will repeal it.” The Trades Union Congress general secretary, Paul Nowak, said the “nasty” bill should be “junked immediately”. “MPs, Lords and civil liberties groups are queuing up to condemn this draconian bill,” he said. “These spiteful new laws are an affront to human rights and are a deliberate attempt to restrict the right to strike – a fundamental British liberty. The government is steamrolling through parliament legislation that will give ministers sweeping new powers to sack workers who take action to win better pay and conditions. “The Conservatives are trying to keep people in the dark. But make no mistake – this bill is undemocratic, unworkable and almost certainly illegal. And crucially it will likely poison industrial relations and exacerbate disputes rather than help resolve them.” A government spokesperson said: “The purpose of this legislation is to protect the lives and livelihoods of the public and ensure they can continue to access vital public services. “We note this report and will consider it in full, but the government needs to maintain a reasonable balance between the ability of workers to strike and the rights of the public, who work hard and expect essential services to be there when they need them.”"

The ACT supreme court will today begin hearing disturbing allegations about the treatment of a Ngunnawal woman, Julianne Francis Williams, while on remand in the territory’s only adult prison in early 2021. Williams is expected to tell the court she was forcibly strip-searched despite repeatedly informing guards that she couldn’t breathe and was experiencing pains in her chest. The territory government has kept handheld camera footage of the incident secret. Meanwhile, there has been a groundbreaking new agreement to protect international waters, Liverpool have inflicted an historic defeat on Manchester United, and Toblerone has been forced to change its packaging as the chocolate becomes less Swiss. Australia Prisons | An Indigenous woman will this week allege in court that she was tortured and treated in a “cruel” and “inhuman” way by prison officers who pinned her down, forcibly strip-searched her while holding a knife, and ignored her screamed warnings that she couldn’t breathe and was experiencing chest pains. NSW election | The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has launched a scathing attack on the New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet’s government, saying it is “plagued by scandal” and slamming its “deficit of character”. Housing inequality | Hundreds of participants in a “life-changing” Victorian housing program designed to permanently end rough sleeping face the prospect of returning to homelessness after being served with eviction notices. Weather | Sydney is set to sizzle through its hottest day in more than two years, with temperatures forecast to reach 38C on Monday and authorities warning of increased health and fire risks in parts of NSW.

Full Story What’s in the air in East Palestine, Ohio? On the evening of 3 February, a train more than a mile long made up of 149 carriages came off the rails in the small Ohio town of East Palestine. No one was injured, but the train shed its cargo, which included toxic chemicals. The Guardian’s Nina Lakhani has been reporting from East Palestine and tells Michael Safi local people are furious about the way the accident happened – and how the cleanup has been handled. In-depth For most of the past 200 years, were you to ask an astronomer where the most likely place in the solar system was to find life, the answer would have been Mars – but in the past few decades, astronomers have been increasingly drawn to the deeper, darker realms of the solar system. Next month, the European Space Agency’s Juice probe will launch on a mission to fly closer to Jupiter’s icy moons – including Ganymede, the solar system’s largest – than ever before.

                    "bodyText": "Iran has pledged to restore cameras and other monitoring equipment at its nuclear sites and to allow more inspections at a facility where particles of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade were recently detected, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Saturday. Restoration of the cameras is among assurances reportedly given to the UN nuclear agency that Tehran will finally assist an investigation into uranium particles found at undeclared sites, it said. The breakthrough came as the watchdog’s director general, Rafael Grossi, who earlier met the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, in Tehran, returned to Vienna and said that some of the monitoring activities that were not operating would be restored. A joint statement from the IAEA and Iran said: “Iran expressed its readiness to … provide further information and access to address the outstanding safeguards issues.” The statement did not go into detail on the extent of the assurances but the possibility of improved relations between the UN body and Iran is likely to ward off fresh calls from western countries for Iran to cooperate, diplomats said. Iran has made similar promises before that have yielded little or nothing. The country is supposed to provide access to information, locations and people, Grossi said after returning from Iran before a meeting of the IAEA’s board of governors. Iran would also allow reinstallation of extra monitoring equipment that had been put in place under the 2015 nuclear deal, but was removed last year. The visit to Iran came shortly after the IAEA reported that uranium particles enriched up to 83.7% had been found at an underground nuclear site. Fears are growing that Iran has accelerated enrichment but Grossi said the Iranians had agreed to boost inspections at the facility by 50%. He also confirmed the agency’s findings that there has not been any “production or accumulation” of uranium at the higher enrichment level. Nonproliferation experts say Tehran has no civilian use for uranium enriched to even 60%. A stockpile of material enriched to 90%, the level needed for weapons, could quickly be used to produce an atomic bomb, if Iran chooses. The 2015 nuclear deal with world powers limited Tehran’s uranium stockpile and capped enrichment at 3.67% – enough to fuel a nuclear power plant. It also barred nuclear enrichment at Fordo, which was built deep inside a mountain to withstand attacks from the air. The US unilaterally withdrew from the accord in 2018, reimposing crushing sanctions on Iran, which then began openly breaching the deal’s restrictions. The IAEA has accused Iran of stonewalling its investigation into traces of processed uranium found at three undeclared sites. Its board of governors censured Iran twice last year for failing to fully cooperate."

                    "bodyText": "Australia is set to within a couple of weeks learn some basic details about a program that could cost more than $170bn and will run for decades. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, this week warned against opting for a new UK design. For now though, the Aukus submarine program is a “black box”, says Tom Corben, a foreign policy and defence research fellow at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre. “We’re just speculating until we get the announcement,” he says, adding that the secret has been very well kept, considering the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is set to go to the US to announce it in March. And that speculation is running almost as hot as it was in 2016, when France, Germany and Japan were competing to build a replacement for Australia’s ageing Collins class fleet. France won, then lost in 2021 when the then prime minister, Scott Morrison, scuppered the plan to buy 12 of their conventional Attack class submarines in favour of the Aukus plan for “at least” eight nuclear-powered submarines. The conversation, when it started, was about whether Australia would buy a US or a UK boat. Both of their existing offerings are bigger than the Collins class, and require a bigger crew. Both of their nuclear reactors are designed to last the life of the boat, which can stay submerged until food or the crew’s patience runs out. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But both countries are also already working on their next-generation submarines. The US is currently building 19 Virginia class submarines (known as SSNs, the US classification code for nuclear-powered attack submarines – as opposed to SSBNs, which are nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines). These are more than 140m long and require a crew of 132. They displace (or weigh) more than 10,000 tonnes and carry Tomahawk cruise missiles. From the mid 2030s, the Virginia class will be replaced with the next-generation SSN(X). That “X” means the design hasn’t been finalised yet. The US navy has described it as an “apex predator” that will be faster, stealthier, and bristling with more weapons. The UK’s Astute class also carry Tomahawk cruise missiles, which allow the submarine to hit targets 1,000kms away and send back images of the battlefield. It also has Spearfish torpedos designed to destroy enemy submarines. It has a crew of about 100, is almost 100m long and has displacement of 16,000 tonnes. The UK, too, is thinking about the next generation. The SSN(R), which is still being designed, will replace the Astutes. In times of increasing uncertainty, the Aukus nations are looking for more capability. But the technical specifications are only part of the decision-making process for Australia, which is facing a capability gap as the Collins is set to retire before any new submarines are likely to be available. These are not submarines that can be plucked “off the shelf” from some global supermarket. The newer ones, still in the design phase, are years away from even starting trials. The older ones are desperately needed by their own navies. And the timelines are stretching out into the 2040s, leaving experts worried about how Australia will fill its capability gap. The US industrial base is almost overwhelmed constructing its own submarine fleets and there have been warnings that it could not stretch to helping Australia as well. “The bottom line is that the US is not going to build the subs on its own,” Corben says. That reinforces the idea that the endeavour will be split between the three nations. “I would have expected a US combat system to be part of this new submarine as a baseline assumption,” he says. “The real question is where the primary frame construction takes place. Some of that could conceivably happen in Australia if our shipbuilding capabilities are brought up to speed and capacity.” Increasingly the UK and Australian ministers have been hinting at a trilateral design, director of the Lowy Institute’s international security program, Sam Roggeveen, says. “The open question in my mind is whether that’s some version of the SSN(X) or SSN(R) or is it a new thing altogether,” he says. A totally new design would set off warning lights, he says, pointing to the problems Australia has had with Sea Sprite helicopters, the Collins class and the Attack class. “We’ve been down the road before of buying highly bespoke capabilities for our forces, which no one else has and it’s ended in disaster.” “It’s a price thing … it’s riskier as well because you’re doing something that hasn’t been done before.” Dutton, the former Coalition defence minister, used a series of media conferences and interviews this week to fire a pre-emptive warning shot against going for a new UK design. He said he believed the US Virginia class was the best choice for Australia because it was least risky and could be ready soonest. “I worry that if the government has taken a decision to go for a cheaper design that it will delay the delivery of those submarines,” Dutton said on Wednesday. The Labor government rebuked Dutton for his “irresponsible” public interventions – saying he was basing his views on out-of-date advice – and said it was important that Aukus remain a bipartisan endeavour. Despite airing those misgivings, Dutton promised to support the government’s eventual decision. Submarine analyst and past president of the Submarine Institute of Australia, rear admiral (ret’d) Peter Briggs, says the SSN(R) is the frontrunner. The SSN(X) will be too big, he says. “The bigger it is, the more crew it carries and the more expensive it is to own.” Briggs points to the government’s emphasis on “at least” eight boats. “We’re a two-ocean country and we need six on each coast,” he says. “From six you have two ready to go at any time.” That’s the law of three, he says. At any point you have one out, one getting ready to go out, and one being serviced after having been out. Building 12 boats, he says, would make us an important enough customer that we could influence the design and perhaps restrict its size – the Collins class has a displacement of less than 3,500 tonnes and a crew of about 50. After Albanese announces where the new submarine will come from, some of the more difficult questions will need to be answered – about where the workforce will come from, whether everyone will willingly and easily share their technology, whether a hybrid build risks Australia’s sovereign control and – importantly – when the submarines will actually be ready."

                    "bodyText": "On 14 February, Kevin Roose, the New York Times tech columnist, had a two-hour conversation with Bing, Microsoft’s ChatGPT-enhanced search engine. He emerged from the experience an apparently changed man, because the chatbot had told him, among other things, that it would like to be human, that it harboured destructive desires and was in love with him. The transcript of the conversation, together with Roose’s appearance on the paper’s The Daily podcast, immediately ratcheted up the moral panic already raging about the implications of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 (which apparently underpins Bing) and other “generative AI” tools that are now loose in the world. These are variously seen as chronically untrustworthy artefacts, as examples of technology that is out of control or as precursors of so-called artificial general intelligence (AGI) – ie human-level intelligence – and therefore posing an existential threat to humanity. Accompanying this hysteria is a new gold rush, as venture capitalists and other investors strive to get in on the action. It seems that all that money is burning holes in very deep pockets. Mercifully, this has its comical sides. It suggests, for example, that chatbots and LLMs have replaced crypto and web 3.0 as the next big thing, which in turn confirms that the tech industry collectively has the attention span of a newt. The strangest thing of all, though, is that the pandemonium has been sparked by what one of its leading researchers called “stochastic parrots” – by which she means that LLM-powered chatbots are machines that continuously predict which word is statistically most likely to follow the previous one. And this is not black magic, but a computational process that is well understood and has been clearly described by Prof Murray Shanahan and elegantly dissected by the computer scientist Stephen Wolfram. How can we make sense of all this craziness? A good place to start is to wean people off their incurable desire to interpret machines in anthropocentric ways. Ever since Joe Weizenbaum’s Eliza, humans interacting with chatbots seem to want to humanise the computer. This was absurd with Eliza – which was simply running a script written by its creator – so it’s perhaps understandable that humans now interacting with ChatGPT – which can apparently respond intelligently to human input – should fall into the same trap. But it’s still daft. The persistent rebadging of LLMs as “AI” doesn’t help, either. These machines are certainly artificial, but to regard them as “intelligent” seems to me to require a pretty impoverished conception of intelligence. Some observers, though, such as the philosopher Benjamin Bratton and the computer scientist Blaise Agüera y Arcas are less dismissive. “It is possible,” they concede, “that these kinds of AI are ‘intelligent’ – and even ‘conscious’ in some way – depending on how those terms are defined” but “neither of these terms can be very useful if they are defined in strongly anthropocentric ways”. They argue that we should distinguish sentience from intelligence and consciousness and that “the real lesson for philosophy of AI is that reality has outpaced the available language to parse what is already at hand. A more precise vocabulary is essential.” It is. For the time being, though, we’re stuck with the hysteria. A year is an awfully long time in this industry. Only two years ago, remember, the next big things were going to be crypto/web 3.0 and quantum computing. The former has collapsed under the weight of its own absurdity, while the latter is, like nuclear fusion, still just over the horizon. With chatbots and LLMs, the most likely outcome is that they will eventually be viewed as a significant augmentation of human capabilities (spreadsheets on steroids, as one cynical colleague put it). If that does happen, then the main beneficiaries (as in all previous gold rushes) will be the providers of the picks and shovels, which in this case are the cloud-computing resources needed by LLM technology and owned by huge corporations. Given that, isn’t it interesting that the one thing nobody talks about at the moment is the environmental impact of the vast amount of computing needed to train and operate LLMs? A world that is dependent on them might be good for business but it would certainly be bad for the planet. Maybe that’s what Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the outfit that created ChatGPT, had in mind when he observed that “AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there’ll be great companies”. What I’ve been reading Profiles of pain Social Media Is a Major Cause of the Mental Illness Epidemic in Teen Girls is an impressive survey by the psychologist Jonathan Haidt. Crowd-pleaser What the Poet, Playboy and Prophet of Bubbles Can Still Teach us is a lovely essay by Tim Harford on the madness of crowds, among other things.

                    "bodyText": "China’s military budget is set to increase again, the spokesperson for its rubber-stamping parliament has said, before a week-long political meeting expected to make big changes to China’s system of governance and increase measures to combat international sanctions. The spokesperson for the National People’s Congress, China’s legislative body, addressed the media on the eve of its annual meeting to outline the week’s agenda, including changes to the constitution and the legal sector, and endorsing new appointments to senior roles. Wang Chao said defence budget rises as a proportion of GDP had been moderate and below global averages. Last year’s 1.45tn yuan (£190bn) budget was a rise of 7.1% and followed a rise of 6.8% in 2021 and 6.6% in 2020. Wang did not say by how much the budget would increase, but said it was “appropriate and reasonable” and was needed for China to meet complex security challenges and to “fulfil its responsibilities as a major country”. “The modernisation of China’s military will not pose a threat to any country,” Wang said. “On the contrary, it will only be a positive force for safeguarding regional stability and world peace.” Under Xi Jinping’s leadership, China has continued to significantly expand and overhaul its military. However, information about actual spending compared with budget announcements remains opaque, with the US defence department estimating it could be 1.1 to 2 times higher. China’s military spending is far below that of the US. But it has the world’s largest infantry and biggest navy, and continues to build its stockpile of missiles, warships, submarines and planes including nuclear-capable bombers and stealth fighters. One of the most significant recent shows of force from China occurred in August, when major live fire drills were staged around the main island of Taiwan in retaliation for a visit to Taipei by the then US speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Under the leadership of Xi China’s military has been tasked with readying for potential war, probably over Taiwan, which Xi says is a province of China that must be “reunified”, despite overwhelming opposition from its government and people. Pelosi’s visit was cited on Saturday in the opening address by the chair of the political consultative conference (CPPCC), which holds its annual meeting concurrently with the NPC, at an event known as the “two sessions”. The chair, Wang Yang, who is also a former Chinese vice-premier, praised China’s “fighting spirit” in response to foreign sanctions against the government, and to Pelosi’s visit. The increasingly aggressive posturing and military activity towards Taiwan, as well as crackdowns in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, and support for Russia in its Ukraine invasion, have attracted international criticism and sanctions. At the NPC press conference, Wang Chao decried foreign sanctions against China as “bullying acts” and said China had introduced regulation and laws to counter such efforts, and was working on more."

Brian Welsh’s rhapsody to rave reminds us of that important part of British youth culture we left somewhere in a field in West Lothian. Ellen E Jones My Childhood (1972) Based on director Bill Douglas’s own wartime childhood, this was made in the Scottish mining village of Newcraighall, where PoWs were confined. One shot shows Newcraighall Colliery, known as Klondyke, which closed in the 1960s. Peter Bradshaw Ratcatcher (1999) The great Lynne Ramsay made her first feature with a Scottish reverie, set in the Glasgow of 1973 (and, briefly, on the moon). The result is filled with brilliant, mournful poetry, a boy’s life captured amid creaking tenements and the Forth and Clyde Canal. Danny Leigh Trainspotting (1996) The film’s “choose life” scene in which Mark Renton, played by Ewan McGregor, shoplifts and sprints away down the pavement, takes place on Princes Street in Edinburgh. PB Under the Skin (2013) To watch Jonathan Glazer’s modern classic is to see Glasgow through new eyes. The gaze belongs to a predatory alien played by Scarlett Johansson; we come to share her experience of Trongate, Celtic Park and the unnerving hum of the Buchanan Galleries shopping centre. DL * * * Wales Blue Scar (1949) Documentarist Jill Craigie made this fiction feature about a young woman who moves away from her hometown mining community to London. It is shot partly on locations in Aber/Blaengwynfi in south-west Wales: a (now demolished) colliery, Commercial Street and the Pithead Baths. PB The Proud Valley (1940) The principled Paul Robeson was selective about his movie roles, but lent his Hollywood glamour and beautiful baritone to the south Wales coalminers’ cause in this Ealing Studios drama. The miners reciprocated, pledging support and hosting tribute concerts, even during Robeson’s McCarthy-era blacklisting. EEJ Sleep Furiously (2008) The seasons pass over the rural Welsh community of Trefeurig, but what defines this place all year? Such is the question asked by Gideon Koppel’s deadpan portrait of his childhood home: a world of silent farmland and flashes of sly absurdity. DL Submarine (2010) Oliver is a precocious 15-year-old in Swansea whose lopsided view of love leads to melodramatic moments, with the placid Welsh coastline as a backdrop. Submarine is also the feature-directing debut of Richard Ayoade, AKA “that bloke off the panel shows”. EEJ Twin Town (1997) This raucous comedy crime drama stars Rhys Ifans and his brother Llŷr, and it’s unsentimentally set in Port Talbot and Swansea. With sweeping shots of the seaside, we also see Constitution Hill and Langland Bay beach huts. PB * * * Northern Ireland Boys from County Hell (2020) A crew of construction workers unearth the ancient legend of Abhartach – a blood-sucking revenant and inspiration for Bram Stoker’s Dracula – in this comedy-horror caper set in County Tyrone. Particularly good craic is had by reluctant local hero Francie (Nigel O’Neill). EEJ Elephant (1989) The brutal logic of the Troubles is laid bare by fabled director Alan Clarke. All but wordless, this 39-minute film moves through the parks, factories and sidestreets of Belfast, every scene ending with one anonymous figure gunning down another. DL Good Vibrations (2012) This affectionate comedy about 1970s punk entrepreneur Terri Hooley is set in Belfast, with city locations including Rugby Road near the Botanical Gardens, and the Lanyon Building of Queen’s University. PB Hush-a-Bye Baby (1990) Margo Harkin’s sparkling, Derry-set teenage romance (co-starring Sinéad O’Connor) was twice ahead of its time. The backdrop of the 1983 Irish abortion referendum prefaced the 2018 Repeal the Eighth campaign. Also, Harkin’s quartet of school pals were very much the original Derry Girls. DL Maeve (1981) You can’t go home again, so the story goes. In 1981’s angular and underseen Maeve, that home is Belfast. Returning from London, the titular heroine steps back into a fractured city, all while consumed by childhood memories. DL Odd Man Out (1947) Director Carol Reed made Vienna the setting for one noir masterpiece in The Third Man. With Odd Man Out, he did the same with Belfast, with James Mason playing a wounded republican fugitive on the run. DL * * * England: north-west 24 Hour Party People (2002) Set in Manchester – or Madchester, to be more specific – this proudly postmodern biopic of Factory Records founder Tony Wilson is a night out at the Haçienda in filmic form, and also a high point in the fruitful Steve Coogan-Michael Winterbottom collaboration. EEJ Bhaji on the Beach (1993) A day out at Blackpool’s famous seaside is the occasion for much introspection, confrontation and home-cooked snacks in Gurinder Chadha’s debut. Singalongs to the Punjabi-language cover of Cliff Richard’s Summer Holiday should be included in the British citizenship test. EEJ Control (2007) Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis’s story is told in this tough, yet visually beautiful film from Anton Corbijn, with many superbly realised northern locations, including Ian’s actual house in Barton Street in Macclesfield. PB A Taste of Honey (1961) Every line a quote-in-waiting, the film of Shelagh Delaney’s stage play hinges on teenage renegade Jo – and the backdrop of Salford. But let’s not forget the supporting role played by the tawdry joys of Blackpool’s Central Pier. DL Withnail and I (1987) Much of the most rain-soaked film in British cinema is set in Camden Town. But it would be half the glorious comedy it is without an even wetter Lake District, to which the titular out-of-work actors go on holiday by accident. DL * * * North-east Billy Elliot (2000) Billy Elliot contains some wonderful location work in Durham, which is lovingly evoked: the street with the sea view down which Billy dances is Embleton Street in Dawdon, and the street where Julie Walters’s teacher character drops Billy off after his lesson is just by the old Easington Colliery. PB Get Carter (1971) Like the struggling actors of Withnail and I, Michael Caine’s gangster Jack Carter travels north from London. For him, though, the destination is Newcastle upon Tyne, on the trail of revenge and a beer in a thin glass. DL I, Daniel Blake (2016) Set in Newcastle upon Tyne, Ken Loach’s Palme d’Or winner is Loachian cinema at its most effective. Dave Johns and Hayley Squires give startlingly humane performances that stand out all the more being set against the inhumanity of the benefits system. EEJ Lady Macbeth (2016) Out in the wilds of 19th-century Northumberland, an unhappily married woman may stray from the path of moral righteousness. Florence Pugh shows us just how far, in her breakthrough role as the titular antiheroine. EEJ Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991) The 90s Robin Hood, featuring Alan Rickman as the scene-stealing sheriff, was filmed around England and France but very prominently at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland – notably when the Bishop of Hereford falls from a window of the tower after trying to take a lot of gold with him. PB * * * Yorkshire Ali &amp; Ava (2021) Romance can blossom in the most apparently unromantic of settings. That’s the upshot of Clio Barnard’s intensely heartfelt fourth feature, a beautifully performed, music-fuelled drama set in Bradford, starring Adeel Akhtar and Claire Rushbrook as the unlikely couple. EEJ Billy Liar (1963) We meet the young fantasist Billy Fisher (Tom Courtenay) in an anonymous Yorkshire town, mostly played on screen by Bradford. But the real setting for this dark comedy of imagined self-improvement is the inside of Billy’s head – the stage for his endless daydream heroism. DL God’s Own Country (2017) Britain’s answer to Brokeback Mountain is a sensuous Yorkshire romance starring Josh O’Connor as a young sheep farmer from near Keighley, whose outlook on life and land is transformed by a burgeoning new relationship with a Romanian migrant worker (Alec Secăreanu). EEJ Kes (1969) Ken Loach’s searing and funny film is set south of Barnsley, in the small town of Hoyland in South Yorkshire. Many of its streets have been demolished, but the hillside of Grange View is where Billy reads his Dandy comic and he trains the kestrel itself on Hoyland Common. PB Threads (1984) In which the world ends with a ground-level view of Armageddon, as experienced by Sheffield and its South Yorkshire surrounds. The film remains a late cold war landmark, a nuclear endgame broadcast on BBC One. DL * * * East Midlands The Lair of the White Worm (1988) Hugh Grant and Amanda Donohoe star in Ken Russell’s horror film based on the Bram Stoker novel, and in its opening shot the film features the beautiful but faintly eerie natural limestone cavern called Thor’s Cave in the Derbyshire Peak District, which is here the purported home of the dreaded “Worm”. PB The Last Tree (2019) There’s a soul-stirring visual comparison between the Wash in Lincolnshire and a Lagos beach here, as writer-director Shola Amoo rejects the usual cliches of young Black British male representation in favour of something transcendent and Terrence Malick-esque. EEJ Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960) Two stars were born for the price of one in the seething Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, and both in Nottingham’s Raleigh bicycle factory. The first was Arthur Seaton, the magnetic rebel at the heart of the story – the second Albert Finney, the young actor playing him. DL Skeletons (2010) Nick Whitfield’s Kaufmanesque comedy, about two psychic exorcists roaming around removing people’s painful memories with special equipment, is set in the Midlands – in the village of Bonsall in the Derbyshire Dales. One character lives in a boat beside the looming towers of Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station. PB This Is England (2006) The title’s bold claim is fully justified by Shane Meadows’s film set in an unidentified Midlands town in 1983 about a skinhead youth gang infiltrated by far-right ideology. Seen through the eyes of troubled 12-year-old Shaun, played by Thomas Turgoose, it’s also about much more. EEJ * * * West Midlands Atonement (2007) Joe Wright’s movie, based on Ian McEwan’s novel, is notable for its mysterious and intense scenes at the family home of the Tallis sisters; this is in fact the magnificent Victorian mansion Stokesay Court in south Shropshire, with its prospect over the Clee Hills. PB The Card (1952) The Card is the story of a cheeky young man on the make, who hails from the Potteries. The film uses the town of Burslem on the Fowlea Valley a great deal. In the opening shot, taken from the rooftop of its Dale Hall Pottery, the location is shown in a panorama. PB Felicia’s Journey (1999) This brooding drama starring Bob Hoskins is set in Birmingham, with vivid location work near the city’s Digbeth bus station, the Rotunda and the old Bull Ring Shopping Centre, Electric Avenue by the River Tame and the Windsor Street gas works. PB Handsworth Songs (1986) The 1985 riots that shook Handsworth, Birmingham are a starting point for artist-film-maker John Akomfrah. But Handsworth Songs has a wider lens, too: a dense, dubby bricolage of Windrush, English racism and colonial history. DL Locke (2013) Technically, the location of Locke is the BMW driven for the entire running time by Tom Hardy’s regretful construction foreman. But his journey down the M1 starts in Birmingham, and the story is rooted there, too, on familiar ground for writer-director Steven Knight. DL * * * East of England Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa (2013) Is Norfolk proud of Partridge yet? The bard of modern media mediocrity hasn’t done much for broadcasting, but he did prove himself an action hero in this rarest of treats: a sitcom-to-cinema adaptation that actually manages to stay funny. EEJ Chariots of Fire (1981) This patriotic hit cheated with many of its locations – the “Great Court Run” was actually filmed at Eton, not Trinity College, Cambridge – but the film uses the actual King’s Parade in Cambridge, whose hustle-bustle of students and local people is not so different now. PB Fish Tank (2009) Andrea Arnold’s 2010 best British film Bafta winner is set in that suburban hinterland where London becomes Essex, and a girl becomes a woman. First-time actor Katie Jarvis leads, while then rising star Michael Fassbender demonstrated unsettling charisma in a key supporting role. EEJ The Go-Between (1971) The rich beauty of Norfolk and East Anglia is used to great effect in Joseph Losey’s classic. Brandham Hall, the fictional family home where the young hero spends his summer holidays, is the Elizabethan country house Melton Constable Hall, with its handsome park. PB His House (2020) The best British horror movie in years never spells out where its urban haunting takes place. But a grey Tilbury was the filming location, and you could somehow sense the flavour of the nearby docks in a tale of desperate refugees and pasts that catch up with us. DL * * * South-east After Love (2020) The white cliffs of Dover take on a new significance in Aleem Khan’s intimately cinematic debut about widow Mary Hussain, played by Joanna Scanlan, who discovers her late husband’s secret life, then takes daring steps to infiltrate it. EEJ Brighton Rock (2010) If all seaside towns have an underbelly, Graham Greene’s tale of teenage crime and punishment could only have been set in Brighton: in pubs thronged with day-tripping Londoners, with a sun-kissed beach made out of stones. DL A Field in England (2013) Ben Wheatley takes us all back to our folk horror roots with this English civil war psychedelia set in Surrey. Shot Bbeguilingly in black and white, it is unlike anything you’ve seen and uncannily familiar at the same time. EEJ Last Resort (2000) A Russian immigrant (Dina Korzun) with a romantic soul is trapped in Margate, with no means of making money. Arcade manager Alfie (Paddy Considine) might be her salvation, but film-maker Paweł Pawlikowski is too honest to resort to easy sentiment. EEJ * * * South-west Bait (2019) North Cornwall is shown with icy clarity in Mark Jenkin’s experimental, lo-fi, handheld feature, its surfaces described as having the glittering sheen of Cornish granite. Shooting took place at Gooninnis House in St Agnes and on the West Penwith peninsula. PB Java Head (1934) Los Angeles-born Anna May Wong was considered Hollywood’s first Chinese-American star (a reputation recently burnished by Damien Chazelle’s Babylon), but she also made several British films, including this romantic tragedy set in 1800s Bristol, in which she radiates a mesmerising glamour. EEJ Nuts in May (1976) Ah, the great British camping holiday! Idyllic, isn’t it? That is until someone else pitches their tent too close. Mike Leigh taught us that in this comedy classic set in Dorset, but the likes of Keith and Candice-Marie, played by Roger Sloman and Alison Steadman, will never learn. EEJ The Shout (1978) This disturbing psychological chiller, about a man who claims to practise a lethal “terror shout”, is set in and around the beautiful north Devon coast, with scenes at Hartland Abbey and also shots of Saunton Sands near the River Taw estuary and the sand dunes of Braunton Burrows. PB * * * London Babylon (1980) No discussion of London movies could take place without a mention of Babylon, Franco Rosso’s vivid portrait of sound system culture and Black London life. From a production office above a Deptford church, the movie cast a pinpoint eye across a south London that cinema had previously little noticed. DL My Beautiful Laundrette (1985) Thatcher-era south London is the setting for this still-fresh film about a young British-Pakistani man, played by Gordon Warnecke, running a laundrette with Daniel Day-Lewis as his white punk boyfriend. It’s a representation landmark, but wears that status as lightly as soapsuds. EEJ The Long Good Friday (1980) Did any film map a new era as precisely as The Long Good Friday? In 1980, with London’s Docklands set to become an investors’ playground, Bob Hoskins’ gangster declared himself a businessman and a Londoner. And in London, business would never be the same. DL Notting Hill (1999) Richard Curtis’s revered romcom offers a glimpse behind the doors of the smart, vaguely bohemian, terraces of Notting Hill, west London. Hugh Grant is the lonely, lovable owner of a travel bookshop situated somewhere between Notting Hill Gate and Portobello market. It is through this market that our hero wanders in a lovelorn way, having fallen hopelessly for Julia Roberts’s Hollywood megastar. PB Victim (1961) The seedy, racy nastiness that lay beneath the surface of London’s West End in the early 60s, with its hypocrisy and evasion, is brilliantly captured in this drama of blackmail and homophobia. Dirk Bogarde plays the barrister with a troubled past, while sinister lowlife figures drift around the pubs and drinking dens of Cecil Court and Charing Cross Road. PB"

                    "headline": "Rightwing Republicans rail against US aid for Ukraine: ‘We’ve done enough’",
                    "bodyText": "Marjorie Taylor Greene, an influential far-right Republican in Congress, has called for the US to stop aid to Ukraine, giving added voice to a grassroots revolt in the party that threatens bipartisan support for the war against Russia’s Vladimir Putin. The Georgia congresswoman is a notorious provocateur who has made racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic statements and promoted bizarre conspiracy theories. Yet she has emerged as a prominent voice in the House of Representatives after forging a bond with the speaker, Kevin McCarthy, who vowed that Republicans will not write a “blank cheque” for Ukraine. Greene told the Guardian that Joe Biden is “putting the entire world at risk of world war three”, a view widely held at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), America’s biggest annual gathering of conservatives. “I think the US should be pushing for peace in Ukraine instead of funding and continuing a war that seems to be escalating and putting the entire world at risk of world war three,” Greene said during CPAC at the National Harbor in Maryland on Friday. Greene called for US funding to cease immediately, insisting that, while she voted for a resolution to support the Ukrainian people and condemning Russia’s invasion, “we are actually accelerating a war there”. She added: “We should be promoting peace. Europe should have peace and the United States should do their part. Ukraine is not a Nato member nation and Joe Biden said in the beginning he would not defend Ukraine because they’re not a Nato member nation. It doesn’t make sense and the American people do not support it.” A year after Russia’s unprovoked invasion, the US has provided four rounds of aid to Ukraine, totaling about $113bn, with some of the money going toward replenishment of US military equipment that was sent to the frontlines. The two leading contenders for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, former president Donald Trump and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, have both expressed scepticism about the Ukraine cause. Opinion polls also show an erosion of public support. The conflict was mostly absent from speeches on the main stage at CPAC, once the home of cold warrior Ronald Reagan but now a stronghold for the isolationist “America first” wing of the Republican party. Nikki Haley, a former ambassador to the UN who is running for president, and Mike Pompeo, an ex-secretary of state weighing his own run, gave the subject a wide berth in their addresses. But outside the cavernous ballroom with its glitzy red, white and blue stage, neat rows of seats and banks of TV cameras, there was less circumspection and more crowd congestion. The rightwing podcaster and former White House strategist Steve Bannon repeatedly railed against the war in Ukraine before a noisy gathering of fans. On Friday he was joined by Matt Gaetz, a Florida congressman who recently put forward a “Ukraine Fatigue” resolution in the House. Gaetz warned of the dangers of Russia’s nuclear arsenal and the threat of a third world war and said: “Zelinskiy’s new zeal for anti-corruption efforts and oversight seems to directly align with Republicans taking over the House of Representatives.” Bannon rejoined: “Every Republican who supports this murderous war in Ukraine should be turfed out.” Interviews with more than a dozen CPAC attendees elicited similar views and, in some cases, sympathy for Putin. Theresa McManus, wearing a cowboy hat and jacket, and a riding skirt patterned with words from the US constitution, said forcefully: “I like Putin. I think he’s got balls and he’s taking care of his country.” Repeating a Kremlin talking point that people in the Donbas region want to be liberated from Ukraine, the 67-year-old horse trainer from rural Virginia continued: “No, we shouldn’t give them any more money. No, we should not be involved with them. They should not be part of Nato.” Paul Brintley, 50, ambassador for the North Carolina Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition, described Putin as “not so much a dictator” and said of Ukraine: “I don’t think we should be the police of the world. I don’t think we should bankroll them. We’ve done enough.” Some at CPAC hew to conspiracy theories about the war. Jason Jisa, 41, from Dallas, Texas, said: “Show me where you’re sending the money. Show me war footage. Go look at all the previous wars: Afghanistan, Iraq, we’re flooded. We’re shown video of it every single day. You don’t see hardly any video come from Ukraine. Why? Where are the camera crews?” Jisa, owner of the “USA Trump Store”, added: “Where’s the money going? Why are we on the hook for them? Why, while we have veterans in the street, we have homeless people all over the place, we have inflation going crazy, are we going to send billions and billions and billions of dollars?” Ukraine is emerging as a wedge issue in the looming Republican primary election. Trump, who launched his campaign last November, has repeatedly called for an end to hostilities and claimed that, if he were to return to the Oval Office, he could end the war “within 24 hours”. DeSantis, another potential contender, was viewed as a foreign policy hawk who embraced tough rhetoric against Putin while he served in Congress. But he has increasingly adopted a similar tone as he courts Trump’s populist base, though he did not attend CPAC. But former vice-president Mike Pence, widely expected to launch a bid for the White House in the coming months, has called for Washington to intensify support for Ukraine and insisted that “there can be no room in the leadership of the Republican Party for apologists for Putin”. This stance is shared by the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, and others in the party establishment. Neither Pence nor McConnell came to CPAC, which some critics argue is losing relevance as it fails to shake off Trump. Hylton Phillips-Page, 67, a retired investment manager from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, described Putin as a “thug” but admitted “mixed feelings” over continued aid for Ukraine. “I don’t think our support can forever be at the expense of our own country. I would be quite OK with our Congress saying: until you finish the wall and protect our own border, you shouldn’t be protecting somebody else’s border. I’m not opposed to supporting them but I would like us to do some stuff at home.” Antwon Williams, 40, from Columbia, South Carolina, who was selling Trump merchandise, said: “America needs to worry about the troops that we have, our veterans that need our help here in America, instead of writing an unlimited cheque to these people out here,” he said. “No offence to them [Ukrainians]. It’s horrible what they’re going through. No one wants to see anyone hurting and dying out there. But we have our own veterans that fought for America and our freedom that is hurting, that is homeless, that is needing help, who have mental issues and who are starving right here in America.”"

                    "bodyText": "It is now 11pm in Kyiv. Here is a wrap-up of today’s developments: Officials of the Kharkiv oblast have ordered a partial mandatory evacuation in Kupiansk for families with children and residents with physical with physical disabilities. The evacuation was ordered “in light of the unstable security situation caused by the constant shelling of the community by Russian troops,” the Kyiv Independent reports. US president Joe Biden and German chancellor Olaf Scholz met at the White House on Friday where both leaders praised each other’s country’s support towards Ukraine. “As NATO allies, we’re making the alliance stronger and more capable,” said Biden. Meanwhile, Scholz told Biden that it was important that the US and Germany organized in “lockstep” following the Russian invasion of Ukraine last February. US Attorney general Merrick Garland has made an unannounced trip to Ukraine on Friday, according to Department of Justice officials. Garland had traveled to Lviv, Ukraine following an invitation from the Ukrainian prosecutor general, USA Today reports officials saying. Serbia has denied that it has supplied weapons to Ukraine, its foreign minister said on Friday. Following Russia’s demand on Thursday to know whether Serbia provided thousands of rockets to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, Serbia foreign minister Ivica Dacic said that zero weapons have been exported from the country to any parties involved in the “conflict.” The US has announced a new military aid package of ammunition and other support for Ukraine worth $400m (£333m). The package will be funded using presidential drawdown authority, which authorises the president to transfer articles and services from US stocks without congressional approval during an emergency, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. Russia is deploying the most experienced units of the mercenary Wagner group and the country’s army in an attempt to seize the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, the Ukrainian military has said. The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, was pictured visiting the frontline city today for briefings with local commanders on how to boost defence capacity. The chief of the Russian paramilitary group Wagner has said his fighters have “practically encircled” Bakhmut. Only one road remains under Ukrainian control, Yevgeny Prigozhin added in a video posted online in which he called on the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to abandon the city. His claims could not be verified. The situation in Bakhmut appeared to be extremely precarious amid evidence that Ukraine was preparing extensive new defensive positions, including around the nearby city of Kramatorsk. Video posted online showed the blowing up of a railway bridge over the Bakhmutka River to the east of the city, while other footage purported to show damage to a small road bridge. Ukraine has ordered a mandatory evacuation of families and vulnerable residents from the frontline city of Kupiansk and adjacent northeastern territories. The evacuation order was due to the “unstable security situation” caused by Russia’s constant shelling of the town and its surroundings, it said. Russian troops retreated from key cities in the northeastern Kharkiv region, including Kupiansk, and Ukraine recaptured it last September. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said he is confident that western countries will supply fighter jets to Kyiv, and that he is optimistic that the war will end this year. Reznikov, in an interview with the German newspaper Bild, said Ukraine expects to receive “two to three different types” of fighter jets and that he believed it would be “done through a kind of coalition again”, referring to the “tank coalition” of Leopard 2 tanks from western allies. Foreign ministers of the so-called Quad group denounced Russia’s threat to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war as unacceptable, according to a statement issued after a meeting on Friday. The ministers also said they opposed any unilateral actions to increase tensions in the South China Sea, and expressed concerns about the “militarisation” of disputed territories, in a thinly veiled reference to China. The Quad group comprises India, Australia, Japan and the United States. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said he saw a “small improvement” in diplomacy with Russia after a meeting of G20 foreign ministers in New Delhi. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, remained in the room when western countries criticised Russia – unlike at the last G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in Bali last year, when he stormed out – said Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief. Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, has again issued a denial that Ukraine has mounted any attacks within Russian territory. Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia had been hit by a “terrorist attack” in Bryansk, and vowed to crush what he said was a Ukrainian sabotage group that had fired at civilians. Ukraine accused Russia of staging a false “provocation”. The Kremlin said Friday it would take measures to prevent a repeat of what it described as a border incursion. Switzerland’s defence ministry has said it received a request from its German counterparts to allow Rheinmetall AG to acquire some of Switzerland’s mothballed Leopard 2 battle tanks. A German defence ministry spokesperson said it would not send Switzerland’s Leopard 2 tanks onwards to Ukraine if Bern agreed to send them to Berlin. The US has imposed sanctions on a number of Russian individuals connected to the arbitrary detention of the prominent Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza, who has been jailed in Moscow for nearly a year after speaking out against the war in Ukraine. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as we wrap up the blog for today. Thank you for following along. Officials of the Kharkiv oblast have ordered a partial mandatory evacuation in Kupiansk for families with children and residents with physical with physical disabilities. The evacuation was ordered “in light of the unstable security situation caused by the constant shelling of the community by Russian troops,” the Kyiv Independent reports. “Residents of Kupiansk will be provided with accommodation and food. They will also be provided with humanitarian aid and medical support. Appropriate social services will help in obtaining the status of internally displaced persons, financial support under state programs and assistance from international organizations,” said Kharkiv Oblast governor Oleh Syniehubov. According to he Kyiv Independent, 812 children, as well as 724 people with disabilities are currently registered Kupiansk residents. US president Joe Biden and German chancellor Olaf Scholz met at the White House on Friday where both leaders praised each other’s country’s support towards Ukraine. “You stepped up and provided critical military support and you know, I would argue that beyond your military support, the moral support you gave to Ukrainians has been profound. And you’ve driven historic changes at home — increase in defense spending and diversifying away from Russian energy sources — I know that has not been easy, very difficult for you,” Biden told Scholz, CNN reports. Biden went on to add, “As Nato allies, we’re making the alliance stronger and more capable.” Scholz told Biden that it was important that the US and Germany organized in “lockstep” following the Russian invasion of Ukraine last February. “This is a very, very important year because of the very dangerous threat to peace that comes from Russia invading Ukraine, and it’s really important that we acted together, that we organized in lockstep, and that we made it feasible that we can give the necessary support to Ukraine during all this time,” the German chancellor said. The high-level meeting follows a standoff between the two countries after German officials indicated that they will not provide Ukraine with Leopard tanks unless the US agrees to also provide its M1 Abrams tanks to the war-torn country. US Attorney general Merrick Garland has made an unannounced trip to Ukraine on Friday, according to Department of Justice officials. Garland had traveled to Lviv, Ukraine following an invitation from the Ukrainian prosecutor general, USA Today reports officials saying. “The Attorney General held several meetings and reaffirmed our determination to hold Russia accountable for crimes committed in its unjust and unprovoked invasion against its sovereign neighbor,” justice department officials said, USA Today reports. They added that the meeting was not disclosed due to “security” reasons. Serbia has denied that it has supplied weapons to Ukraine, its foreign minister said on Friday. Following Russia’s demand on Thursday to know whether Serbia provided thousands of rockets to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, Serbia foreign minister Ivica Dacic said that zero weapons have been exported from the country to any parties involved in the “conflict.” Dacic said: “I can say that because my ministry gives the permission for (arms) exports…Serbia does not deliver military equipment to any country that we believe would be problematic in any way.” Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova had expressed “deepest concern” about reports that its Balkan ally has delivered thousands of rockets to Ukraine. “We are following this story,” Zakharova said in a statement posted on the Russian foreign ministry website on Thursday, the Associated Press reports. Zakharova referred to media reports that said that a Serbian state arms factory recently delivered approximately 3,500 for the Grad multiple rocket launchers that were used by both Russian and Ukrainian forces. She added that the possible arming of Ukraine represented a “serious question” for Serbian-Russian relations. It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will hold confidential talks with the US president, Joe Biden, in Washington on Friday about the war in Ukraine amid growing concerns that China may provide weapons to Russia. Biden and Scholz will meet for an hour at the White House, including a significant “one-on-one component,” a senior US official said, giving the two men a chance to “exchange notes” on their respective recent meetings with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the state of the war. The US has announced a new military aid package of ammunition and other support for Ukraine worth $400m (£333m). The package will be funded using presidential drawdown authority, which authorises the president to transfer articles and services from US stocks without congressional approval during an emergency, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said.

The situation in Bakhmut appeared to be extremely precarious amid evidence that Ukraine was preparing extensive new defensive positions, including around the nearby city of Kramatorsk. Video posted online showed the blowing up of a railway bridge over the Bakhmutka River to the east of the city, while other footage purported to show damage to a small road bridge. Ukraine has ordered a mandatory evacuation of families and vulnerable residents from the frontline city of Kupiansk and adjacent northeastern territories. The evacuation order was due to the “unstable security situation” caused by Russia’s constant shelling of the town and its surroundings, it said. Russian troops retreated from key cities in the northeastern Kharkiv region, including Kupiansk, and Ukraine recaptured it last September. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said he is confident that western countries will supply fighter jets to Kyiv, and that he is optimistic that the war will end this year. Reznikov, in an interview with the German newspaper Bild, said Ukraine expects to receive “two to three different types” of fighter jets and that he believed it would be “done through a kind of coalition again”, referring to the “tank coalition” of Leopard 2 tanks from western allies. Foreign ministers of the so-called Quad group denounced Russia’s threat to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war as unacceptable, according to a statement issued after a meeting on Friday. The ministers also said they opposed any unilateral actions to increase tensions in the South China Sea, and expressed concerns about the “militarisation” of disputed territories, in a thinly veiled reference to China. The Quad group comprises India, Australia, Japan and the United States. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said he saw a “small improvement” in diplomacy with Russia after a meeting of G20 foreign ministers in New Delhi. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, remained in the room when western countries criticised Russia – unlike at the last G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in Bali last year, when he stormed out – said Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief. Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, has again issued a denial that Ukraine has mounted any attacks within Russian territory. Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia had been hit by a “terrorist attack” in Bryansk, and vowed to crush what he said was a Ukrainian sabotage group that had fired at civilians. Ukraine accused Russia of staging a false “provocation”. The Kremlin said Friday it would take measures to prevent a repeat of what it described as a border incursion. Switzerland’s defence ministry has said it received a request from its German counterparts to allow Rheinmetall AG to acquire some of Switzerland’s mothballed Leopard 2 battle tanks. A German defence ministry spokesperson said it would not send Switzerland’s Leopard 2 tanks onwards to Ukraine if Bern agreed to send them to Berlin. The US has imposed sanctions on a number of Russian individuals connected to the arbitrary detention of the prominent Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza, who has been jailed in Moscow for nearly a year after speaking out against the war in Ukraine. The US president, Joe Biden, is expected to meet Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, shortly for confidential talks in Washington. The war in Ukraine will be at the “forefront” of the meeting between the two leaders, the White House has said. Biden and Scholz will meet for an hour at the White House, including a significant “one-on-one component,” a senior US official said, giving the two men a chance to “exchange notes” on their respective recent meetings with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the state of the war. Joe Biden is due to meet the German chancellor as part of continuing efforts to keep the US and Europe aligned in their defence of Ukraine. It will be a working visit to the White House for Olaf Scholz, stripped of any pomp or protocol. No press conference has been planned for the meeting on Friday afternoon and the chancellor will reportedly not be bringing press with him. A senior administration official predicted it would be short but intense. “We’re expecting it to be a one-hour meeting or so,” the official said, adding that the “bulk of the meeting” would be about Ukraine. There will likely be a significant one-on-one component, which I think is a reflection of the close relationship between the two leaders and the opportunity for the two of them to be able to have in-depth and face-to-face conversations. Part of the US president’s message will be gratitude for Scholz’s agreement to allow the delivery of German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine, though in a recent interview the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, made clear that the White House had to agree to ship US Abrams tanks too in order to convince Scholz to act, a characterisation that Berlin disputes. Washington has also voiced admiration for how quickly Germany has reduced its dependence on Russian gas. Before the meeting, the US is to signal it will continue to play its part in backing Ukraine, announcing a new package of military aid, including mobile bridges mounted on armoured vehicles that would be critical to any Ukrainian counteroffensive, as well as more Himars, multiple rocket launchers. Biden will be looking for continuing parallel commitments from Germany and Europe in what is likely to be a pivotal few months in the conflict. “Without question, they’re going to talk about the kinds of capabilities that Ukraine continues to need in the weeks and months ahead,” said the US national security council spokesperson, John Kirby. Read the full story here: The US has announced a new military aid package of ammunition and other support for Ukraine worth $400m (£333m). In a statement, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said: This military assistance package includes more ammunition for US-provided Himars and howitzers, which Ukraine is using so effectively to defend itself, as well as ammunition for Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, armored vehicle launched bridges, demolitions munitions and equipment, and other maintenance, training and support. The package will be funded using presidential drawdown authority, which authorises the president to transfer articles and services from US stocks without congressional approval during an emergency, Blinken said. The statement continued: Russia alone could end its war today. Until Russia does so, for as long as it takes, we will stand united with Ukraine and strengthen its military on the battlefield so that Ukraine will be in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table. Russia is deploying the most experienced units of the mercenary Wagner group and the country’s army in an attempt to seize the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, the Ukrainian military has said. The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, was pictured visiting the frontline city today for briefings with local commanders on how to boost defence capacity. The post said: The Russian occupiers have sent the most trained units of the Wagner group and other regular units of the Russian army to capture the city. Intense fighting is taking place in and around the city. It continued: In Bakhmut, the commander listened to the reports of the commanders on the situation in their subordinate units, and was informed about the problematic issues of improving the defence capability of our units on the frontline. Russia was “not giving up its hope of capturing Bakhmut and continues to build up forces to occupy the city,” the press service said. The US has imposed sanctions on a number of Russian individuals connected to the arbitrary detention of the prominent Kremlin critic, Vladimir Kara-Murza, who has been jailed in Moscow for nearly a year after speaking out against the war in Ukraine. Kara-Murza was arrested in April and declared a “foreign agent”, and is currently being held on suspicion of spreading false information about the armed forces. He faces more than 30 years in prison. The sanctions target Elena Lenskaya, a Moscow judge; Andrei Zadachin, a special investigator; Danila Mikheev, an expert witness for the Russian government on the case against Kara-Murza; Russia’s deputy justice minister Oleg Sviridenko and two judges, Diana Mishchenko and Ilya Kozlov. In a statement, the US secretary of state Antony Blinken said: The United States reiterates its call for Kara-Murza’s immediate and unconditional release, and is committed to ensuring that Vladimir Putin’s attempts to silence critics will not succeed. Kara-Murza, who holds both British and Russian citizenship, was a close aide to Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was shot dead in central Moscow in 2015. He twice fell suddenly ill, in 2015 and 2017, in what he said were poisonings by the Russian security services, on both occasions falling into a coma before eventually recovering. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Ukraine. Ukrainian parents in areas that were occupied by Russian forces say they were forced to register their newborn babies as Russian citizens, according to a report. Residents living in towns and cities in Ukraine’s east and south faced pressure to accept Russian citizenship for their newborns, including being denied free distribution of diapers and baby food, Reuters reports. Natalia Lukina, 42 from the southern city of Kherson, said: We told (Russians) that the baby was born in Ukraine and is Ukrainian, not Russian. She added: When we asked for diapers, the Russians told us, ‘If you come without Russian birth certificates, we will not give you diapers’. Most parents of small children, with little income during the war, accepted free diapers from Russians, her partner Oleksii Markelov said. “There wasn’t a penny of money.” Reuters could not independently corroborate their account. Many parents delayed visiting Russian-controlled registry offices during the occupation, and many registered their babies for Ukrainian citizenship once the occupation ended, according to Olena Klimenko, head of Kherson’s regional registration office. It is unclear how many babies received Russian citizenship, because Russian officials recorded them and Ukrainian registration workers did not cooperate with them, Klimenko said. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The chief of the Russian paramilitary group Wagner has said his fighters have “practically encircled” Bakhmut, the eastern Ukraine city the Kremlin has been trying to seize for months. Only one road remains under Ukrainian control, Yevgeny Prigozhin added in a video posted online in which he called on the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to abandon the city. His claims could not be verified. The situation in the embattled city of Bakhmut appeared to be extremely precarious, amid evidence Ukraine was preparing extensive new defensive positions, including around the nearby city of Kramatorsk. Video posted online showed the blowing up of a railway bridge over the Bakhmutka River to the east of the city, while other footage purported to show damage to a small road bridge.

The US will announce a new military aid package for Ukraine on Friday, worth roughly $400m and comprised mainly of ammunition, two officials and a person familiar with the package have told Reuters. Good afternoon from London. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest from Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Germany is taking more of a leadership role in organising arms deliveries to Ukraine and has stopped making “excuses” to avoid sending weapons, Ukraine’s ambassador to Berlin, Oleksii Makeiev, has said. Makeiev, in an interview with Reuters, said: What has changed in the last few months is we are not just discussing the current order of the day but we are strategically planning according to what is needed and what can be delivered. There are no more excuses now but facts that we talk about. His remarks were in stark contrast to those by his predecessor, Andriy Melnyk, who regularly chastised Berlin for not doing enough to help Ukraine against Russia’s aggression. Makeiev said the military items Ukraine needed the most were air defence systems, battle tanks, artillery and ammunition to “destroy Russian supply chains”. Kyiv was not currently pushing Berlin to send fighter jets, he said, even if it was discussing possible deliveries of jets with other allies. He said: We discuss what we need with allies in a very precise and content-rich manner. Until this moment, I have not received from our defence ministry any request for a certain type of plane available in Germany. Ukraine is managing to generate as much power as it needs despite heavy damage caused by Russian attacks on its energy network, prime minister Denys Shmyhal said on Friday. Shmyhal told a news conference that just over a year after Russia’s invasion, between 40% and 50% of Ukraine’s energy system had been damaged during waves of missile and drone strikes during the winter. Though millions of people have at times been left without power, Ukraine has quickly carried out repairs, partly with the help of equipment provided by its allies. “Ukraine is for now provided with generating and network capacities,” Shmyhal said. “The next step is to secure the network infrastructure for the next season.” The measures will include constructing concrete and underground shelters to protect power-generating facilities and distribution networks from potential attacks, Reuters reports he said. The Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti is carrying some video footage from the site of a plane crash near Yenakiieve in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic in the occupied east of Ukraine. RIA reports the local mayor, Roman Khramenkov, said the pilots ejected and no one was injured on the ground. Citing Khramenkov, Tass reports that “the aircraft is unambiguously military, but it is still impossible to say who it belongs to” and that the location of the pilots is “currently problematic to establish”. Unverified video posted to social media appears to show a fighter plane on fire as it falls out of the sky. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that its correspondents have heard explosions in Kherson. Russia’s foreign ministry press spokesperson Maria Zakharova has accused the US administration of mischaracterising aspects of the brief conversation between US secretary of state Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart in India yesterday. In a post to Telegram, she wrote: Oh, how interesting. I checked with Sergei Viktorovich [Lavrov] whether Blinken raised the topic of [Paul] Whelan yesterday. It turned out that the US secretary of state did not even stutter about this. Everything that the state department said yesterday about Blinken expressing concern about the situation around the US citizen is a lie. Incredible behaviour of the American administration. Two men have been arrested in the US state of Kansas on suspicion of illegally exporting “sophisticated” aviation-related technology to Russia, the US department of justice has said. Cyril Gregory Buyanovsky, 59, and Douglas Robertson, 55, are charged with conspiracy, exporting controlled goods without a licence, falsifying and failing to file electronic export information and smuggling goods violating US law. The pair, who owned and operated KanRus Trading Co, conspired to skirt US export laws to sell sophisticated aviation equipment to Russia, the US justice department said. The US has drastically ramped up sanctions and financial penalties on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, spoke to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, today in a call where the pair discussed Blinken’s “brief” conversation with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in New Dehli yesterday, US state department spokesperson Ned Price has said. Blinken emphasised to Kuleba the US’ “enduring support for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s brutal attacks\", Price added. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said he is “confident” that western countries will supply fighter jets to Kyiv and that he is “optimistic” that the war will end this year. Reznikov, in an interview with the German newspaper Bild, said Ukraine expects to receive “two to three different types of fighter jets which he said would “depend on the engineers, air fields, maintenance and spare parts”. He said he believed it would be “done through a kind of coalition again”, referring to the “tank coalition” of Leopard 2 tanks from western allies. Asked about the German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s pledges to support Ukraine, he said Kyiv “must receive real security guarantees”. He said: I am an optimist, I see the situation on the battlefield, I see the development of support and I really see that there is a chance to end this war this year with our victory. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked Latvia’s president, Egils Levits, for his country’s defence and political support as the pair met in a “meaningful and symbolic” visit to Ukraine. Zelenskiy and his wife, Olena Zelenska, were pictured earlier today with Levits and his wife, Andra Levite, in Lviv honouring the memory of Ukrainian soldiers fallen during the war. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree enabling the Russian state to suspend the directors and shareholders of any companies that fail to meet state defence contracts under conditions of martial law. The new decree would apply to companies that “violate their obligations under a state contract, including failing to take measures to guarantee production deliveries”, Reuters reports. The decree would allow the industry ministry to name a new external administrator to take over the running of such companies. Asked earlier today if martial law could be introduced in certain regions of Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that was the president’s prerogative, but did not say whether Putin planned such a move. Ukrainian forces have blown up a railway bridge inside the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, according to a report. Video of the controlled explosion, posted on social media and geolocated by CNN, was shared widely today along with unconfirmed reports that it was a sign that Ukraine was preparing to withdraw from the city. Ukraine’s 46th Brigade, which is operating in the city, denied the reports, saying the bridge was already unusable. The unit said: The bridge that is now being shown as proof that we are leaving was blown up a long time ago. Those who are in Bakhmut know that. Now it was just a control shot. Don’t spread panic. And yes, one can cross the river there without a bridge. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said he saw a “small improvement” in diplomacy with Russia after a meeting of foreign ministers from the Group of Twenty (G20) major industrialised countries in New Dehli. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, remained in the room when western countries criticised Russia – unlike at the last G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in Bali last year, when he stormed out – said Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, today. Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue, a forum in New Delhi, Borrell said: At least this time he stayed and he listened. This is a small improvement but it’s important. I think it’s better than nothing. Borrell said he would oppose any effort to boot Russia from the G20 because “we have to keep ways of talking, or at least listening if not talking”. Lavrov and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, spoke briefly on the margins of the G20 meeting on Thursday, in what was believed to be the pair’s first one-on-one conversation in person since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine has ordered a mandatory evacuation of families and vulnerable residents from Kupiansk and adjacent northeastern territories, amid fears that Russian forces will retake the frontline eastern city and rail hub. Russian troops retreated from key cities in the northeastern Kharkiv region, including Kupiansk, and Ukraine recaptured it last September. The Kharkiv regional military administration said in a statement posted on its website on Thursday evening: Mandatory evacuation of families with children and residents with limited mobility began in Kupiansk community. The evacuation order was due to the “unstable security situation” caused by Russia’s “constant” shelling of the town and its surroundings, it said. Those evacuated would be provided with assistance, including accommodation, food, humanitarian aid and medical support, it added. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Ukraine. Germany will not send Switzerland’s mothballed Leopard 2 battle tanks onwards to Ukraine if Bern agrees to send them to Berlin, a German defence ministry spokesperson has said. Asked at a regular news conference how Berlin could guarantee this, the German spokesperson said: There are existing and assessed contractual regulations. Switzerland’s defence ministry earlier confirmed it had received a request from its German counterparts to allow Rheinmetall AG to acquire some of Switzerland’s mothballed Leopard 2 tanks. The request said the tanks would not be sent to Ukraine but be used to backfill gaps created by the handover of Leopard 2s by Germany and Nato and EU allies, according to a ministry spokesperson. Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group, has called on President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to order a withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut. Bakhmut is “practically surrounded” by Wagner fighters with only one route left for Ukrainian forces, Prigozhin said in a video published today. Prigozhin, wearing a military uniform in a video posted on his social media channels, said: Units of the private military company Wagner have practically surrounded Bakhmut. Only one road is left (open to Ukrainian forces) The pincers are getting tighter. Prigozhin’s claims have not been independently verified. The video has been geolocated to the village of Paraskoviivka, 4.3 miles north of the centre of Bakhmut, Reuters reports. Prigozhin announced the capture of Paraskoviivka on 17 February. The video then showed what looked like three captured Ukrainians – an older man and two young boys – who asked to be allowed to go home. They looked to be speaking under extreme stress. Prigozhin added: The [Ukrainian soldiers] are fighting, but their lives near Bakhmut are short – a day or two. Give them a chance to leave the city. The city is in fact surrounded. The Wagner boss published another video yesterday claiming to show his fighters inside Bakhmut. The footage was geolocated to the east of Bakhmut, about 1.2 miles from the city centre. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner group, has published a video that he said showed his fighters in the key eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. In a post on Telegram, uniformed men are seen lifting a Wagner banner on top of a heavily damaged building. The video has been geolocated to the east of Bakhmut, about 1.2 miles from the city centre, where Wagner fighters have been for a while. Foreign ministers of the so-called Quad group denounced Russia’s threat to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war as unacceptable, according to a statement issued after a meeting on Friday.

Ten people are considered missing and five people are now known to have died after a missile hit a residential building in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Thursday morning. Volodymyr Litvinov, head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson, has reported that a tractor driver has been killed by Russian shelling in the area. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian proxy who operates in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region has claimed on Telegram that Ukrainian forces are shelling Enerhodar, the city which stands next to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is also reporting military action at the ZNPP, stating “Employees of the security agencies of the Russian Federation came under aimed fire on the line of contact when meeting International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors who were rotating at the ZNPP.” Belarus has sentenced the Nobel peace prize-winning dissident Ales Bialiatski to 10 years in prison as part of Alexander Lukashenko’s purge of opponents after the 2020 pro-democracy protests against his rule. Bialiatski, a pro-democracy activist, is the founder of Viasna, the authoritarian country’s most prominent human rights group. He was detained in July last year and charged with smuggling cash into Belarus to fund his group’s activities, but is widely recognised as being persecuted for his opposition to Lukashenko. Bialiatski was awarded the Nobel peace prize alongside the Russian human rights organisation Memorial, and the Ukrainian human rights organisation Center for Civil Liberties, in October. Joe Biden, the US president, and Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, will focus their discussions in Washington on Friday on war aid for Ukraine and may also touch on concerns that China may provide lethal aid to Russia, a senior US administration official has said. The US will announce a new military aid package for Ukraine on Friday, worth roughly $400m and comprised mainly of ammunition, two officials and a person familiar with the package have told Reuters. Switzerland’s defence ministry on Friday said it had received a request from its German counterparts to allow Rheinmetall AG to acquire some of Switzerland’s mothballed Leopard 2 tanks. The request said the tanks would not be sent to Ukraine, but would be used to backfill gaps created by the handover of Leopard 2s by Germany and Nato and EU allies. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday that Russia “will not let the west blow up gas pipelines again” and said that Moscow would no longer rely on the west as an energy partner. Mikhail Abdalkin, a member of the Samara regional Duma, has been charged with “discrediting the Russian armed forces” and will go on trial on 7 March. Abdalkin posted a photograph of himself on Telegram on 21 February listening to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s state address with what appeared to be noodles draped over his ears. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Belarus has sentenced the Nobel peace prize-winning dissident Ales Bialiatski to 10 years in prison as part of Alexander Lukashenko’s purge of opponents after the 2020 pro-democracy protests against his rule. Bialiatski, a pro-democracy activist, is the founder of Viasna, the authoritarian country’s most prominent human rights group. He was detained in July last year and charged with smuggling cash into Belarus to fund his group’s activities, but is widely recognised as being persecuted for his opposition to Lukashenko. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the country’s opposition leader in exile, wrote on Twitter: “The sentencing of Viasna human rights defenders today – including Nobel peace prize laureate Ales Bialiatski – is simply appalling. Ales has dedicated his life to fighting against tyranny. He is a true hero of Belarus and will be honoured long after the dictator is forgotten.” Bialiatski was sentenced alongside three other Viasna activists, the group said in a statement on Friday. Bialiatski was awarded the Nobel peace prize alongside the Russian human rights organisation Memorial, and the Ukrainian human rights organisation Center for Civil Liberties, in October. Volodymyr Litvinov, head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson, has reported on his Telegram channel that a tractor driver has been killed by Russian shelling in the area. He posted: Russians fired at a tractor driver near the village of Tomaryne in the Beryslav territorial community. The 33-year-old victim was taken to the nearest medical facility by the military. However, the doctors could not do anything but declare his death. The injuries received due to the Russian shelling turned out to be too severe. At the same time, Vladimir Rogov, a Russian proxy who operates in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region, has claimed on Telegram that Ukrainian forces are shelling Enerhodar, the city which stands next to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). He posted to Telegram to say: Explosions are heard in the city. According to preliminary information, Ukrainian forces fired Nato-style heavy artillery. The sounds of arrivals (at least seven) were most loudly heard by the citizens in the area of the industrial zone, located not far from the ZNPP. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is also reporting military action at the ZNPP, stating “Employees of the security agencies of the Russian Federation came under aimed fire on the line of contact when meeting International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors who were rotating at the ZNPP.” None of the claims have been independently verified. Tass reports that a military adviser to the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) – an occupied area of Ukraine that the Russian Federation claims to have annexed – has told the news agency that the DPR intends to strengthen checkpoints along the line of contact as a result of yesterday’s incident in Bryansk. Tass reports that according to official figures, two people died and a 10-year-old boy was injured during. Additionally, Reuters reports that the Kremlin said this morning it would take measures to prevent a repeat of what it described as a border incursion by Ukraine-backed nationalists. It did not specify the additional measures. President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday Russia had been hit by a “terrorist attack”, and vowed to crush what he said was a Ukrainian sabotage group that had fired at civilians. Ukraine accused Russia of staging a false “provocation”. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the office of the president of Ukraine, has again issued a denial that Ukraine has mounted any attacks within Russian territory. Explosions at critical facilities; unidentified drones attacking Russian Federation’s regions; clashes of gangs; partisans attacking populated areas – all these are direct consequences of the loss of control inside Russian Federation. And consequences of war. Ukraine is not involved in internal conflicts in the Russian Federation. Yesterday Russia accused Ukrainian forces of mounting an incursion within its borders which the Kremlin described as terrorism, and earlier this week it dismissed Podolyak’s denial that Ukraine had launched drones against targets within Russia. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Ukraine. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports on its Telegram channel on the situation in Donetsk. It writes: On 2 March, Russian troops carried out 45 strikes on 17 settlements in Donetsk region. They hit Bakhmut nine times with artillery, 18 high-rise buildings and one private house were destroyed and damaged, and there were wounded. Earlier, Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, said in a video that Bakhmut was “practically surrounded” None of the claims have been independently verified. The air alert that has been in effect across Ukraine is ending. Reuters reports that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, said in a video published on Friday that the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut was “practically surrounded” by Russian forces and that Kyiv’s forces had access to only one road out. Prigozhin in the video called on Volodymr Zelenskiy to withdraw his forces from the city, which Russia has been trying to capture without success for months. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, offers this summary of news from the past 24 hours on its official Telegram channel: In Zaporizhzhia, the rubble of a five-story building, which was hit by a Russian rocket the previous night, continues to be dismantled. The number of dead has increased to five, 10 people are considered missing. In the last day, Russian troops fired more than 360 projectiles in the Kherson region: residential buildings were damaged, one person died, 17 were injured. In Donbas, the Russian army continues to fire on populated areas along the entire frontline. On 2 March, as a result of shelling in the Donetsk region, two people were killed and five were injured. The claims have not been independently verified. Switzerland’s defence ministry on Friday said it had received a request from its German counterparts to allow Rheinmetall AG to acquire some of Switzerland’s mothballed Leopard 2 tanks. The request said the tanks would not be sent to Ukraine, but would be used to backfill gaps created by the handover of Leopard 2s by Germany and Nato and EU allies, a ministry spokesperson told Reuters. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday that Russia “will not let the west blow up gas pipelines again” and said that Moscow would no longer rely on the west as an energy partner. Reuters reports Lavrov was speaking at an event in India a day after attending a meeting of G20 foreign ministers. Russia has claimed that western forces were behind the undersea explosions at the Nord Stream gas pipes last September, and has repeatedly insisted it should be included in any investigations of the incident. The Russian state-owned RIA Novosti news agency reports on its Telegram channel that Mikhail Abdalkin, a member of the Samara regional Duma, has been charged with “discrediting the Russian armed forces” and will go on trial on 7 March. Abdalkin posted a photograph of himself on Telegram on 21 February listening to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s state address with what appeared to be noodles draped over his ears. He has already been publicly censured by the regional Duma. In the last few minutes air alerts have been declared again across much of Ukraine. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Iryna Viktorivna is serving up free hot food to her neighbours from a trestle table set up in a snowy street in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kupiansk, ladling porridge and meatballs and cabbage salad. The sound of artillery bounces across the shallow bowl in which the city stands, four or five shells a minute – sometimes more – fired by both Ukrainian and Russian gun crews. Mostly the shells land far away, but sometimes they fall on the city. A little earlier, one killed a 63-year-old man and damaged a nursery and fire station. In the queue waiting to be served is 60-year-old Natalia Ivanivna, wrapped up in a winter coat and scarf and carrying a stick. Ivanivna says she could have been relocated earlier that day but has chosen to stay because she worries about her house being looted. She tells of her concern about the cities further to the south along the eastern front, Bakhmut and Vuhledar and others, that have already been reduced to rubble over months of fighting. “It could happen here,” she says. Viktorivna interrupts to chide her: “Don’t be pessimistic!” As both women know, the tides of war have twice washed over Kupiansk already. Now it is threatened by a third inundation: The Group of 20 is no longer an economic forum and has become a platform to discuss geopolitical issues, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Friday, according to Reuters. His comments were prompted by the Russia-Ukraine war dominating two recent meetings of G20 foreign and finance ministers in India, the current president of the bloc. Neither Washington nor Berlin says they have seen evidence of Beijing’s providing weapons to Moscow, but US officials say they are monitoring the situation closely. Germany, which has typically taken a much less hawkish stance on China, its top trading partner, than the United States, has suggested China could play a role in bringing about peace – a prospect many China observers view with skepticism. A second senior US official downplayed suggestions of big strains between Washington and Berlin. “The relationship is in a rock-solid place,” the official said. “Tomorrow’s meeting will largely focus on what we are doing together next to support Ukraine – a sign of the good footing the relationship continues to be on.” A major topic of today’s meeting between Scholz and Biden will be the push to deliver fresh western support to Ukrainian forces, which are bracing for new Russian offensive in coming weeks, officials said. Washington is due to announce a new $400m military aid package for the Kyiv government on the day of Scholz’s visit, officials said. His first trip to Washington since just before the invasion comes days after Biden’s security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told ABC that Biden overrode his military’s advice and agreed to send Abrams tanks to Ukraine because Scholz made it a pre-condition for sending German Leopards. Berlin says Biden came to see it was necessary and the decision was consensual. The German leader arrives as United States is sounding out close allies about the possibility of imposing sanctions on China if Beijing provides military support to Russia for its war in Ukraine, according to four US officials and other sources. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will hold confidential talks on Friday in Washington with the US president, Joe Biden, about the war in Ukraine amid growing concerns that China may provide weapons to Russia. Scholz set off on the one-day trip, which unusually will not include a press delegation, late on Thursday. Biden and Scholz will meet for an hour at the White House, including a significant “one-on-one component,” a senior US official said, giving the two men a chance to “exchange notes” on their respective recent meetings with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the state of the war. “Both of the leaders wanted this to be a working-level meeting, wanted it to be very much a get down into the weeds, focused on the issues of Ukraine,” the official said. Foreign ministers of the so-called Quad group denounced Russia’s threat to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war as unacceptable, according to a statement issued after a meeting on Friday. The ministers also said they opposed any unilateral actions to increase tensions in the South China Sea, and expressed concerns about the “militarisation” of disputed territories, in a thinly veiled reference to China. The Quad group includes India, Australia, Japan and the United States. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next few hours. Our top stories this morning: foreign ministers of the so-called Quad group denounced Russia’s threat to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war as unacceptable, according to a statement issued after a meeting on Friday. And German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will hold confidential talks on Friday in Washington with US President Joe Biden about the war in Ukraine amid growing concerns that China may provide weapons to Russia as its invasion of Ukraine grinds into a second year. More on these stories soon. Here are the other key recent developments: Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner group, has published a video that he said showed his fighters in the key eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. In a post on Telegram, uniformed men are seen lifting a Wagner banner on top of a heavily damaged building. The video has been geolocated to the east of Bakhmut, about 1.2 miles from the city centre, where Wagner fighters have been for a while. Joe Biden, the US president, and Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, will focus their discussions on Friday on war aid for Ukraine and may also touch on concerns that China may provide lethal aid to Russia, a senior US administration official has said. Scholz has urged China not to send weapons to help Russia’s war in Ukraine, and instead asked Beijing to exert pressure on Moscow to pull back its forces. The US will announce a new military aid package for Ukraine on Friday, worth roughly $400m and comprised mainly of ammunition, two officials and a person familiar with the package have told Reuters. The US is hosting war planning exercises in Germany for Ukrainian military officers to help them think through battlefield decisions in the next phase of the conflict, officials have said. A meeting of top diplomats from the Group of 20 industrialised and developing nations in New Delhi has ended with no consensus on the war in Ukraine. Most G20 members strongly condemned the Ukraine war, with Russia and China disagreeing, said the G20 president, India. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, spoke for less than 10 minutes on the margins of the G20 meeting in New Delhi, according to a US state department official. Blinken reiterated to Lavrov that Washington was prepared to support Ukraine’s defence for as long as it took, the official said, in what is believed to be their first one-on-one conversation in person since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Blinken said he told Lavrov that Washington would push for the war in Ukraine to end through diplomatic terms that Kyiv agreed to. Blinken said he had also urged Moscow to reconsider its “irresponsible decision” and return to participation in the New Start nuclear treaty, and that he had also urged Russia to release the detained US citizen Paul Whelan."

                    "headline": "Joe Biden meets Olaf Scholz in effort to keep Ukraine strategies aligned",
                    "bodyText": "Joe Biden has hailed Olaf Scholz for Germany’s “critical military support” for Ukraine, acknowledging in a White House meeting that, in the face of stiff domestic political resistance, such backing had been “very difficult” for the chancellor. The meeting of the US and German leaders on Friday comes shortly after the first anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and at a time when both are facing political challenges to their efforts to maintain the flow of military and economic support to Kyiv. “We made it clear that if [Putin] moved, we would both respond, and together we made good on that promise,” Biden told Scholz at the start of the White House meeting, noting that the last time the chancellor had visited, the Russian invasion was about to be unleashed. “And I want to thank you, Olaf, for your strong and steady leadership. I mean that sincerely. It’s made a world of difference. “You stepped up to provide critical military support, and I would argue, beyond the military support, the moral support you’ve given Ukrainians has been profound.” In response, Scholz stressed the importance of western unity in backing Ukraine and added: “At this time I think it’s very important that we give the message that we will continue to do so as long as it takes.” Scholz came on a working visit to the US, stripped of any pomp or protocol. No press conference has been planned for Friday afternoon’s meeting and the chancellor brought a minimal delegation with him. He described bilateral relations as “a consequential partnership that is really in a very good shape today”. Part of Biden’s message was gratitude for Scholz’s agreement to allow the delivery of armoured vehicles, anti-aircraft systems and 18 German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine, though in a recent interview the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, made clear that the White House had to agree to ship US Abrams tanks too in order to persuade Scholz to act, a characterisation that Berlin disputes. Washington has also voiced admiration for how quickly Germany has reduced its dependence on Russian gas. Before the meeting, the US signalled its willingness to continue backing Ukraine, announcing a new package of military aid, including mobile bridges mounted on armoured vehicles that would be critical to any Ukrainian counteroffensive, as well as more Himars, multiple rocket launchers. Biden will be looking for continuing parallel commitments from Germany and Europe in what is likely to be a pivotal few months in the conflict. “Without question, they’re going to talk about the kinds of capabilities that Ukraine continues to need in the weeks and months ahead,” the US national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said. The administration acknowledges that Scholz has gone a long way to move Germany from a position of pacifist neutrality to providing significant military aid to Kyiv to resist the Russian invasion, but it is also aware he faces considerable resistance inside Germany. Scholz’s chief of staff has cited budgetary constraints as the reason that Germany will not expand its military spending as fast as promised. “It’s really an opportunity to take stock of the war, to examine future scenarios and also think about how leaders on both sides of the Atlantic can sustain momentum as well as support for Ukraine, because electorates are getting war-weary,” said Sudha David-Wilp, a Berlin-based senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund thinktank. In his remarks before the meeting, Kirby noted that Biden and Scholz had recently met Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and said they would want to discuss those meetings. Washington is anxious that Ukraine and its backers stay on the same page in turns of war aims and strategy, in advance of a Nato summit in Lithuania in July. Another item high up the agenda, according to US officials, is China, which Washington believes is on the cusp of breaking precedent and supplying weapons to Russia to help Vladimir Putin sustain the invasion. The US has passed sanctions on some Chinese companies for supplying dual-use items, and has threatened far tougher measures if Beijing starts sending arms. If that happens, Biden would like European support in following suit, and Germany’s response would be critical in raising the costs to China of throwing more support behind Putin. “So far, we haven’t seen that China has provided lethal aid to Russia, but obviously it’s very much a situation that we’re tracking,” the senior US official said. “Russia’s war in Ukraine has put China in a difficult position, and every step that China takes toward Russia makes it harder for China with Europe and with others around the world. It’s a distraction for China and a potential blow to their international relationships that they don’t need or want.” Scholz has publicly warned China about arming Russia, but David-Wilp said imposing broad sanctions “will not be an easy proposition for the Europeans, especially Germany because China is a top trading partner”. She added: “But there is also a growing realisation in Germany that it can’t be business as usual with China. This turning point for Germany has made clear that they can’t necessarily just follow this idea of ‘change through trade’ and not think about the hard power issues involved with trading with autocratic powers.”"

                    "bodyText": "My father, Walter Murgatroyd, who has died aged 101, worked for many years as a researcher in the field of civilian nuclear engineering before becoming disillusioned with the industry’s inability to properly deal with its waste. He then switched to working on thermal power, exploring how to use energy more efficiently and to generate it in new ways. Walter was born in Bradford to Harry, who worked in textile manufacturing, and Martha (nee Strachan), a housewife. He was educated at Blackpool grammar school, after which the second world war interrupted his engineering studies at Cambridge University; he was sent to work on designing engines for fighter jets, first with Hawker Siddeley and then with Rolls-Royce. After the war Walter resumed his studies, staying on at Cambridge to research and design pumps for liquid metals, using electromagnetism rather than moving parts in contact with the dangerous and corrosive fluids. In austerity Britain he required great ingenuity to obtain the necessary materials and craftsmanship for his work. In 1954 he joined the newly formed Atomic Energy Research Establishment as principal scientific officer, responsible for assessment of the various types of nuclear reactor then in development and tasked with working out what resources would be needed. Two years later he was appointed head of nuclear engineering at Queen Mary College in east London (now Queen Mary University of London) – the first such chair in Europe. While there he helped to build an experimental reactor in the Lea valley in London on what many years later was to become part of the 2012 Olympic park. When work began on the site, no trace was found of any radiation, making it one of the safest parts of the otherwise heavily polluted area. By 1968 he had become frustrated with the politics and vested interests of nuclear power generation, in particular the lack of progress on waste disposal, and decided to move away from the sector by becoming chair in thermal power at Imperial College London. There he foresaw the end of the era of cheap fossil fuels, recognising the need to reduce demand for energy – whether by curtailing economic growth, or by using energy more efficiently. He remained at Imperial College until retirement in the early 1980s, and over that period was often called on (via the United Nations or British Council) to advise on energy matters abroad. He was also asked to provide expertise to the energy select committee of the House of Commons. Walter was a good judge of character, and always knew the right questions to ask. Music was hugely important to him, and he could also be great fun. His strong regard for truth and personal integrity gained him wide respect, though it did not always make life easy. He married Denise Schlumberger in 1952; she died in 2014, and their son Alan died in a car crash in 1980. Walter is survived by two other children, Linda and Francis, and three grandchildren."

                    "bodyText": "Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. The relentless battle for Bakhmut Oleh Bendyk showed off a video taken in Ukraine’s eastern forests. It shows a group of soldiers from Bendyk’s 103rd brigade sheltering in a sandy trench. Around them a battle rages. There are explosions, booms, and the rattle of small arms fire. A grad missile crashes down among the pine trees, in a large orange fireball. “Some bastards are firing at us from over there. But we can’t see who they are because of the forest,” a soldier says. He adds: “A Grad now! Do you see how we get hit? It’s been like this since 7am. And now it’s 11am. That’s how it fucking is, folks!” Bendyk and his fellow Ukrainian soldiers have been holding off a surging Russian offensive west of Kreminna, a city that Moscow captured last year. Further along the same front, Ukrainian soldiers are doggedly defending the town of Bakhmut, once home to 70,000 people. Fighting has gone on there for months. Luke Harding reported this story from Kramatorsk. Later in the week, as the battle got even more fierce, Peter Beaumont reported from Kramatorsk, too. The volunteers collecting the civilian dead risk becoming casualties themselves. “Where? Where?” demands Daniel Wilk, a Canadian driver, in shaky video footage shot recently inside the city and seen by the Guardian. Wilk proceeds quickly, the anxiety of the situation visible in his movements as he is directed to a fence, cutting an uncertain path across the snow as another voice cries “no, no” repeatedly. The bodies, when Wilk gets to them, have been cut in half by the force of the explosion that took their lives, and still lie where they fell three days before. Quickly they are bundled up in a sheet to be removed. People who have managed to reach Bakhmut in the past week use the same word to describe what they have experienced: hell. China spends billions on pro-Russia disinformation The west has been slow to respond to China spending billions globally to spread poisonous disinformation, including messaging that is completely aligned with Russia on Ukraine, a US special envoy has claimed. James Rubin, a coordinator for the Global Engagement Center, a US state department body set up to “expose and counter” foreign propaganda and disinformation, made the remarks during a European tour this week. “The well has been poisoned by Chinese and Russian disinformation – it’s pernicious,” said Rubin, a broadcaster and former official in the Clinton administration and broadcaster. Six weeks into the job, he said his aim was not just a passive rebuttal of Russian-Chinese disinformation on Ukraine but to go on the active offensive by urging countries not to harbour those who have been exposed for spreading disinformation. He claimed Russia and China were spending billions of dollars in an effort to manipulate information but said Beijing was operating globally and spending more than Moscow. Patrick Wintour had this story. As US officials spent the weekend reiterating their concerns that Beijing is considering sending lethal weapons to Russia, amid China’s attempts to position itself as a peacemaker and deny that it would provide arms to Moscow, Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and close ally of Vladimir Putin, visited Beijing for a meeting with Xi Jinping. The high-profile trip symbolised the widening gulf between the US and China over the war in Ukraine, Amy Hawkins wrote. Vladimir Putin says west seeking to ‘dismember’ Russia Vladimir Putin has accused the west of seeking to “dismember” Russia and to turn the vast country into a series of weak mini-states, Luke Harding reported. In an interview with the state TV channel Rossiya on Sunday, Russia’s president claimed the US and its Nato allies wanted to “inflict a strategic defeat on us”. The aim, he said, was to “make our people suffer”, adding: “How can we ignore their nuclear capabilities in these conditions?” Russia’s president said this alleged plot had been under way since the collapse of the USSR. “They tried to reshape the world exclusively on their terms. We had no choice but to react,” he said, adding that the west was complicit in Ukraine’s “crimes”. If Washington got its way, Russia would be divided into Moscow, the Urals, and other disparate regions, he said, claiming there was “written proof” for his assertion. Ukrainian Nobel peace laureate calls for special tribunal to try Putin A Ukrainian Nobel peace laureate has called for the swift creation of a special tribunal to try Vladimir Putin and his associates for the crime of aggression, arguing that it could have “a cooling effect” on daily atrocities committed by the Kremlin’s invading forces, Jennifer Rankin reported from Brussels. Oleksandra Matviichuk, the head of the Centre for Civil Liberties, said a speedy start to war crimes trials against the Russian president and soldiers could save people’s lives by deterring Russian forces from committing further crimes. Belarusian partisans blow up Russian plane near Minsk Belarusian anti-war partisans claim to have severely damaged a Russian military aircraft in what an opposition leader has called the “most successful diversion” since the beginning of the war. Andrew Roth and Peter Beaumont reported this story. BYPOL, the Belarusian partisan organisation, said it had used drones to strike the Machulishchy airfield 12km from Minsk, severely damaging a Beriev A-50 airborne early warning and control aircraft (Awacs). “One of the nine Awacs of the Russian aerospace forces worth $330m [was destroyed],” the group said. “These were drones. The participants of the operation are Belarusians. [They have attained] ‘Victory’ and are now safely outside the country. Everyone has escaped.” The plane “definitely won’t fly anywhere”, it added. Russia planned Kherson’s torture centres, lawyers said Evidence collected from Kherson in southern Ukraine shows Russian torture centres were not “random” but instead planned and directly financed by the Russian state, according to a team of Ukrainian and international lawyers headed by a UK barrister. The city was under Russian control for eight months, from 2 March 2022 until Ukrainian forces entered on 11 November. The lawyers, called the Mobile Justice Team, said on Thursday they had investigated 20 torture chambers in Kherson and concluded they were part of a “calculated plan to terrorise, subjugate and eliminate Ukrainian resistance and destroy Ukrainian identity”, Isobel Koshiw reported. The evidence collected by Ukrainian prosecutors and analysed by the Mobile Justice Team includes plans used by Vladimir Putin’s occupying forces to establish, manage and finance the 20 torture centres in Kherson. “The mass torture chambers, financed by the Russian state, are not random but rather part of a carefully thought-out and financed blueprint with a clear objective to eliminate Ukrainian national and cultural identity,” said the British barrister Wayne Jordash, who is leading the team. More than 1,000 survivors have submitted evidence and more than 400 people have vanished from Kherson, the lawyers say. Mariupol residents’ shock at Putin’s parade lineup At the climax of the pageantry in Moscow to mark the first anniversary of the start of Vladimir Putin’s full-scale war in Ukraine, the Kremlin wheeled out children from Mariupol in occupied south-east Ukraine to “thank” their invaders. The star of this orgy of Russian patriotism was Anna Naumenko, a 15-year-old with black hair, who was pushed on to the stage of Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium to thank a soldier nicknamed “Yuri Gagarin” for rescuing her: “Thank you Uncle Yura for saving me, my sister and hundreds of thousands of children in Mariupol.” Anna’s sister, Karolina, covered her ears against the noise of the crowd as she stood nearby. As the Ukrainian children crowded round to hug the soldier, their former neighbours from Mariupol felt shock and disgust, Andrew Roth reported. These were children they had huddled with in basements less than a year earlier, sheltering from Russian bombs and suffering from hunger and cold as Moscow launched a bloody onslaught that destroyed the city. “The abomination is that these are not actors,” wrote one. “They are really children from Mariupol.” Pointing out another child, he added: “That teenager in a black hat and grey jacket hugging the occupier is Kostya, my neighbour. We lived in the same building, and spent the first month of the war in the same shelter.”"

                    "bodyText": "Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner group, has called on President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to order a withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut. Bakhmut is “practically surrounded” by Wagner fighters with only one route left for Ukrainian forces, Prigozhin said in a video published today. The video has been geolocated to the village of Paraskoviivka, 4.3 miles north of the centre of Bakhmut. Ukrainian forces have blown up a railway bridge inside the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, according to a report. Video of the controlled explosion, posted on social media and geolocated by CNN, was shared widely today along with unconfirmed reports that it was a sign that Ukraine was preparing to withdraw from the city. Russia is deploying the most experienced units of the mercenary Wagner group and the country’s army in an attempt to seize the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, the Ukrainian military has said. The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, was pictured visiting the frontline city on Friday for briefings with local commanders on how to boost defence capacity. Ukraine has ordered a mandatory evacuation of families and vulnerable residents from Kupiansk and adjacent northeastern territories, amid fears that Russian forces will retake the frontline eastern city and rail hub. Russian troops retreated from key cities in the northeastern Kharkiv region, including Kupiansk, and Ukraine recaptured it last September. The evacuation order was due to the “unstable security situation” caused by Russia’s “constant” shelling of the town and its surroundings, the Kharkiv regional military administration said. Foreign ministers of the so-called Quad group denounced Russia’s threat to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war as unacceptable, according to a statement issued after a meeting on Friday. The ministers also said they opposed any unilateral actions to increase tensions in the South China Sea, and expressed concerns about the “militarisation” of disputed territories, in a thinly veiled reference to China. The Quad group includes India, Australia, Japan and the United States. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the office of the president of Ukraine, has again issued a denial that Ukraine has mounted any attacks within Russian territory. President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday Russia had been hit by a “terrorist attack” in Bryansk, and vowed to crush what he said was a Ukrainian sabotage group that had fired at civilians. Ukraine accused Russia of staging a false “provocation”. The Kremlin said Friday it would take measures to prevent a repeat of what it described as a border incursion. Ten people remain considered missing and five people ar enow known to have died when a missile hit a residential building in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Thursday morning. Volodymyr Litvinov, head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson, has reported that a tractor driver has been killed by Russian shelling in the area. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian proxy who operates in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region has claimed on Telegram that Ukrainian forces are shelling Enerhodar, the city which stands next to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is also reporting military action at the ZNPP, stating “Employees of the security agencies of the Russian Federation came under aimed fire on the line of contact when meeting International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors who were rotating at the ZNPP.” Belarus has sentenced the Nobel peace prize-winning dissident, Ales Bialiatski, to 10 years in prison as part of Alexander Lukashenko’s purge of opponents after the 2020 pro-democracy protests against his rule. Bialiatski, a pro-democracy activist, is the founder of Viasna, the authoritarian country’s most prominent human rights group. He was detained in July last year and charged with smuggling cash into Belarus to fund his group’s activities, but is widely recognised as being persecuted for his opposition to Lukashenko. Bialiatski was awarded the Nobel peace prize alongside the Russian human rights organisation Memorial, and the Ukrainian human rights organisation Center for Civil Liberties, in October. Joe Biden, the US president, and Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, will focus their discussions in Washington on Friday on war aid for Ukraine and may also touch on concerns that China may provide lethal aid to Russia, a senior US administration official has said. The US has announced a new military aid package of ammunition and other support for Ukraine worth $400m (£333m). The package will be funded using presidential drawdown authority, which authorises the president to transfer articles and services from US stocks without congressional approval during an emergency, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. The US is hosting war planning exercises in Germany for Ukrainian military officers to help them think through battlefield decisions in the next phase of the conflict, officials have said. Switzerland’s defence ministry on Friday said it had received a request from its German counterparts to allow Rheinmetall AG to acquire some of Switzerland’s mothballed Leopard 2 tanks. The request said the tanks would not be sent to Ukraine, but would be used to backfill gaps created by the handover of Leopard 2s by Germany and Nato and EU allies. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday that Russia “will not let the west blow up gas pipelines again” and said that Moscow would no longer rely on the west as an energy partner. Mikhail Abdalkin, a member of the Samara regional Duma, has been charged with “discrediting the Russian armed forces” and will go on trial on 7 March. Abdalkin posted a photograph of himself on Telegram on 21 February listening to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s state address with what appeared to be noodles draped over his ears."

                    "bodyText": "The chief of the Russian paramilitary group Wagner has said his fighters have “practically encircled” Bakhmut, the eastern Ukraine city the Kremlin has been trying to seize for months. Only one road remains under Ukrainian control, Yevgeny Prigozhin added in a video posted online in which he called on the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to abandon the city. While the claims by the head of the mercenary group could not be confirmed, the situation in the embattled city appeared to be extremely precarious, amid evidence Ukraine was preparing extensive new defensive positions, including around the nearby city of Kramatorsk. Large amounts of military traffic were seen on nearby roads on Friday, and there were claims that several bridges near the city had been destroyed. Video posted online showed the blowing up of a railway bridge over the Bakhmutka River to the east of the city, while other footage purported to show damage to a small road bridge. Russian shelling was seen hitting routes leading west out of Bakhmut, in what appears to be an attempt to block Ukrainian forces’ access in and out of the city. Amid mounting speculation that Ukraine’s defenders might be preparing to withdraw, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the national security and defence council of Ukraine, said that in the battles for Bakhmut its defenders had inflicted casualties on the Russian attackers at a ratio of 7:1. “It is difficult there, but keep in mind that every day our boys and girls send hundreds of them to where they are supposed to go, given that they came here to kill us,” Danilov said. Volodymyr Nazarenko, a deputy commander in the National Guard of Ukraine, told Ukrainian NV Radio the situation was “critical”, with fighting going on “round the clock”. The commander of a Ukrainian drone unit active in Bakhmut, Robert Brovdi, who goes by the name “Madyar”, said in a video posted on social media that his unit had been ordered by the military to withdraw immediately. He said he had been fighting there for 110 days. On a visit to the western city of Lviv to see wounded soldiers recuperating in hospital, Zelenskiy thanked those who had been injured during the “heroic defence” of Bakhmut. Statements on social media issued by Ukrainian soldiers fighting in the Bakhmut area appeared to suggest they were holding their positions, although under intense pressure. “Friends, at the moment there is no withdrawal of troops from Bakhmut,” said one soldier from the 93rd mechanised brigade on Twitter. “Fighting continues in all areas of the city, the 93rd stands and continues to perform the tasks assigned to it. The situation is actually complicated, but trust only official sources and do not panic.” In the video posted by Prigozhin, recorded on a building’s rooftop four miles north of Bakhmut, the Wagner chief claimed his forces were increasingly fighting against old men and children rather than the professional Ukrainian army. The footage showed what looked like three captured Ukrainians – an older man and two young boys – who looked frightened and asked to be allowed to go home. They appeared to be talking in what looked like a choreographed appearance under extreme stress. On Thursday, Prigozhin had released another video showing his fighters inside Bakhmut. Reuters geolocated the footage to the east of Bakhmut, about 1.2 miles (2km) from the city centre. Ukraine has vowed to defend “fortress Bakhmut” but it has faced Russian troops determined to seize the city, whose symbolic importance now outstrips its military significance. Ukrainian officials said the fighting was becoming increasingly difficult, after Russia claimed several villages near Bakhmut in recent weeks. The latest fighting came as the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, flew to Washington to meet President Joe Biden in Washington later on Friday. Also on Friday, the US indicated it was set to announce additional military aid for Ukraine in a $400m arms package expected to include ammunition for existing systems."

                    "bodyText": "One tank that is not on its way to Ukraine is Britain’s latest super-tank, the Ajax. It has been more than 10 years in the planning and £5.5bn in the building, but it doesn’t work. Its tracks suffer from speed bumps and its interior keeps injuring its drivers. If I were the mythological warrior Ajax, I would sue for my reputation. It is nearly a quarter-century since Tony Blair unveiled his doctrine of so-called humanitarian interventionism. This was in support of the UN’s grandiose declaration of a “responsibility to protect” human beings everywhere. As Margaret Thatcher had liberated the Falklanders, so Blair would liberate Kosovans, Iraqis, Afghans and Sierra Leonians. The UK now has military bases in 42 overseas countries, from Oman to Mali, from Kenya to Belize, an outreach shared with no other European state. An ever-powerful defence industry lobby has since kept British defence spending at around 2% of GDP, supposedly an indication of military might sufficient to deter an aggressor. This deterrent is now being tested by Vladimir Putin. His attack on Ukraine is presented by hawks as a threat to Nato and the entire west. Though the nuclear deterrent is holding, that of Nato’s implied conventional response did not, at least a year ago. Putin appears to have validated decades of warnings by defence historians that the cold war will never be over. Russia must be seen as an ever-present enemy; Putin agrees. Just as Nato risked confrontation in advancing east in the 1990s, he felt justified in advancing into Chechnya, Georgia and Donbas. It is not so much cold war as old war and it has left Whitehall floundering. Is defence really about global influence or rather about Nato solidity – and if the latter, how should the money be spent? Britain’s procurement of extravagant weapons feeds the vanity of politicians of all parties . Aircraft carriers were supposed to be phased out in the 1960s with the end of empire. Blair authorised their reinstatement in 1998 for expeditionary power projection (after a defence review on which I served). David Cameron refused to cancel them in 2010. Johnson recently sent one of these dinosaurs, HMS Queen Elizabeth, to the South China Sea. Another, HMS Prince of Wales, was meant to help boost trade down the east coast of America. It broke down at sea and returned to port. Both have to use US planes, with US permission. In the same company is the Ajax armoured vehicle, the Lightning fighter jets, the £31bn Dreadnought submarines, Project Mensa for nuclear infrastructure and the Morpheus military communications system. One follows another into wild overspend and delay. For a medium-sized European power this is beyond parody. Each year the defence secretary has to plead or bully Downing Street for more cash while their department shows incompetence that would have an NHS trust in special measures overnight. It is hard to quarrel with the defence analyst Paul Rogers’ description of these weapons as no more than “delusions of post-imperial grandeur”. Every country needs defending, even one as ostensibly secure from territorial threat as the UK. This operates at two levels. It means an army aiding civil authority in a crisis, be it riot, terrorism or pandemic. Covid saw 20,000 soldiers on stand-by. Beyond that, an army is needed to support alliance activities, primarily Nato. Here the commitment is more discretionary. That Russia’s invasion of Ukraine constitutes a true existential threat to all of Europe is absurd. But it certainly threatens frontier states to which Nato boldly offered absolute security guarantees. Either way it must cause those, like myself, who saw no point in nuclear deterrence, to pause. To what extent Britain should be tooled up for a land war in Europe is a dilemma that any non-expert must find hard to resolve. One thing is for sure: for all the glamour of ships and planes, it is armies that matter. But what matters even more than their size is the politics of their deployment. Two years ago, the US soldier and academic Sean McFate dared to ask Why the West Doesn’t Win Wars. His answer lay not in soldiers or their equipment. It lay in the decisions – so often bombastic, reckless and thoughtless – that drove them to war in the first place. Putin’s war on Ukraine has shown the same weakness as did the west’s war against the Taliban: that no force is more powerful than the will to defend one’s own soil. Largely for this reason, it has been estimated that four wars in 10 are won by militarily the weaker side. The British government has decided to cut its army by nearly 10,000 troops. No layperson can judge what impact this may have on operational effectiveness – let alone deterrent value – because the “operation” is conjectural. It still leaves a force of 73,000 ground troops. There is talk of this being insufficient to take over from Germany in leading Nato’s high-readiness command. It has left the Tory defence select committee chairman, Tobias Ellwood, calling it “a reduction in our hard power that would diminish our international standing and ability to sway opinion on the world stage”. I could say the same of Brexit. What shines through these arguments is a divergence between these images of 20th-century conflict and what defence may mean in the future. Russia has been proved weak on the battlefield, but not in its cyberwar, domestic brainwashing, diplomatic manipulation and resistance to sanctions. Its hold is unyielding on Iran, Syria and certain countries in Africa. Threats are also changing. The seas have become as permeable as the skies. Unmanned weapons enable armies to go further and be more reckless. Drones are transformational, except in occupying territory. Even here soldiers are being supplanted by mercenaries. The Russians use prisoners most effectively. Half the Americans serving in Iraq and Afghanistan were contractors. Much in today’s defence debate hinges on how a Labour government will respond. It has long been terrified of cutting defence, of being portrayed as weak or appeasing. At very least Keir Starmer may snap out of Britain’s “post-imperial” delusion. Modern defence should be what it says on the tin: about defence. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has recently spoken of taking it “budget by budget”, seemingly de-escalating the arms race. He sounded at least common sensical. Perhaps for the first time in decades, Britain’s defence has what it most needs: a secretary of state for sanity. • This article was amended on 5 March 2023.

                    "bodyText": "And with that, we are going to put the blog to bed. Thank you so much for spending part of your day with us. Before we go, let’s recap the big headlines: The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has urged China not to supply weapons to Russia after she met with her Chinese counterpart Qin Gang on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in India yesterday. The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, says the government is working to restore trust with the community on national security threats. O’Neil told an ANU podcast she felt “really troubled” that the previous government’s approach involved a “reflex willingness to politicise national security issues”. The government services minister, Bill Shorten, has called Stuart Robert’s defence “peak bizarre” after Robert yesterday admitted to the robodebt royal commission that he had said things he believed were “false” because of “cabinet solidarity”. NAB chief executive Ross McEwan came out and supported the government’s proposed superannuation changes, saying: “I think it’s a move that probably needed to be made.” NSW has recorded 7,163 Covid cases and 29 deaths while Victoria has recorded 3,016 cases and 23 deaths. Hot on the heels of announcing its record $1.43bn half-year profit last week, Qantas Group has revealed plans to grow its employee numbers from 23,500 to 32,000 by 2033. An upper house committee into alleged corruption in the Hills Shire council was scathing on Dominic Perrottet’s brothers’ failure to appear before inquiry; Charles and Jean-Claude Perrottet were among those found to have deliberately avoided the inquiry. Sally Rugg’s case against MP Monique Ryan and the commonwealth has returned to the federal court. The agriculture minister, Murray Watt, has announced a group of four Australians to lead a consultation process around phasing out live sheep exports. The education minister, Jason Clare, has signed a sweeping new mutual recognition agreement of qualifications between India and Australia, the cornerstone of his trip with university delegates this week. Australia, the US, India and Japan have announced a new Quad working group on counter-terrorism to “counter new and emerging forms of terrorism, radicalisation to violence and violent extremism”. Residential NBN services decline in number for first time From AAP: The number of residential NBN services has declined for the first time, according to figures showing connections between NBN Co and retailers. Services in operation fell by 9,000, or 0.1%, to 8.73m in the December 2022 quarter, the ACCC’s NBN Wholesale Market Indicators Report said on Friday. A spokesperson for the NBN said: About 20 million Australians use the NBN network each day which means there is a smaller pool of potential new users of the network. Combine that with the completion of the build (and) you see more modest new connections. The top three providers – Telstra, TPG and Optus – lost a total of 95,000 services to shave their market share to 77.9%. But Vocus and other smaller providers gained about 86,000 services, to 1.9m. They now have 22.1% of the market, up from 14.6% two years earlier. About half of all services are for 50 megabits a second while 20%, or 1.8m homes, are getting 100Mbps or more. The federal court has released new details of Sally Rugg’s case against independent MP Monique Ryan and the commonwealth, including witness statements from Ryan and her chief of staff. Rugg has sued the commonwealth and Ryan for alleged adverse action after the MP purportedly dismissed her chief of staff from her employment for refusing to work unreasonable additional hours. Australian share market recoups some losses but stays in the red The local share market has managed to claw back some of its losses but still finished in the red for the fourth straight week, AAP has reported. The S&amp;P/ASX200 on Friday finished up 28.2 points, or 0.39%, to 7,283.6, leaving the benchmark index down 0.3 points since last Friday’s close and down 3.6% from its 3 February finish. The broader All Ordinaries on Friday gained 24 points, or 0.32%, to 7,484. The day’s gains came after a solid session on Wall Street, where the S&amp;P500 lifted three-quarters of a per cent after some dovish FedSpeak from a non-voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Fed Bank of Atlanta president Raphael Bostic said overnight the US central bank “could be in a position to pause” rate hikes by the northern hemisphere summer. Speaking in New Delhi, Penny Wong played down G20 foreign ministers’ meeting’s failure to issue a joint statement. The foreign affairs minister said everybody knew there were “differences of views between great powers” over the war in Ukraine (at least two G20 members – China and Russia – have objected to including strong language denouncing Russia’s invasion of the country). But Wong said whatever the difficulties on those issues, the G20 “must continue to cooperate” on other issues, including climate and development: These can only be dealt with together - I think humanity learned that through the pandemic. Australian government to send rapid assessment team to Vanuatu in wake of Tropical Cyclones Judy and Kevin The Australian government has announced it will deploy a rapid assessment team to survey cyclone damage at the request of the government of Vanuatu. In statement issued a short time ago, the federal government said: The 12-person team and an initial assistance package will be transported to Vanuatu on a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft as soon as weather conditions allow. The team includes officers from federal, state and territory partners with a range of disaster, health, infrastructure, power and humanitarian assessment capabilities. The rapid assessment team will survey the impact of Tropical Cyclone Judy, and Tropical Cyclone Kevin. RAAF aircraft will also assist the Government of Vanuatu with aerial damage assessments. Australia’s initial package of assistance includes shelters, water purification supplies and other essential items for impacted communities. The Australian Government is working closely with partners such as France and New Zealand to support the Government of Vanuatu’s response. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said the Australian defence force was coordinating closely with the Pacific family to provide the best support possible. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, added: We are providing rapid assistance to support those who have been affected by this disaster. We are committed to working with the government and people of Vanuatu to support the recovery. Australia, the US, India and Japan have announced a new Quad working group on counter-terrorism to “counter new and emerging forms of terrorism, radicalisation to violence and violent extremism”. The announcement comes after the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, met today with her counterparts for a Quad foreign ministers’ meeting in New Delhi, India. She is expected to hold a press conference shortly. But the joint statement issued by the four countries outlines concerns about the changing nature of terrorism: We note with deep concern that terrorism has become increasingly diffuse, aided by terrorists’ adaptation to, and the use of emerging and evolving technologies such as unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and the internet, including social media platforms for recruitment and incitement to commit terrorist acts, as well as for the financing, planning, and preparation of terrorist activities. We welcome the focused discussions on these themes at the Quad Counter-Terrorism Policy Meeting and tabletop exercise hosted by Australia in October 2022. We are pleased to announce the establishment of the Quad Working Group on Counter-Terrorism, which will explore cooperation amongst the Quad, and with Indo-Pacific partners, to counter new and emerging forms of terrorism, radicalization to violence and violent extremism. We look forward to its first meeting in the United States in 2023 to continue our discussions on this global issue. More broadly, the Quad countries said they were determined to deepen engagement with regional partners to strengthen maritime domain awareness – including countering illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight. There is expected to be a Quad Maritime Security Working Group meeting hosted by the United States in Washington DC later this month. The Quad statement includes the following concerns alluding to China: We recognize that peace and security in the maritime domain underpins the development and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific, and reiterate the importance of respect for sovereignty, consistent with international law. We reiterate the importance of adherence to international law, as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to meet challenges to the maritime rules-based order, including in the South and East China Seas. We strongly oppose any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo or increase tensions in the area. We express serious concern at the militarization of disputed features, the dangerous use of coast guard vessels and maritime militia, and efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation activities. Australia, the US, India and Japan also agreed on a form of wording about “the conflict in Ukraine and the immense human suffering it is causing”. (India has tended to be reluctant to be as strong in explicitly condemning Russia.) The Quad countries agreed “that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible” and “underscored the need for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter”. NSW government “buck-passing” on fast rail The Perrottet government has been accused of “one of the greatest examples of buck-passing in recent memory” for quietly abandoning its vision to build its own dedicated fast rail line between Sydney and Newcastle. On Friday, Guardian Australia revealed that after four years and roughly $100m spent on feasibility studies on the fast rail line, work on a final business case was abruptly halted in mid-December. Confidential documents seen by Guardian Australia show the New South Wales government now considers further planning for a dedicated fast rail line on the corridor to be a task for the commonwealth and its yet-to-be operations high speed rail authority, which will itself restart feasibility studies. Responding to the revelations, Committee for the Hunter chief executive, Alice Thompson, told the Newcastle Herald “if the Liberal National NSW government has handed over responsibility for a project that doesn’t even cross borders to the feds, this will be one of the greatest examples of buck passing in recent memory”. A Transport for NSW spokesperson confirmed the scaled back vision, saying the department is only “progressing business cases for in-corridor faster rail improvements to existing lines while planning progresses with the Australian government for a national high speed rail network”. However on Friday, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, insisted his government’s long-term vision still includes a fast rail network in the state. “What you do as a government during the budget period is you make investment decisions based on the plans that you’ve set out.” Perrottet added: As you move forward, you prioritise your projects in a way that is affordable and sustainable, that sets out the future vision … That’s what we’ve done as a government. Deputy opposition leader, Prue Car, criticised Perrottet for having taken a taxpayer funded trip to Japan where he rode a bullet train and talked up NSW’s high speed rail vision. “Now he actually needs to comment and give assurance to the people of NSW whether this is happening or not. If not, this is just another Liberal broken promise.” Read more: Sodden summer was pretty average, temperature-wise Technically summer’s behind us, but it’s always worth a check on how the season turned out. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, summer was about 27% wetter than average, which was probably not surprising since it contained the tail end of a third consecutive La Niña event in the Pacific: As the chart suggests, the north was wetter than usual, with the Northern Territory having its seventh-wettest summer on record. Other parts started to dry out a bit, with rainfall in NSW about 35% below average for the season, and the Murray-Darling Basin as a whole down 37%. Victoria was off 22% too. Temperature-wise, it could hardly have been closer to the averages. For mean temperatures, summer was just 0.07 degrees above the 1961-90 benchmark used by the bureau. The pattern was surprisingly similar for both daytime and overnight readings. The area-averaged national mean maximum temperature was 0.04 degrees above average, while the national mean minimum temperature was 0.09 above that norm. There are always quirky numbers, such as Sydney’s December being the coolest for minimums since 1967. Most sites in Brisbane had less than 70% of their typical summer rainfall. Perth, too, was dry with the metro area recording just 1.4mm for the summer, and the driest since the summer of 2009-2010 when just 0.2mm fell (that was the record driest). Oddly enough, given how dry conditions were, the WA capital notched up only its fourth summer without a 40C day (the first since 2017-18). Given the background warming from climate change is about 1.5C for Australia since 1910, the odds are banking up for relatively hot weather over time. Speaking of hot matters, some excitable scribes (hello, Daily Telegraph) have been talking up the prospect of “monster heatwave” early next week for parts of eastern Australia. Yes, it will feel warm with 36-38C predicted for parts of Sydney, and even 35C for Brisbane by Wednesday. But as far as heatwaves go, it barely registers, according to the bureau’s heatwave monitor: Perhaps those mild La Niña-like summers have softened a few of us up. The National Farmers’ Federation has released a statement responding to the agriculture minister Murray Watt’s earlier announcement the government has set up a panel to consult on the phase-out of live sheep exports. Tony Mahar, chief executive officer, said: The NFF stands with 24 other peak agricultural bodies and farmers across Australia in opposing the ban on live sheep export, and does not support any process which aims to phase out the trade. Cancelling an entire industry based on activist demands sets a dangerous precedent. What industry will be next? To wrench a key export market out from the Australian economy will have far reaching impacts on jobs and livelihoods in Western Australia, as well as our economy, agricultural systems and trade relationships. Our customers in the Middle East rely on the live sheep trade – and a range of other products – to put food on the table. We saw in 2011 the damage it can do to a bilateral relationship when you pull the pin on a country’s food supply. It risks compromising Australia’s reputation as a reliable supplier of high quality food and fibre. We are an export orientated industry – if Government starts cancelling export markets this send a seriously bad message to farmers. The policy is based on an outdated campaign by welfare activists that ignores the significant animal welfare improvements made through heavy investment in new infrastructure and practices. The industry has been open and transparent about the reforms it has made. University of Adelaide receives $1.8m to study Indian agriculture sector The University of Adelaide has received $1.8m in federal government funding to undertake a year-long project into India’s agricultural sector. The project will seek to identify “critical and emerging jobs” to meet India’s emerging agricultural skills needs, employing stakeholders from vocational training and agricultural sectors in both countries. Dr Tamara Jackson, a senior research fellow with the University of Adelaide’s school of agriculture, food and wine, is the lead researcher on the project. This project will research, design and deliver pilot training products, in partnership with stakeholders from the Australian international education sector and Australian and Indian agriculture sectors. We will explore partnerships between industry and education providers of both countries through the co-development of occupational standards for critical and emerging job roles across India’s key agriculture sub-sectors. The project will run until 2024. It’s the latest in a string of announcements made by Australian universities during a delegation to India with the education minister, Jason Clare, as the sector aims to capitalise on the nation’s sweeping new education plan. NT deputy commissioner acknowledges ‘military-like’ police unit at Walker inquest From AAP: NT’s deputy police commissioner, Murray Smalpage, has returned to the stand for a fifth day to give evidence at a coronial inquest into the death of Indigenous teen Kumanjayi Walker. Smalpage defended the “militarisation” of the NT police force and its heavy reliance on guns on Thursday. He said he could see how people perceived a unit like Rolfe’s as military-like. He also said he knew communities “would much prefer we didn’t carry firearms,” but guns were essential to the police force. The inquest also heard admissions by a police officer that controversial text messages that may have influenced Constable Zachary Rolfe’s defence to a murder charge were not meant for him. Rolfe fatally shot Walker, 19, three times as he resisted arrest in Yuendumu, north-west of Alice Springs, on 9 November, 2019. Afterwards, Rolfe received text messages telling him to justify his intent as self-defence against “the s*** c*** (who) was telling him that he was going to stab the police”. But Sgt Ian Nankivell, who wrote the messages, told the inquest into the fatal shooting he “emphatically denied” that the messages were for Rolfe. The minister for housing, Julie Collins, has rejected an assertion from the Greens today that the housing Australia future fund won’t go far enough to assist renters. She said the $10bn plan was the “single biggest investment” from the federal government in social and affordable housing in more than a decade: Standing in the way of legislation to create the fund will risk every single dollar of returns from this $10bn investment. It will also risk the 30,000 social and affordable houses that the fund will support in its first five years, including 4,000 homes for women and children impacted by family and domestic violence or older women at risk of homelessness. I am continuing to have constructive conversations with representatives from right across the parliament about this critical legislation. The Coalition will oppose the legislation in the House, while the Greens are calling for a set of “negotiating aims”, including a minimum of $5bn invested in social and affordable housing every year and removing the $500m cap. They are also urging the government to adopt a national freeze on rent increases and an immediate doubling of commonwealth rent assistance in the budget. 20 red-tailed phascogales to be released in NSW national park to mark World Wildlife Day From AAP: More than 20 red-tailed phascogales – a near-threatened carnivorous marsupial – are set to be released in a national park in NSW after a 450km journey from a breeding program at Adelaide zoo. To mark World Wildlife Day, the 11 females and 10 males will be released on Friday night into a fenced area of the Mallee Cliffs national park in the NSW Sunraysia region. They will add to the population of 93 released into the national park over the past two years, with the tiny mammals previously considered locally extinct. Zoos SA’s conservation coordinator, Lisa West, said each animal had been fitted with a collar to allow their transition to their new environment to be monitored. “That will give us vital information into their movements and behaviour,” West said. The collars are designed to break off in four to six weeks. The red-tailed phascogale was once found across most of arid and semi-arid Australia, but they now occupy just 1% of their former habitat. Calls for royal commission on Indigenous child deaths An Aboriginal justice leader has called for a royal commission over mounting Indigenous child deaths, suggesting it could lead to another stolen generation, AAP has reported. The number of Aboriginal kids dying who are known to Victoria’s child protection services has risen crazily in recent years, the Aboriginal Justice Caucus’ co-chair, Chris Harrison, said. “More children have passed that have been linked to child protection ... than that have died in the justice system,” the Wotjobaluk man told the Yoorrook justice commission on Friday. The commission for children and young people’s 2021/22 annual report found Aboriginal children and young people were over-represented in its inquiries into kids who died within 12 months of their last involvement with child protection. Two Aboriginal children and young people were among the 37 notified child deaths last financial year and made up seven of its 41 completed child death inquiries. Thirteen of the 45 kids known to Victoria’s child protection services who died over the 2020/21 financial year were Aboriginal. Harrison said the revelations in the most recent report should have been front page news, but were hidden in the data and among of a raft of 265 government documents tabled on December 20. SA reforms government contract spending rules to focus on local jobs From AAP: Interstate companies and contractors may find it more difficult to secure South Australian government contracts under changes to the state’s spending rules. The government spends $8.5bn a year on goods and services across areas such as hospitals, schools and various departments and agencies. Under the procurement reforms, it will lift the spend allocated to SA businesses by 5%, or about $425m. In other changes, local workers must deliver at least 90% of labour hours on major infrastructure projects and any contracts worth more than $55,000 awarded to interstate or overseas suppliers must be approved by a departmental chief executive. At least 20% of labour hours on major projects will be required to be delivered by apprentices, trainees, Indigenous workers and the long-term unemployed. The state’s treasurer, Stephen Mullighan, said the government should support local suppliers and local jobs wherever possible when spending taxpayers’ money. “These changes are designed to get more public spending into the pockets of local businesses and workers,” he said. Universities Australia welcomes Indian mutual recognition agreement Universities Australia - the peak body for the tertiary education sector - has welcomed Clare’s adoption of the new mutual recognition agreement for qualifications. Universities Australia CEO, Catriona Jackson, said it marked another “huge step forward” in Australia’s education partnership with India: India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world and a very important strategic partner. We have huge opportunities in front of us to support India’s education reform ambitions and to diversify our education offerings to reach new cohorts of students – for the benefit of both our nations. Under the rules, students can use their qualifications where they wish to work. This will help with skill shortages and drive deeper connections in the important areas of research and development. Since the pandemic, interest from Indian students in our world-class universities has soared to new heights as the country sets about educating 500 million students by 2035. Our unis are here to help. This is a golden period in our education relationship with India. We must grasp it with both hands. India is currently Australia’s second largest and fasting growing source of international students with 128,979 Indian students enrolled with Australian providers as of December, behind only China. The education minister, Jason Clare, has signed a sweeping new mutual recognition agreement of qualifications between India and Australia, the cornerstone of his trip with university delegates this week. Clare and India’s minister of education and minister of skill development and entrepreneurship, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, signed the mechanism – the most comprehensive education agreement of its kind in India – during a meeting in New Delhi. It means an Indian student will have any degree obtained from an Australian university recognised if they want to continue higher education in India. Pradhan and Clare also reaffirmed their intention to establish an Australia India working group on transnational partnerships - expected to report to ministers at the next Australia India Education and Skills Council (AIESC) meeting later this year. Clare and Pradhan next meet later this year when they co-chair the AIESC meeting with Brendan O’Connor, skills and training minister. Clare: This week’s signing reflects the strong and mutually beneficial relationship between India and Australia. Australia’s universities are well placed to contribute to India achieving its domestic education goals and to supporting the skills and employment needs of key Indian industries. Australian universities have publicly cited their commitment to deepening partnerships with Indian universities – including the possibility of setting up campuses – to capitalise on the nation’s sweeping new education plan. Also today, a further 11 memoranda of understandings were signed between Australian and Indian education counterparts. Some academics have raised concerns over establishing campuses in India, citing the potential for compromised academic freedom and a heavily bureaucratic system. Earlier today school kids once again hit the streets for School Strike 4 Climate – and some of these signs are spciey! I’ve saved the best till last – so scroll down. Agriculture minister: ‘everyone can have their say’ Watt says while this will just involve WA farmers, it’s a national issue: I think we do need to recognise that, while Western Australia is now the only state that is exporting live sheep, this is an issue that has nationwide interest. There are people in the west, the centre and the east of our country who have strong views about this issue, and we think that we have put together a balanced panel that represents the diversity of views, the diversity of interests – and that way, everyone can have their say. Watt: ‘really big opportunities’ even after live export ban Watt is back up – he says banning live export won’t put farmers out of business: I’m not sure that we necessarily are facing a situation where farmers will lose their business or go out of business. I mean, as a result of this phase-out, obviously the export of live sheep would end but, as I say, we think there are some really big opportunities, particularly when it comes to onshore processing. And we want to see more value-adding in Australia. And I think that’s got a lot of potential here. But any issues around compensation and structural adjustment and those kind of things are exactly the kind of things we’re going to be asking the panel to give us advice on, and we’ll consider their recommendations when we receive them. Phillip Glyd is up: We’re very keen to engage with all stakeholders that are involved in this, whether it be the people who do the producing on-farm, the people who do the transporting, feedlotters, people who are involved in the overseas trade, the overseas destination markets – we need to talk to all of them. What we’re planning to do is, first of all, hold a lot of meetings with people face-to-face and virtually to try and cover all of those issues. We also have a process for receiving written submissions for people who can’t make those sort of meetings. We’re trying to get around to cover everybody. Agriculture minister: Labor still committed to supporting livestock industry Watt says that in the meantime the government is committed to supporting the ag industry: For instance, by continuing to invest about $160m in upgrades for rail networks to support the WA grains industry. By investing $5m to improve biosecurity for northern Australia – something that’s really vital for the cattle industry in WA. And of course, we’ve recently agreed with the Western Australian government to repair the Fitzroy Crossing bridge and there’ll obviously be a lot of jointly funded roadworks that are really critical for WA’s agriculture sector as well. Watt: around 12% of sheep raised in WA are sent for live export It’s 12% of the overall industry are sent for live export. We know that the live exports constitute … less than 1% of Western Australians’ overall agriculture exports. But we intend to work with that part of the industry that is involved in this trade to make sure that they do continue to have opportunities into the future. And in particular, one of the things that we’ve asked the panel to look at is what opportunities there might be to expand onshore processing of sheep meat. Australia already exports 50 times as much sheep meat by value, compared to what we export in live sheep. And we think there are real opportunities to expand that trade over the coming years, with new markets being opened up in the UK, in India and, all going well, in the EU as well. Watt: live export phase out to be done in a ‘orderly, considered way’ Watt says the panel will report back to him by September 30 this year with recommendations. I‘ve said on a number of occasions that we want to do this in an orderly, considered way. The Albanese government understands that this is a big adjustment for many people here, particularly in Western Australia. We want to do it in an inclusive way through good consultation with people. We’re not going to rush it. Both the prime minister and I have said publicly that this phase-out will not be implemented in this term of parliament because we do want to take the time to get it right and help industry transition to a new and different future compared to what it’s been doing. He is announcing a group of four Australians to lead a consultation process around phasing out live sheep exports. Four eminent Australians, very well-qualified, geographically spread, with the right mix of skills needed to take on what will be a complex task in consulting the community and coming up with recommendations to the government about how and when we should implement this commitment. The former CEO of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, Phillip Glyd, will chair the panel and he will be joined by WA farmer Sue Middleton, the former CEO of the RSPCA Heather Neil and the former Labor minister for agriculture Warren Snowdon. Phasing out live exports has been in the works for a while, but not within this term of government: The agricultural minister, Murray Watt, is speaking now in WA about the live sheep export trade. And with that, I leave you in the hands of Cait Kelly. Thanks for reading. $800,000 suite built for Richard Marles’ office was part of refurbishments that started before election Some more details on the curious case of the $800,000 ministerial suite that was built for Richard Marles without anyone telling him or his team: Freedom of information documents - first reported by News Corp - have now been released on the Department of Defence’s disclosure log. They show bureaucrats and an external contractor having a email exchange on 7 October 2022 that included plans for the relocation of the deputy prime minister’s personal items from one level of the Defence building in the Canberra suburb of Russell to the higher-level new office: Your team will commence packing the DPM’s office early next week and advise if there’s any furniture to be relocated … Please let me know if there’s anything I’ve missed. As it turns out, the thing that was missed was to inform Marles’ staff that this was even in prospect. The issue came to light when the Department of Defence’s draft answers to Senate questions on notice (QON) were sent to Marles’ office for approval. Marles’ chief of staff, Jo Tarnawsky, wrote to the head of the Department of Defence on 25 October to complain: Alarmingly, the QON responses identify for the first time that a new office has been constructed for the deputy prime minister and at significant cost ... The deputy prime minister does not need nor did he request an office be purpose built for him or any other minister. He was at no time briefed about Defence’s decision to create an executive suite nor the relocation of ministerial signage identifying the suite as his. The deputy prime minister will not be taking occupancy of the newly constructed executive suite on level 5. Any signage that has been relocated from his current office on level 2 to level 5 should be relocated to its original location as a matter of urgency. Tarnawsky ended the email with this request for nothing like this to be repeated in future: Effective economic management and appropriate allocation of commonwealth resources is the cornerstone of this Government’s policy mandate. I look forward to more open communication and consultation in the future. The secretary of the Department of Defence, Greg Moriarty, replied to say he had made some checks and could “confirm that neither the deputy prime minister nor his office were engaged on the topic of departmental works to develop additional executive office accommodation in Russell”: The additional executive suite is being delivered as part of an approved series of refurbishments of executive offices and workspaces in Russell. The project, which started in April 2022, will increase density, accommodate an expanded workforce, and deliver safety and security upgrades. (The election was in May 2022.) NT education union says state uni sector review is ‘mistimed, misdirected and lacks transparency’ The National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) has raised “serious concerns” over a review into Western Australia’s university sector, announced by the premier Mark McGowan and education minister Dr Tony Buti last week. The union said the review was “mistimed, misdirected and lacks transparency”, warning against the possible push to merge or amalgamate the state’s four public universities. NTEU WA’s division secretary, Dr Catherine Moore, said the review “inexplicably” favoured closed-door consultations over public submissions and didn’t make sense amid the ongoing university accord process. It is being led by four independent experts, including former vice-chancellors and deans of universities. Moore: Purpose needs to be the foundation of any review - but even that isn’t clear. It doesn’t make sense to have a state review when the federal government is canvassing the biggest changes to the sector in more than a decade through the so-called accord process. We’re calling on the WA government to rule out examining merging the state’s universities as a result of the review. It’s hard to see how any merger or amalgamation proposal could exist without mass job losses. Public universities are a public good. Their mission to provide quality teaching, research, infrastructure and expertise to communities must be at the core of any review. It beggars belief that consultation is limited to vice-chancellors and ‘relevant stakeholders’ when staff, students and the public must be at the heart of the process. In a statement, McGowan and Buti said the review would investigate changes that may help support the “performance and financial sustainability” of the state’s four public universities, a sector that had become “increasingly constrained”. Between 2010 and 2019, WA had the smallest percentage growth in university enrolments in Australia (13.6% in WA, compared to 32.3% across Australia). In 2020, WA attracted only 5.5% of Australia’s international student revenue. A final report is expected in the second half of 2023. Erin Molan and Daily Mail to enter mediation after appeal Sky News broadcaster Erin Molan and the Daily Mail will enter mediation and potentially go to a new trial. Last year, Erin Molan was awarded $150,000 in damages after suing the Daily Mail for defamation. She said an article had accused her of appearing to mock Polynesian names after she used the phrase “hooka looka mooka hooka fooka” in a discussion about the pronunciation of rugby league players’ names on radio station 2GB in 2020. Justice Robert Bromwich found rather than mocking those names, she was imitating a colleague, Ray Warren, who had himself struggled to properly say the names. The Daily Mail appealed the finding, and on Thursday played a series of clips of Molan and her colleagues putting on a range of accents to give context to the “hooka looka mooka hooka fooka” statement. Federal appeals court judges said today there had been an “error” in the initial judgement and that Bromwich may not have paid attention to the evidence in the broadcasts. They decided the matter would go back to a new trial, but the court also referred Molan and the Daily Mail to mediation before that trial. Malcolm Turnbull to appear before robodebt inquiry next week The former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, will front a royal commission into the robodebt scheme next week. Turnbull, who was prime minister when the scheme exploded in controversy in early 2017, is scheduled to appear on Monday, according to a schedule released by the inquiry this morning. The inquiry has heard Turnbull had raised concerns about the program with the then minister, Alan Tudge, following an article by the Sydney Morning Herald’s Peter Martin that suggested the program could be illegal. Turnbull is also said to have proposed that the CSIRO’s data specialty team, Data61, look into the program in early 2017. He was still prime minister when the scheme was switched back on in August 2017. The secretary of the department of human services at the time, Kathryn Campbell, will also front the commission for a third time. The former Commonwealth ombudsman, Michael Manthorpe, whose office has faced scrutiny during the inquiry, will also appear, as will a key former official from his office, Louise Macleod. The ombudsman’s appearance is significant because it cannot be compelled to appear. Sally Rugg’s counsel says there is evidence that Monique Ryan has a new acting chief of staff ‘from Climate 200’ Sally Rugg’s counsel, Angel Aleksov, has revealed that there is evidence from a work Slack channel that Monique Ryan has a new acting chief of staff. He said: There is evidence a new chief of staff is seconded from a private organisation and paid on a private basis ... someone from Climate 200 ... paid for, it seems, outside the [Member of Parliamentary Staff] Act. Aleksov is arguing that because the alleged replacement is privately funded, there is still a MOPs Act-funded position for Rugg to go back to. Aleksov said the alleged new chief of staff also rebutts evidence from Ryan that if she reinstates Rugg to a different role she will be without a chief of staff. Simon Holmes à Court told Guardian Australia that Climate 200 had not provided a chief of staff to Ryan. Rather, “a staff member of Climate 200 approached their manager asking for leave without pay in order to fill the gap in Ryan’s office”. There was no communication between Climate 200 and Ryan on this staffing issue. [This was done] completely at arm’s length, with no initiation from Climate 200. Interest rate hikes flowing through to depress housing loan demand, ABS says Higher interest rates are continuing to pound demand for loans in the property sector, with new commitments falling 5.3% in value in January, seasonally adjusted, the ABS says. That’s a tad faster than the 4.3% pace of decline in December alone, and more than 3% clip CBA (the biggest issuer of mortgages) had predicted. The value of new loan commitments for housing was $22.1bn in January 2023, with new owner-occupiers borrowing $14.7bn of that (down 4.9%). New investor loan commitments fell 6% to $7.4bn. From a year earlier, the overall drop was 35%, hinting at the drop of turnover in the market (rather than prices, which are about 9% off their highs of about a year ago, ANZ estimates). First-home buyers get a bit of attention and the outlook was not promising here either, with the number of loans for such borrowers sinking 8.1% in January. “Owner-occupier first-home buyer lending continued to decline from the high reached in January 2021,” said Mish Tan, ABS’s head of finance and wealth statistics. “The decline coincided with the winding down of Covid-19 pandemic stimulus measures.” (Good use of correlation rather than causation, it should be noted.) First-home buyers’ loans are now 57.5% lower than that peak just over two years ago, and are 27.5% less than the pre-pandemic level seen in February 2020, the ABS said. By some quirk, the ACT and the NT saw a bounce in January of about a fifth for first-home buyer loans. All the rest of the country went backwards, led by 12.7% in NSW and 11.5% for Victoria. “Anecdotal feedback from lenders suggested that reduced borrowing capacity due to rising interest rates further dampened overall demand for new housing loans in recent months,” Tan said. That point about reduced borrowing capacity because of those rising rates was cited as a reason rents are going up so much in this well-commented on article from the start of this week: Of course, the RBA is set to add to reduce that capacity to borrow even more. As of yesterday, investors were betting the central bank would lift its key interest rate another 25 basis points next Tuesday to 3.6% as a three-in-four chance. Something not really to look forward to. Deputy PM gives update on internal Tiktok review The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, gave an update on the ongoing government review into whether platforms like TikTok should be allowed on government phones (some departments, like Defence, have already said no to TikTok). There has been a clampdown in the United States and Canada. Marles told reporters today: Home affairs is going through a process right now of reviewing social media platforms and their place on government phones and government equipment, and we will take advice from the relevant intelligence agencies about that in terms of the appropriateness of any given social media platform in respect of any device that is used throughout the Australian government. But obviously, there are differing levels of security which apply to different devices in different places. A Defence phone needs to be more secure than a phone for the parliament. But we’ll take the advice from our relevant security agencies and intelligence agencies about how best to deal with. Minns calls for suspension of Hill Shire council New South Wales opposition leader Chris Minns has called for the suspension of a Sydney council at the centre of a parliamentary inquiry examining allegations of “impropriety” by property developers and councillors. On Friday, Minns told radio station 2GB the allegations surrounding the Hill Shire council in north-west Sydney - which have been referred to the state’s independent commission against corruption - warranted its suspension. My view is clearly the council has to be suspended pending a full investigation. I mean, the government is proposing an additional 100,000 people move into the Hills Shire over the next 15 to 20 years. We have to have confidence in the public administration of this council. That’s a matter for the minister for local government if we’re elected. But my view is very clear, there’s got to be some integrity here. There needs to be measures in place so that everybody in that community – the council officers, the voters, the community, even the members of the Liberal party who were expelled – have got confidence that this thing is on the level. The parliamentary report handed down on Thursday followed weeks of attempts to call a series of witnesses to give evidence over allegations senior members of the Liberal party received payments from property developers in order to install councillors favourable to their development applications. Government response to strategic review to be released in April, Marles says Richard Marles’ press conference was called to announce “that Nine Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force is being re-formed after a break of 34 years”. But it quickly turned to other matters. The defence minister cited Australia’s supply of rapidly assembled cardboard drones to Ukraine as “an example of Australian ingenuity”. He added: In respect of the cardboard drones, that is a very cool technology, which is seeing service in Ukraine right now, it has been developed with the assistance of the government, and we’ll continue to work with the government of Ukraine to see about its ongoing usefulness - and they certainly are very excited about it. Marles reiterated that an unclassified version of the defence strategic review - and the government’s response to it - would be released in April (as he announced earlier this week). This is separate from the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine announcement, which is expected in coming weeks. On the submarines, he said: And it does involve a really significant hardening of security in a physical sense with buildings and fences and the like, but also in an IT-sense around the information which goes with that. And we’re very cognisant of the challenge that’s involved in that. The announcement that we will make will talk about the way in which we intend to meet that challenge. And I think there is a high degree of confidence within both United States and United Kingdom about Australia’s ability to do that. Guardian Australia revealed last week that the Australian government had imposed strict new security rules at the Adelaide site where nuclear-powered submarines will be built, as part of the latest moves to reassure allies that sensitive military secrets will be protected. At today’s press conference, Marles also said decisions on the infantry fighting vehicle project - known as Land 400 Phase Three - were being handled by the defence ministry minister, Pat Conroy. Marles said he did not have any personal conflict of interest, but because one of the tenderers is based in his electorate it was “it is the right thing to do to have minister Conroy bring that program forward - and it’s very much in his hands”. Sally Rugg’s counsel, Angel Aleksov, has revealed that one of the reasons that Monique Ryan lost confidence in her chief of staff was because Rugg travelled on an aeroplane with Covid. Aleksov said that Rugg received a “formal warning about travel with Covid” and Rugg’s affidavit explained that the reason was that it was “on doctor’s advice”. Justice Debra Mortimer said this is “going into submissions about why Ms Rugg, when she had Covid, travelled on an aeroplane”. Aleksov said he is trying to show why travelling with Covid was not a “major factor” in loss of trust between the pair. Justice Mortimer said that Ryan’s position was “not irrational”. This back and forth is Aleksov trying to show that Rugg and Ryan could still work together, which is airing fresh details about the breakdown in their working relationship. Marles ‘not comfortable’ with new office The defence minister, Richard Marles, says he is “not comfortable” with his department’s decision to spend $800,000 on an upgrade to build a new office for him at Defence headquarters in Canberra - and he won’t occupy it. Today is not the first time we’ve heard about this issue - or the fact that Marles did not plan to occupy it - but Marles was questioned about it at a press conference in Avalon, Victoria, after the release of new documents under freedom of information laws. It surrounds the creation of an executive suite on level 5 of Defence headquarters in the Canberra suburb of Russell - to replace his existing office on level two. News Corp reported that the work had been done, complete with Marles’ embossed name on the door. It also reported that FOI documents showed Marles’ chief of staff wanted to know how the expensive work could have happened without “any knowledge or consultation with our office” and wrote: The deputy prime minister does not need nor did he request an office be purpose built for him or any other minister. Marles told reporters today he “wasn’t told that this was happening before it happened”. Marles said he did believe it was important for him to have an office to use when at the Department of Defence, but he was happy with the existing one rather than the new ministerial suite: The office that I occupied had a couple of thousand dollars spent on it to refurbish it to allow me to occupy it and I’m really comfortable with that. I’m definitely not comfortable with what was being proposed, and so that’s not an office that I intend to or have occupied ... I didn’t ask for that [expensive] office. I wasn’t advised that that was what was going to happen. I’m not going to occupy it. I’m really happy to occupy the office that I do, which was refurbished at the expense of a couple of thousand dollars on one of the lower floors of Russell. Justice Debra Mortimer has cast doubt on whether it would be convenient to order that Sally Rugg keep her job pending the final trial. Mortimer said Rugg is “inviting the court to supervise” her working relationship with Monique Ryan or else letting her keep her job is “simply unworkable”. Mortimer questioned how “two people who have different views” about what reasonable hours are can be “ordered to continue to work together”. Rugg’s counsel, Angel Aleksov, said that Rugg was not “work-shy” and had offered to do community engagement work requested by Ryan, provided that tasks are reprioritised and some of her other duties are given to other staff. NSW bans no-grounds evictions No-grounds evictions are set to be banned in NSW, along with a host of other initiatives intended to support struggling renters. At a press conference this morning, NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, confirmed that his party would push through changes that would roughly align with proposals from Labour and the Greens, cementing changes as the election looms. The Coalition has proposed a “reasonable-grounds” model for evictions for periodic leases, as well as extending notice periods for the end of fixed-term leases from 30 days to 45 days, introducing optional longer lease agreements of three or five years, a portable bond scheme and regulating data-collection from renters. Perrottet told reporters the measures would offer protections to renters across the state, amidst a stinging rental crisis: These new measures will provide even greater certainty and flexibility for nearly a million renters across NSW. We are supporting renters to get into housing in a fairer way, without stressful bidding wars where people get pushed beyond their comfort levels. Our ban on solicited rent-bidding is already improving affordability for those looking for rentals. For background on this story, from Guardian journalist Stephanie Convery: Rugg’s wage didn’t justify 70-hour weeks, counsel argues In the federal court, Sally Rugg’s counsel, Angel Aleksov, is going through her terms and conditions of employment. Aleksov said that despite the “day-to-day” description of Rugg’s role as Monique Ryan’s chief of staff, she was paid in the mid $130,000-$140,000 range, which the enterprise agreement “treats as a non-senior role”, less than half what some staffers earn ($270,000). Aleksov notes there was also a payment for additional hours, but argues these still had to be reasonable. As an example, he said five additional hours a week might be reasonable for a staffer who didn’t take the payment, while 15 may be reasonable for someone who did. That payment could be worth $32,000, which Aleksov says is in the range worth eight to 10 hours extra work a week, as a proportion of staffer salaries. Rugg’s case is essentially that, even if staff take the payment, there is not an unlimited number of additional hours they can be asked or required to work. Aleksov said that Rugg worked 70-hour weeks, exercised a right to refuse unreasonable additional hours, and was the subject of “retaliation”. He said: “Ordinary human experience tells us that payment of $130,000-ish with a $30,000-ish top up doesn’t justify working 70 hours a week, week-in week-out.” Derryn Hinch winds up Justice party, urges supporters to ‘maintain the rage’ Former senator Derryn Hinch has announced the end of his political party after it was wiped out of the Victorian parliament at the November state election. Hinch first entered federal parliament under the banner of Derryn Hinch’s Justice party in 2016, with three MPs following him in the Victorian parliament at the 2018 election, though Catherine Cumming quickly defected to sit in the upper house as an independent. Hinch lost his Senate seat in 2019. At the 2022 state election, he made a failed attempt to enter Victorian parliament, while MPs Stuart Grimley and Tania Maxwell were not re-elected. In a Facebook post earlier this week, he announced he would be formally deregistering the party: This is one of the saddest moments of my life. I am announcing the end of the Derryn Hinch’s Justice party. We aspired to much and achieved a lot. One seat in the federal Senate and then three seats in the Victorian upper house. All have now gone. To be blunt, there is no point in the party continuing to exist. Our (and your) commitment has cost a lot in time and money since I launched the DHJP in September, 2015. Hinch thanked Grimley and Maxwell, as well as their staff, saying they should be proud of what they achieved. Personally, even though the Justice party will no longer exist, I shall publicly (and privately) keep fighting over perceived wrongs and real injustices. You never give up. Thanks to all our supporters over more than seven years. Maintain the rage. Data reveals discrepancy in student-teacher ratios Public schools teachers are under pressure, with higher student-teacher ratios than private schools across Australia, new data shows. The data, released by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (Acara) found the full-time equivalent student-teacher ratio is 12.8 for private schools - including Catholic and independent - and 13.6 for government schools nationally. The split is most striking in secondary schools, where the student-teacher ratio is 12.4 at public schools compared with 10.5 at independent providers. The Greens said the results were due to decades of underfunding of public schools that has led to a widening gap between private and public schools. Greens spokesperson for schools, senator Penny Allman-Payne: To attract more teachers to public schools and provide a world-class education for our kids, governments must properly fund all public schools and pay all public school teachers more. Right now, nearly every public school in the country is receiving less than 100% of the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS), which is the minimum funding level required for students to achieve the minimum standard. “The government wants to roll out a PR campaign to raise the status of teaching, and that’s great. But if there’s anybody that can see through being given a gold star, it’s teachers - we invented it. Education minister Jason Clare has committed to ensuring every school reaches 100% of its funding under the SRS. Allman-Payne said funding to private schools had increased at five times the rate of funding to public schools. Australia has one of the greatest education funding inequality gaps in the OECD. This needs to be reversed. There’s no point in trying to cajole more teachers into the profession when public schools are underfunded, pay and conditions are going backwards and morale is low. Sally Rugg’s case against MP Monique Ryan and the commonwealth has returned to the federal court. Rugg is seeking an injunction to keep her job, pending a final hearing. Rugg’s counsel, Angel Aleksov, told the court on Friday that Rugg was “pushed or jostled” into resigning on 23 December. Aleksov said that Rugg’s letter of resignation “did not” terminate her employment, because Ryan “did not accept its immediate effect”, but purported to give it effect on 31 January. He said: We say that combination of those circumstances is that termination of employment didn’t occur on 23 December when the letter was furnished. It only occurred when given effect to, which we say was a constructive dismissal, on 31 January. That date was extended by undertakings to 5pm today. So, Rugg’s counsel is arguing that she is still employed, in order to support getting an injunction to keep her in the job. NSW government enters caretaker mode ahead of state election Get excited, New South Wales – there’s a state election coming! From today, the NSW government has entered the caretaker period, which basically means no major decisions, appointments or contracts will be entered into as the campaign ramps up – and no political material will be posted across the state government’s socials. The period runs from the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly until the election result is clear and we have a winner. Defence minister Richard Marles is at the Avalon Air Show this morning. He says the government’s formal response to the Defence Strategic Review – set to foster the biggest defence shake-up in nearly four decades – will not be released to the public this month. Read more on the review from Daniel Hurst: The NSW parliament has officially entered caretaker mode ahead of the general state election on 25 March, during which government activity will slow to a minimum, AAP reports. While routine government business will continue as usual, as a general rule, no significant new decisions, initiatives, appointments, or contractual undertakings are made during the period. It comes after the government prematurely adjourned parliament from the start of the week, sparking questions over whether an upper house committee into alleged corruption in the Hills Shire council would continue to sit. The committee delivered its report as one of the final acts of the 57th NSW parliament on Thursday evening, with a scathing assessment of key witnesses who avoided providing evidence. Committee chair Sue Higginson said the deliberate failure of witnesses, including two of premier Dominic Perrottet’s brothers, to appear before the inquiry was unprecedented. Charles and Jean-Claude Perrottet, property developer Jean Nassif, Liberal party operative Christian Ellis and his mother, Hills councillor Virginia Ellis, were all found to have deliberately avoided the inquiry. Higginson said in the report the contempt shown for the committee’s role raised serious questions about the operation of the Liberal party in NSW. The only way this committee could shed some light on these allegations is for those involved to come forward and give their account. Their coordinated, deliberate and serious efforts to evade scrutiny inevitably leave the perception that there is something to hide. The report recommended the influence of property developers on the council be probed by the state’s independent commission against corruption. It also recommended a further inquiry be established by the next parliament with a view to the involvement of both Perrottet brothers as well as Ellis and Nassif. “This inquiry has raised questions that are too serious to leave unanswered simply because this parliament has run its course,” Higginson said. For this reason, the committee has recommended that a new inquiry into these matters be established in the next parliament. NSW energy minister announces funding for hydrogen hubs NSW’s energy minister and treasurer Matt Kean will use his final morning as caretaker rules kick in to provide as much as $64m to support two green hydrogen hubs while opening applications for $1.5bn in concessions for large-scale green hydrogen producers. As we saw last month, there’s a hydrogen race that’s underway globally thanks to the open-ended US Inflation Reduction Act (which is mostly about decarbonisation). Anyway, NSW’s spending will go to hubs in the Illawarra near Wollongong and Moree all the way up near the Queensland border. Kean said that the world-class incentives were part of the NSW hydrogen strategy to expand the state’s economy by an estimated $600m each year from 2030 and attract an estimated $80bn in private investment by 2050. Big bickies if it can be pulled off – but, as mentioned above, the challenge for Australia is to get to scale fast enough to be competitive given our relatively meagre funds and talent pool. In our favour, we have some of the best renewable energy resources in the world. “These globally competitive incentives will attract investors and industry to establish their operations in NSW, driving decarbonisation in heavy industry and pushing down green hydrogen costs to reach our target of under $2.80 per kilo by 2030,” Kean said. A Deloitte study released about a week ago put the competitive gap between green hydrogen (from renewables) and grey/blue hydrogen (from fossil fuels ... and should really be ‘black hydrogen’) at about $5 a kg v $3 a kg. Hence there’s some challenge to get down to $2.80. “This funding will see the first green hydrogen produced in the Illawarra, with at least four refuelling stations set to be developed in and around the Illawarra which can power up to 40 trucks and buses in the region,” Kean said, hinting at the small initial size (but you have to start somewhere). The Moree plant would convert green hydrogen into green ammonia used to fertilise cotton and other farms across the region, which is an interesting twist. “At the same time, green hydrogen producers across NSW are now able to access $1.5bn in concessions to reduce costs for large scale investment, including up to a 90% reduction in their electricity network charges if they connect to parts of the grid with spare network capacity,” Kean said, detailing how those concessions are supposed to work. “These incentives will set us up for success as we compete with the high-profile US Inflation Reduction Act hydrogen incentives, because the NSW concessions can apply to projects finishing well beyond 2030, while the US program finishes in 2032,” he says. (The IRA may, of course, be extended and some commentators have noted it is so far not capped in funds.) Still, hydrogen will need to play a role including replacing fossil fuels in the hard to electrify parts of the economy in industry and heavy transport. Guardian Australia will have more on the state’s decarbonisation efforts soon. Stay tuned for that. Qantas will increase its workforce by 8,500 over the next decade, as it announces a new engineering training facility. Hot on the heels of announcing its record $1.43bn half-year profit last week, Qantas Group has revealed plans to grow its employee numbers from 23,500 to 32,000 by 2033, with the additional roles including pilots, engineers, cabin crew and airport staff across Qantas, Jetstar, Qantas Link and Qantas Freight. The recruitment drive comes after the airline shed just under 10,000 jobs during the pandemic and, notably, outsourced 1700 ground-handling jobs in a move that was ruled illegal – a decision Qantas is now challenging in the high court. Staffing shortages remain chronic across global aviation, with many skilled workers who left during the pandemic opting not to return to the sector. Last year, shortages compounded issues stemming from rising absenteeism as well as the soaring appetite for travel that saw airlines struggle with on-time performances, delays, mishandled baggage and customer service backlogs. “Aviation jobs typically require specific skills, and so underpinning the recruitment drive is a massive commitment in training that will create a long-term pipeline of talent for the Qantas Group and Australian aviation more broadly,” the Qantas statement said. As part of its recruitment mission, Qantas will establish its own engineering academy with capacity to train up to 300 engineers a year. The airline has announced a multi-million commitment to create the academy, which is expected to open its doors to the first students in 2025, but has not yet selected a location – something that will be announced by the end of the year. Qantas Group chief executive, Alan Joyce – who will leave the airline by the end of this year – said the recruitment drive would also account for natural attrition. “If you’ve ever wanted to work in aviation or at the national carrier, now’s a great time to join,” he said. Minister for skills and training, Brendan O’Connor, said: Australia needs thousands of new workers and engineers to enter the aviation industry to ensure secure jobs and a thriving sector and we welcome this investment by Qantas to help develop these future skills needs. Covid data has just dropped from NSW and Victoria, with NSW reporting 7,163 new cases, with 29 deaths over the past seven days. It’s a bit of a jump in cases, with NSW cases climbing to their highest levels since January, although there is a drop in deaths since last week. In Victoria, 23 people died in the past week, with 3,016 new cases reported. Case numbers are very similar to last week, although Victoria has also reported a drop in deaths week-on-week. Government investigates ending live sheep exports AAP is reporting that Australia is on the way to phasing out live sheep exports by sea. The federal government has appointed an independent panel chaired by the former CEO of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and senior public servant, Phillip Glyde, to lead a six-month consultation process to map out the steps to the shutdown. The panel also includes Western Australian agriculture expert Sue Middleton, former federal Labor Northern Territory MP Warren Snowdon and former RSCPA CEO Heather Neil. “Phasing out live sheep exports by sea is a complex issue that will impact farmers, businesses, our trading partners, and the communities that participate in the trade,” agriculture minister Murray Watt said on Friday. I am also conscious that the wider Australian community is interested in the phase-out, including those that want to see animal welfare maintained and improved. Watt said he wanted to ensure the phase-out was orderly, adding it wouldn’t take effect in this term of the Labor government. The live sheep export trade is worth about $85 million a year. The panel will provide its report to the government by September 30. Shorten takes aim at those rorting NDIS Bill Shorten is making the rounds this morning, telling people who are rorting the national disability insurance scheme to “rack off.” The minister for the national disability insurance scheme was on 2GB earlier, where he said the “good times” for those who exploit the scheme are over, saying he was determined to clean it up: The scheme is delivering life changing positive outcomes for a lot of power but there is a lot of … undesirable conduct happening. We need to make sure every dollar gets through to the people for whom the scheme was designed. There’s issues with fraud and crime but also with overservicing and overcharging. Just rack off, you’re not welcome, get off my scheme. Five major events taking place in Sydney this weekend Sydney is facing one its busiest weekend since the 2000 Olympics, with the New South Wales transport chief operations officer Howard Collins counting at least five major events across Saturday and Sunday. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, he said it would be the biggest weekend in 23 years as Harry Styles concerts coincide with the end of WorldPride in Sydney, the return of the NRL, and the Sydney Kings playing in Homebush. He warned that motorists should be aware that some major roads, including the Harbour Bridge, will be closed: What we are seeing now is a return to big concerts. Ed Sheeran last weekend, 85,000 and we shifted a good proportion of that and it went smoothly. We are reminding people, get there early. Olympic Park opens the doors to your seats at 5pm. There is plenty of events going on and get there early for the Harbour Bridge closure. Motorists, it will be shut at 4am [on Sunday] and open at 11.30. We are asking people to retime your journey if you don’t need to be in the area. Enjoy, the weather will be great. It will be a great event. Have some patience, there will be queues but we want to get most people to and from the events safely by public transport. NAB chief executive Ross McEwan has just wrapped up an interesting interview on RN Breakfast, in which he came out and supported the government’s proposed superannuation changes. McEwan said “$3m is a lot of money” as he explained that he believed it was a move that “probably needed to be made”: $3m is a lot of money to have in a super fund and I’m sure I’ll put myself out there and people will say, ‘He should never have said that’. But I think $3m is a lot of money. And that 4% return on that. I’m pretty sure after tax somebody could live on $120,000, it’s not a bad sum of money. So I think it’s a move that probably needed to be made. Let’s consider it won’t affect 99.5% of Australians. It will affect a small group of people who had a huge amount of money in those funds, I’m sure they’ll find other things to do with it. So that’s just a reality of where we are. We’re all going to have to play our part to get this economy back into shape, (and) get the debt down. For some background on this story from senior business reporter, Jonathan Barrett: ‘A broken promise writ large’ Opposition leader Peter Dutton was also on the Today show (which has clearly been busy this morning). He, predictably, said the government had gone from “disaster to disaster”: They want to tax you on the profit before you actually sell the shares, which is unbelievable. And I think it continues to go from disaster to disaster for the government. You can’t as a prime minister look people in the eye and tell them one thing and do the complete opposite, a broken promise writ large. Super changes ‘modest’, Richard Marles says Deputy PM Richard Marles has come out and defended the government’s proposed changes to superannuation, echoing Wayne Swan’s description of them as “modest”. Speaking to Nine’s Today show, Marles said the government had also inherited a budget in heavy debt and it needed to be “responsible”: It is a modest change ... It only affects people if you have $3m in your superannuation fund. That’s about 0.5% of superannuants. We inherited a budget from Peter [Dutton] and his crew which was a trillion dollars in debt. There’s nothing to show for it. We need to be responsible. That’s what we’re trying to do. ‘Melbourne is back’ Melbourne’s deputy lord mayor, Nicholas Reece, has claimed “Melbourne is back” after sharing that pedestrian traffic in February 2023 was higher than February 2019. It’s the first time that Melbourne has had a month that was higher than pre-pandemic levels and, with a series of events being held at major cities around the country, it might not be exclusive to Melbourne: Media attacks on proposed super changes ‘hyper-stupidity’, Wayne Swan says Former Labour treasurer Wayne Swan has called media criticism of Labor’s proposed superannuation changes “hyper-stupidity”, adding that the changes were only “modest”. Speaking on Nine’s Today show he said that while the government had faced some criticism for the proposed changes, it was “just doing what every Treasury has ever done”: Jim Chalmers is the 41st treasurer of Australia. Every other treasurer of Australia before him would have handled the announcements the way he has. The difference here is hyper-stupidity in the media and some of the stories that have beaten it up to the point it’s not even recognisable as the original proposal. Swan defended the government, saying it was attempting to “legislate the purpose of super, which is for retirement, and to make sure that most Australians have a decent retirement with a decent accumulation in their super scheme”: You can’t achieve that objective if there are parts of the system where there is a large amount of public money going to people on very huge incomes. Superannuation is about a decent retirement for average Australians. We begin with government services minister Bill Shorten, who was on RN breakfast this morning criticising the idea that cabinet solidarity would result in ministers misleading the public. This comes after former minister Stuart Robert yesterday admitted to the Robodebt royal commission that he had said things he believed were “false” because of “cabinet solidarity”: Here’s Shorten’s take: I think it’s peak bizarre that you can say that cabinet solidarity allows you to give false statements. Cabinet solidarity means you’ve got to support a policy but I don’t think it means that you’re allowed to make up facts to support the policy Cabinet solidarity, in essence, is a doctrine which says that cabinet ministers can talk through policies in the sanctity of cabinet. But once a decision is made they all have to support it. That’s fine. But I do not believe that the doctrine of cabinet solidarity extends to giving permission for people, for ministers, to give false statements about the lawfulness of their actions or to misrepresent facts. Shorten was then asked if there could be any “consequences” to misleading the public: This is new ground, I think in terms of someone just saying what they said the royal commission still has to make a determination. So if listeners can hear some hesitation on my voice, I don’t want to get ahead of the royal commission. You’re meant to resign if you don’t agree with the policy and you can’t support it. Mr Roberts evidences that they had massive personal misgivings but clearly not enough to make him resign. Robert’s extraordinary admission is analysed in an excellent piece this morning by Luke Henriques-Gomes: Good morning, Mostafa Rachwani with you today, to take you through the day’s news. Kumanjayi Walker inquest continues More Northern Territory police force members are due to give evidence at a coronial inquest into the death of the Indigenous teenager Kumanjayi Walker. The inquest continues on Friday after hearing on Thursday about a series of controversial text messages sent by a NT police sergeant and forwarded to Constable Zachary Rolfe after Walker’s death. At the inquest, the sergeant called the messages a “horrible mistake” which he hoped would not mean Aboriginal people in the NT lost faith or confidence in the police. Rolfe fatally shot Walker, 19, three times as he resisted arrest in Yuendumu, north-west of Alice Springs, on 9 November 2019. He was found not guilty by a supreme court jury of Walker’s murder. Read Guardian Australia’s coverage of yesterday’s inquest hearing here: The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, says the government is working to restore trust with the community on national security threats, warning that the public will stop listening if the issue becomes a matter of partisan politics. In an interview with the Australian National University’s national security podcast, O’Neil said she felt “really troubled” that the previous government’s approach involved a “reflex willingness to politicise national security issues, and particularly to talk about China in a way that I felt was highly politicised”. She expanded on some of the points about foreign interference and democratic resilience she made in her National Press Club speech in December and in an earlier podcast interview with Guardian Australia’s Katharine Murphy. O’Neil told the ANU’s Prof Rory Medcalf: I really want people to understand politicisation of these issues is dangerous, it reduces the government’s ability to help protect Australians. And if I can pick one thing that will change under the new government in Australia, it is that we’re here for the national interest. And these things are too important to be toyed with, we can’t do anything that reduces government’s power to solve these problems with the population. O’Neil said Australians “are really smart, and they know when politicians are politicising matters”. That meant people had “stopped listening – and we can’t afford to have that happen”. She also vowed to push for more “transparency and openness” about national security threats, saying she read vast amounts of intelligence reporting “and you can’t read these reports and think anything other than the Australian people have to know more” about the ways in which “people are trying to interfere without our politics and our security”. The government had “tried to open up the doors a little bit”. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has urged China not to supply weapons to Russia after she met with her Chinese counterpart on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in India yesterday. She said she had also raised trade issues, human rights and consular cases. Wong’s meeting was with Qin Gang, who has been serving as China’s foreign minister since late 2022. Wong previously held talks with then-minister Wang Yi in Beijing in December, after earlier meetings on the sidelines of last year’s G20 and UN general assembly events. Wong told reporters in New Delhi after the latest meeting: I will continue to assert that both parties [Australia and China] can grow our bilateral relationship while safeguarding our national interests if we both navigate our differences wisely. I was grateful for the opportunity to engage on important matters including trade, human rights and consular matters as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Wong repeated the argument that “it would be in both countries’ interests for those trade impediments to be removed” – referring to China’s tariffs and other restrictions on a range of Australian export sectors including barley and wine. Asked about China’s proposed peace plan in relation to Ukraine, Wong began by saying the responsibility for the war in Ukraine and the flow-on impacts on global energy and food insecurity – as well as the suffering of the Ukrainian people – “lies at the feet of Russia and we must never forget that and never resile from that”. She said China was one of the five permanent members of the UN security council: I’ve previously said that the world does look to China for its responsible leadership when it comes to Ukraine, particularly given its closely relationship with Russia. I would note that President Zelenskiy himself has said he wants to believe that China will do the right thing and not supply weapons to Russia – and that is not only Australia’s call but the call of all countries. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian Australia live blog. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be trying to bring you up to date with the overnight breaking news before Mostafa Rachwani comes along. Our top story this morning is about a legal challenge by an Afghan man who argues that Karen Andrews’ decision to cancel his visa in 2021 is void because Scott Morrison’s multiple ministerial appointments displaced her as home affairs minister and meant that she didn’t have the authority. It could lead to all decisions made between April 2021 and the 2022 election being challenged. From one home affairs minister to another – and more backwash from the former Coalition government – come in comments from Clare O’Neil, who says her predecessors had a dangerous tendency to politicise national security issues. She tells a podcast that she felt “really troubled” that the previous government had a “reflex willingness to politicise national security issues, and particularly to talk about China in a way that I felt was highly politicised”. More coming on this interview very soon. The big foreign news overnight is that US secretary of state Antony Blinken and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov had a stormy meeting on the sidelines of the G20 in India, after which the latter accused the west of blackmail. Australia, meanwhile, has joined other western nations to urge China not to supply arms to Russia to help its war against Ukraine. Penny Wong said the world looked to China “for its responsible leadership when it comes to Ukraine”. More coming on that, too."

                    "bodyText": "We are seeing the worst violence for many years erupting in Gaza and the West Bank. I have just returned from a week in Israel, my first visit since 1994. I spent half the trip with Labour Friends of Israel, a grouping of like-minded Labour MPs, and half with the New Israel Fund, an NGO that funds organisations that promote democracy and equality for all Israelis, based on the vision of Israel’s founders. A packed itinerary enabled me to see what had changed. I have always supported the untrammelled right of Israel to exist and, like many others, have advocated for a two-state solution, ensuring a stable and secure home for Palestinians and Israelis alike. But the two-state solution seems a fantasy at this moment, with little prospect of it developing into a political reality. The tensions are febrile and yet the international community, preoccupied with other crises, is doing little more than expressing concern at the heightened violence. In my humble view, it is simply not pro-Israel, nor pro-Palestinian, to do nothing. There are so many wonderful things about Israel but the deeply anti-democratic proposals being considered by Benjamin Netanyahu’s new extreme rightwing government, alongside a renewed assault on the homes and most basic rights of Palestinians living in the occupied territories, will only deepen division and heighten tensions. They will end the dreams of the postwar idealistic Zionists who sought to build a new Jerusalem in the Middle East. Netanyahu’s government plans to undermine judicial independence by instituting the political appointment of judges and introducing a new “overriding” clause, allowing any decision by the supreme court of Israel to be overridden by a simple majority vote in the Knesset. This would destroy the independence of the judiciary. This is especially damaging because Israel does not have a written constitution and depends on its basic laws, upheld by an independent judiciary, to protect fundamental rights. Israel prides itself on being the only genuine democracy in the region – yet no credible democracy would undermine judicial independence in this way. Netanyahu secured office after the last election by forming a coalition with the extreme right, and rewarding two of its most extremist leaders, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, with jobs – responsible for national security, defence and finance – and a series of damaging proposals are now being developed. There are threats to LGBTQ+ rights; debate about segregating men and women at public events funded by the government; and there are colossal taxes imposed on funds awarded to civil society organisations by a foreign source. This last proposal represents a deliberate attack on those NGOs who work to protect the rights of the most marginalised in Israel. Netanyahu secured his mandate in democratic elections, so many might question the right of others to comment, let alone intervene. But this is a very dangerous moment for Israel that could easily tip into a third intifada. Can we really stand aside? The Jewish Israeli community is completely divided. Massive demonstrations against Netanyahu and his backers are now the order of the day. The parties on the left are in disarray and unable to provide an effective opposition. Negotiations between two dysfunctional forces, the Palestinian Authority and the Netanyahu executive, are impossible. Threats from Iran continue to dominate, and many believe an attack on the Iranian nuclear capability is inevitable. Right now, Israel is in no fit state to navigate a peaceful way forward. Everybody is rightly concerned with security. When visiting an Israeli kibbutz, founded in 1951 by Egyptian Jewish refugees, we were shown around by a third-generation kibbutznik woman. The kibbutz lies so close to the Gaza border that we could hear the call to prayer for Muslims. The kibbutz inhabitants live under constant threat of rocket attacks and we saw the damage done to our guide’s modest home by a nailbomb that struck her reinforced external wall. I also visited Sheikh Jarrah, a deprived neighbourhood in east Jerusalem. I sat in the garden of a 20-strong family of Palestinians, who had also lived in their modest home for three generations and who were now threatened with eviction by Jewish Israelis. The security minister, Ben-Gvir, had erected a small gazebo on a patch of grass in front of this family’s home, claiming it as his office. In fact, it was a provocative assertion of his authority over the area and its inhabitants. Here I also witnessed a weekly demonstration by Jewish Israelis in support of those Palestinians threatened with eviction. The demonstration was disrupted by a group of rightwing Israelis, led by a local councillor with a loudhailer who screamed abuse at the Palestinians and the protesters inches from their faces, with the police just watching on. And yet, amid all this chaos I met wonderful people trying their best to bring the two communities together. A group of doctors who visited different Arab villages every Saturday to provide healthcare; an Arab Israeli professor who ran further education courses both for Arab and Jewish Israelis. But with a broken political landscape and a government focused on measures that can only entrench division and hatred, what can be done? Funding grassroots organisations that work to build confidence between Arabs and Jews from the bottom up is hugely important. However, international pressure, especially from the diaspora Jewish community, to curtail the excesses of the present government, is also needed. And it needs a country outside Israel to actively work to facilitate negotiations between the two warring communities. A two-state solution seems politically impossible for now, but I believe it is historically inevitable. We must play our part in getting there without more unnecessary hatred and bloodshed.

                    "bodyText": "In 1985, the Rainbow Warrior, a Greenpeace ship involved in protests against nuclear testing in the Pacific, sank when it was docked in Auckland, New Zealand. Police and even some crew members initially suspected that something had gone wrong with the boat, but it soon became clear that this was no accident. Over three parts, the gripping Murder in the Pacific tells the story of what happened that night, and what came next. “We’d never had a case like that,” says detective Chris Martin, who was 25 when he received the call to work on the investigation. Despite much of the story taking place almost 40 years ago, this tangled tale of nuclear weapons, geopolitical coverups and attempts to take action against impending environmental collapse is about as current as it is possible to get. With the Doomsday Clock moving closer to midnight, the idea of watching politicians argue that nuclear weapons act as a peacekeeping deterrent may be galling. But alongside the tragedy, both individual and on an international scale, this is a fascinating, pacy history with all the markings of a thriller. It begins by setting up the world of Greenpeace in the 80s and describing its anti-nuclear mission. Bunny McDiarmid was a deck hand who joined Greenpeace while travelling around the US in her 20s. She describes how boats each have a personality, right down to the smells. “She was a really lovely ship,” she remembers of the Rainbow Warrior. Peter Willcox was the skipper. “You couldn’t find a better boat to send a bunch of crazy hippies out on the ocean,” he recalls. Both describe the legacy of decades of nuclear testing in the Pacific, by the Americans and later the French. There is surely some deliberate ambiguity to the documentary title, which refers to the death of the photographer Fernando Pereira on the ship, but arguably to those gravely affected by radioactive contamination in the region, too. Willcox and McDiarmid discuss their role in moving islanders, whose ancestral land on the coral atoll of Rongelap was contaminated by nuclear fallout, to another atoll, after years of suffering from the effects of US nuclear testing. Greenpeace agreed to move, and publicise the plight of, 350 people, along with their housing. “That’s a huge operation,” says Willcox, with some understatement. Pereira was there to photograph it and tell the world what was going on. Director Chloe Campbell has marshalled many of the key players in this saga. As well as those on the Rainbow Warrior, and the police investigating the attack on the ship, there are politicians who present other layers to the story. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, then a Foreign Office minister, argues that Greenpeace’s action could have benefited the Kremlin, suggesting that there could have been a Soviet stooge involved, though he does not know who. Pierre Joxe, the French minister of the interior, argues that nuclear weapons are good for peace. (This feels like a less steady-handed assertion today, as the conflict in Ukraine grinds on.) Lord Heseltine, secretary of state for defence at the time, talks of the “essential” nature of nuclear deterrents back then, due to threats from the USSR. He says that while there was some agreement that Greenpeace had legitimate concerns, its tactics were less palatable to those in power. After Rongelap, these tactics went up another level. According to McDiarmid, the activists’ plan was to stop France testing in French Polynesia by turning themselves into a human shield. They would go into territorial waters, without permission, and get so close to the testing site that the French wouldn’t dare drop bombs, all the while taking photographs of what was going on. This was a military site, but the activists were optimistic, holding a party on the Rainbow Warrior, certain they were ready to “go out and change the world”. History had other ideas. On the night of the party, the ship was rocked by two explosions and Willcox describes watching from the dock as the boat sank, in 40 seconds. This is the first episode of three, and it races through the lead-up to the attack, and the immediate aftermath. It ends on a cliffhanger, which is quite a feat in a film about relatively recent history that many will remember. But this is a very well-made series that taps into historical fears as well as present-day ones, and whenever documentaries are made about eco-activists in an earlier time, you can’t help but feel despair at the fact that these people were ringing the alarm when we were a little less close to the point of no return.

                    "bodyText": "It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner group, has published a video that he said shows his fighters in the key eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. In a post on Telegram, uniformed men are seen lifting a Wagner banner on top of a heavily damaged building. The video has been geolocated to the east of Bakhmut, about 1.2 miles from the city centre, where Wagner fighters have been for a while. A meeting of top diplomats from the Group of 20 (G20) industrialised and developing nations in New Delhi has ended with no consensus on the war in Ukraine. Most G20 members strongly condemned the Ukraine war, with Russia and China disagreeing, said the G20 president, India, after the meeting. India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, said there were “divergences” on the issue of the war in Ukraine “which we could not reconcile as various parties held differing views”. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, spoke for less than 10 minutes on the margins of the G20 meeting in New Delhi today, according to a US state department official. Blinken reiterated to Lavrov that Washington was prepared to support Ukraine’s defence for as long as it took, the official said, in what is believed to be their first one-on-one conversation in person since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Blinken said he told Lavrov that Washington would push for the war in Ukraine to end through diplomatic terms that Kyiv agreed to. Blinken said he had also urged Moscow to reconsider its “irresponsible decision” and return to participation in the New Start nuclear treaty, and that he had also urged Russia to release the detained US citizen Paul Whelan. Ukrainian forces are hanging on to their positions in the ruined eastern city of Bakhmut under constant attack from Russian troops. Russia says seizing Bakhmut would open the way to fully controlling the rest of the strategic Donbas industrial region bordering Russia, one of the main objectives of the invasion it launched on 24 February 2022. Ukraine says Bakhmut has limited strategic value but has put up fierce resistance. “I believe that, sooner or later, we will probably have to leave Bakhmut. There is no sense in holding it at any cost,” the Ukrainian member of parliament Serhiy Rakhmanin said on NV radio late on Wednesday. Russia attacked a five-storey residential block in Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing four people and injuring eight others. The Zaporizhzhia regional military administration said Russia appeared to have used a S-300 missile for the strike. A spokesperson for Russian proxies in the partially occupied region, which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed, said – without producing any evidence – that the strike was the result of the actions of Ukrainian air defences. The Kremlin claimed Russia had been attacked by “terrorists” after conflicting reports of firefights emerged from the Bryansk and Kursk regions, which Russian media blamed on Ukrainian “sabotage groups”. The reports of fighting in Russia near the Ukrainian border began on Thursday morning. The head of the Bryansk region claimed that a “sabotage group opened fire on a moving automobile. As a result, one resident was killed; a 10-year-old child was injured.” In Ukraine, the reports were quickly interpreted as a “false flag” attack launched by Russia to discredit the Ukrainian armed forces. “The story about [the Ukrainian] sabotage group in [Russia] is a classic deliberate provocation,” wrote Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser. There was no immediate video or photo of the fighting to confirm the reports of deaths. Vladimir Putin planned to hold a meeting of the security council, Russia’s main military decision-making body, on Friday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Peskov said he had also cancelled a trip to Stavropol. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has urged China not to send weapons to help Russia’s war in Ukraine, and instead asked Beijing to exert pressure on Moscow to pull back its forces. In a speech to the German parliament, Scholz said it was disappointing that Beijing had refrained from condemning the Russian invasion, though he welcomed its efforts towards nuclear de-escalation. Evidence collected from Kherson in southern Ukraine shows Russian torture centres were not “random” but instead planned and directly financed by the Russian state, according to a team of Ukrainian and international lawyers headed by a UK barrister. The lawyers, called the Mobile Justice Team, said on Thursday they had investigated 20 torture chambers in Kherson and concluded they were part of a “calculated plan to terrorise, subjugate and eliminate Ukrainian resistance and destroy Ukrainian identity”. A new team of nuclear experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have taken up their post at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southern Ukraine after a delay of almost a month, the IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, has said. In a statement, Grossi said the presence of IAEA monitors at the station was “indispensable to help reduce the risk of a nuclear accident”. A Russian regional politician is to appear in court to face accusations that he discredited the armed forces by posting a video of himself listening to a speech by Vladimir Putin with spaghetti draped over his ear. Mikhail Abdalkin, a Communist party lawmaker in the Samara regional parliament, said his case would appear before the Novokuybyshev city court next week. Abdalkin posted his video on “V Kontakte”, Russia’s equivalent of Facebook, shortly after Putin’s state of the nation speech on 21 February. Accompanying the video was a caption saying he had been asked to watch the speech by the deputy chair of the Samara parliament. The video referred to the Russian saying that when noodles have been hung on someone’s ear, that person has been strung along or deceived. “We will fight to prove our non-involvement and innocence,” Abdalkin said. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner group, has published a video that he said shows his fighters in the key eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. In a post on Telegram, uniformed men are seen lifting a Wagner banner on top of a heavily damaged building. One of the men is shown dancing and holding a guitar, a reference to Wagner’s informal nickname of “the musicians”. Prigozhin was quoted by his press service as saying: The lads are mucking about, shooting home video. They brought this from Bakhmut this morning, practically the centre of the city. The video has been geolocated to the east of Bakhmut, about 1.2 miles from the city centre, where Wagner fighters have been for a while. Ukrainian forces were reported to be hanging on to their positions in Bakhmut earlier today, but to be under relentless attacks from Russian forces. Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vučić, has said his country faces “some difficult choices” as he reconsiders its relationship with its traditional Slavic ally, Russia. In an interview with Politico, Vučić indicated that he believed the time had come to rethink Serbia’s refusal to join western sanctions against Russia. He said: You’re going to get one sentence from me: Serbia will remain on its EU path. Okay, draw your own conclusions. But I think you understand me. He added: We’ll have some difficult choices in the future, no doubt. That’s all I can say. Vučić reiterated that Russia should halt its efforts to recruit Serbs to fight alongside its Wagner paramilitary group in Ukraine. The Serbian legislature bans the participation of its citizens in conflicts abroad and several people have been sentenced for doing so. Serbs who have been recruited to fight in Ukraine “are going to be arrested when they come back to Serbia and [are] within reach of our institutions. You don’t recruit like that in a friendly country,” Vučić added. Serbia is a candidate to join the EU, its main trade partner and investor, but it also maintains trade and military cooperation with Russia, a traditional Slavic and Orthodox Christian ally. Although it repeatedly condemned Russia’s invasion against Ukraine at the UN and several other international forums, Belgrade has also refused to impose sanctions against Moscow. A new team of nuclear experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have taken up their post at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southern Ukraine after a delay of almost a month, the IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, has said. The “long-delayed” rotation of IAEA allows the three experts who had been at the site since early January to finally begin their journey back to IAEA headquarters. In a statement, Grossi said the presence of IAEA monitors at the station was “indispensable to help reduce the risk of a nuclear accident”. He added: Our courageous experts – working closely with the plant’s operating staff – are providing technical advice and monitoring the situation in extremely difficult and challenging circumstances. Grossi reiterated his “determination to help protect the plant by agreeing and implementing a nuclear safety and security protection zone there”. Air raid alerts have been reported across Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv. Euan MacDonald of the New Voice of Ukraine has posted a map showing which regions of Ukraine are covered by the air raid alerts, adding that a MiG-31K fighter jet has taken off in Belarus. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he told Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, that Washington would continue to support Ukraine for as long as it took when the pair met briefly on the sidelines of the G20 meeting of foreign ministers in New Delhi. Blinken said he had told Lavrov that Washington would push for the war in Ukraine to end through diplomatic terms that Kyiv agreed to. “End this war of aggression, engage in meaningful diplomacy that can produce a just and durable peace,” Blinken said he had told the Russian foreign minister. He added: President Putin has demonstrated zero interest in engaging, saying there’s nothing to even talk about unless and until Ukraine accepts and I quote ‘the new territorial reality’. Blinken said he had also urged Moscow to reconsider its “irresponsible decision” and return to participation in the New Start nuclear treaty, and that he had told Lavrov that “mutual compliance is in the interest of both our countries”. He added: No matter what else is happening in the world, in our relationship, the United States is always ready to engage and act on strategic arms control, just as the United States and the Soviet Union did even at the height of the cold war. He said he had also urged Russia to release the detained US citizen Paul Whelan, and Washington had “put forward a serious proposal. Russia should take it.” It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A meeting of top diplomats from the Group of 20 (G20) industrialised and developing nations in New Delhi has ended with no consensus on the war in Ukraine.

Copenhagen police said they had attended the scene and recorded “a case of vandalism” and that they were trying to find “traces” in the area. An investigation has been opened into the act, seen as a sign of support for Moscow in the war in Ukraine. Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. In the besieged city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, the volunteers collecting the civilian dead risk becoming casualties themselves. “Where? Where?” demands Daniel Wilk, a Canadian driver, in shaky video footage shot recently inside the city and seen by the Guardian. Wilk proceeds quickly, the anxiety of the situation visible in his movements as he is directed to a fence, cutting an uncertain path across the snow as another voice cries “no, no” repeatedly. The bodies, when Wilk gets to them, have been cut in half by the force of the explosion that took their lives, and still lie where they fell three days before. Quickly they are bundled up in a sheet to be removed. People who have managed to reach Bakhmut in the past week use the same word to describe what they have experienced: hell. As flames and smoke ring into the sky from blazing buildings, the city, almost totally encircled by Russian forces, has been raked by constant gunfire and explosions in recent days. With roads leading to the city under constant fire from two sides, and with snipers in the streets, accessing the city has become ever more perilous for rescue teams, as speculation has mounted that Ukrainian forces will have to withdraw. “We haven’t been able to reach the downtown area in recent days,” said Olha Danilova, who like Wilk works for a Ukrainian NGO, Dobryi Rukh, which has been working in Bakhmut for all of the seven months of the Russian assault. The closest we could get was 500 metres from the city centre. It’s very loud. Everything is being shelled with mortars. It’s inaccessible. We were trying evacuate civilian from down by the river last time. We couldn’t even get close. The main road we used to use is being shelled constantly. The 27th [of February] was the worst. That was the hell day. It was the hardest day we’ve had since we’ve been working here. It was a wall of fire. Two walls of fire. It was coming from all sides, and aviation was attacking. Read the full report by Peter Beaumont: Poland and Ukraine have called for international sanctions against Russia’s nuclear energy sector, after the EU adopted its latest package of sanctions that did not include Moscow’s nuclear energy sector because of opposition from some EU member states. “If we want to develop nuclear … we need to suspend Russia in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),” Poland’s climate and environment minister, Anna Moskwa, said at an energy conference in the Croatian capital of Zagreb. We need to end any nuclear cooperation with Russia … and I believe Europe will manage to do so. Nuclear sanctions next package – this is our future challenge we need to face no matter how difficult it is. She said Russia’s occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power in southern Ukraine was a “very huge danger to our economies, to our society, to our security”. “We should get rid of Russians in the nuclear sector, in a civilised world they cannot be present as a partner of business,” Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said at the same conference. He added: They destroy everything, they destroy all seven pillars of nuclear safety and security. Reuters has a quick snap from the sidelines of the G20 meeting that US secretary of state Antony Blinken claims to have told Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov that whatever else was happening in the world, the US was always ready to engage with Russia on the issue of strategic arms control. Blinken and Lavrov met briefly in New Delhi, according to US officials, in what would have been their first face-to-face meeting since Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine commenced in February 2022. Last Tuesday, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, said his country would halt its participation in the New Start nuclear arms treaty. Moldova’s parliament adopted a declaration on Thursday condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine which has contributed to a rise in tensions between Moscow and Chișinău. A narrow majority of 55 lawmakers in the 101-seat assembly voted for the declaration, which stated that Moscow’s invasion began with the seizure of the Crimea peninsula in February 2014 and demanded the withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukraine. Reuters reports the declaration said Russia was waging an illegal, unprovoked and unfounded war of aggression in Ukraine that violated the principles of international law, and echoed calls by Kyiv for an international tribunal to prosecute war crimes. Tensions between Russia and Moldova, the small former Soviet republic which borders Ukraine, have grown sharply since the war began. Moldova has protested to Moscow that Russian missiles aimed at Ukraine have entered its airspace and that missile debris has landed inside its borders, and it has accused Moscow of plotting to topple the pro-European government in Chișinău. Russia has denied the allegation and accused Ukraine and other countries of stoking instability in Moldova’s breakaway Transdniestria region, where about 1,500 Russian troops are based. Chișinău and Kyiv have dismissed the accusation. The Guardian’s Peter Beaumont reports seeing an increase in the number of people claiming that images from Ukraine are fake. He writes that it is his fifth trip to Ukraine and his sense of outrage is only getting stronger. “Listen to the people who are here,” he adds. In Ukraine, the reports of firefights emerged from the Bryansk and Kursk regions were quickly interpreted as a “false flag” attack launched by Russia to discredit the Ukrainian armed forces. “The story about [the Ukrainian] sabotage group in [Russia] is a classic deliberate provocation,” wrote Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser. [Russia] wants to scare its people to justify the attack on another country and the growing poverty after the year of war. The partisan movement in [Russia] is getting stronger and more aggressive. Fear your partisans … The Kremlin claimed Russia had been attacked by “terrorists” after conflicting reports of fighting emerged from the Bryansk and Kursk regions, which Russian media blamed on Ukrainian “sabotage groups” and Ukrainian sources called a “provocation”. The reports of fighting in Russia near the Ukrainian border began on Thursday morning. The head of the Bryansk region claimed that a “sabotage group opened fire on a moving automobile. As a result, one resident was killed; a 10-year-old child was injured.” Other reports of hostages being taken or school buses being fired upon have been discredited, even by local Russian officials. In an online statement later corroborated by the independent Russian news site iStories, a group called the Russian Volunteer Corps claimed its fighters had crossed the border into Russia on Thursday but denied reports of civilian casualties. The reports of the attack set off a flurry of activity in the Kremlin and at Russia’s security services. Russia’s FSB security service claimed it had launched an operation “to destroy armed Ukrainian nationalists who violated the state border”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the president, Vladimir Putin, would plan to hold a meeting of the security council, Russia’s main military decision-making body, on Friday. Peskov said he had also cancelled a trip to Stavropol. He said: We are talking about a terrorist attack. Measures are being taken to eliminate them. Asked whether Russia could change the status of its “special military operation” after the reported attacks, Peskov said: I don’t know. I can’t say for now. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has been pictured in New Delhi where he is attending a meeting of top diplomats from the G20 countries. A meeting of top diplomats from the Group of 20 (G20) industrialised and developing nations in New Delhi has ended with no consensus on the war in Ukraine. Most G20 members strongly condemned the Ukraine war, with Russia and China disagreeing, said the G20 president, India, after the meeting. India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, said there were “divergences” on the issue of the war in Ukraine “which we could not reconcile as various parties held differing views”. He said: If we had a perfect meeting of minds on all issues, it would have been a collective statement. Much of the talks were dominated by discussions of the war and China’s widening global influence, he said, adding that members agreed on most issues involving the concerns of less-developed nations, “like strengthening multilateralism, promoting food and energy security, climate change, gender issues and counter-terrorism”. The Little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen, one of Denmark’s most notable landmarks, has been vandalised with a Russian flag painted across its base. The colours of the white, blue and red ensign were on Thursday found daubed on the rock on which the statue of the heroine from Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytale rests. Copenhagen police said they had attended the scene and recorded “a case of vandalism” and that they were trying to find “traces” in the area. An investigation has been opened into the act, seen as a sign of support for Moscow in the war in Ukraine. Read the full story here: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, spoke for less than 10 minutes on the margins of the G20 meeting in New Delhi today, according to a US state department official. Blinken reiterated to Lavrov that Washington was prepared to support Ukraine’s defence for as long as it takes, the official said, in what is believed to be their first one-on-one conversation in person since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Blinken also called for Moscow to reverse its decision to suspend participation in the New Start nuclear treaty and to release detained US citizen, Paul Whelan. The official said: The secretary saw the purpose of this was to deliver these three direct messages, which we see as advancing our interests. We always remain hopeful that the Russians will reverse their decision and be prepared to engage in a diplomatic process that can lead to a just and durable peace, but I wouldn’t say that coming out of this encounter there was any expectation that things will change in the near term. Lavrov did not mention the meeting during a news conference he gave after Thursday’s G20 foreign ministers’ meeting. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, confirmed the meeting took place, telling CNN: Blinken asked for contact with Lavrov. On the go, as part of the second session of the [G20], Sergey Viktorovich [Lavrov] talked. There were no negotiations, meetings, etc. Boris Johnson is delivering the keynote address at London’s soft power summit, where he says democracy matters because Vladimir Putin would never have made “the catastrophic mistake of invading Ukraine”. Putin would “never have been so deluded about the true nature” of Ukraine if Russians lived in a free society with free media. [Putin] would have known that the Ukrainians are a great patriotic people and that they would fight for every inch of their land. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has been speaking at a soft power summit in London, where he was asked by the journalist Mishal Husain about the “striking difference” in polls that showed support for Ukraine between western countries and countries such as India and Turkey. Kuleba said there was a broad notion that the countries in the Global South was against Ukraine, but the reality was far more nuanced. He said there were three rules that he used in communicating with countries: First, he had “to speak with them. The more you speak, the more familiar they get with the issue.” The second was that he had to address them “with a lot of respect. Most of these countries are traumatised with their own history.” Finally, what really worked was “putting them in our shoes”, he said. What really works is just to say, are you ready to concede a square kilometre of your own country to your neighbour, simply because your neighbour decided to take the square kilometre away from you? The answer is always no. Here are some of the latest images from the scene of a Russian missile strike on a residential building in Zaporizhzhia in south-east Ukraine. At least four people have been killed and eight wounded in the attack, Ukrainian officials said. Russia has violated the world’s very principle of soft power, Olena Zelenska has said, and the world must decide “whether the language of aggression is acceptable to them”. Russia attacked not only Ukraine but all world principles of peaceful coexistence, human rights and the progress we have made. Why negotiate when you can launch missiles? Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, is delivering a video address at a soft power summit in London. The country’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, and the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson are also expected to speak. You can watch live here: Ukrainian forces hung on to their positions in the ruined eastern city of Bakhmut early on Thursday under constant attack from Russian troops seeking to claim their first major victory for more than half a year. Russia says seizing Bakhmut would open the way to fully controlling the rest of the strategic Donbas industrial region bordering Russia, one of the main objectives of the invasion it launched on 24 February 2022. Ukraine says Bakhmut has limited strategic value but has put up fierce resistance. Not everyone in Ukraine is convinced that defending Bakhmut can go on indefinitely. “I believe that sooner or later, we will probably have to leave Bakhmut. There is no sense in holding it at any cost,” the Ukrainian member of parliament Serhiy Rakhmanin said on NV radio late on Wednesday. Russia attacked a five-storey residential block in Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing three people and injuring six others. Rescuers are searching for survivors under the rubble. One of the people evacuated from the building was a pregnant woman. The building was “almost completely destroyed”, the city’s acting mayor, Anatoly Kurtev, said. The Zaporizhzhia regional military administration said Russia appeared to have used a S-300 missile for the strike. A spokesperson for Russian proxies in the partially occupied region which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed said – without producing any evidence – that the strike was the result of the actions of Ukrainian air defences. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has cancelled a planned trip to Stavropol amid reports of a Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s Bryansk region. Russian media has reported that two villages near the border with Ukraine have been attacked, with at least one person killed. Details remain unclear, but the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described the incident as a “terrorist” attack. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Thursday urged China not to send weapons to help Russia’s war in Ukraine, and instead asked Beijing to exert pressure on Moscow to pull back its forces. In a speech to the German parliament, Reuters reports that Scholz said it was disappointing that Beijing had refrained from condemning the Russian invasion, though he welcomed its efforts towards nuclear de-escalation. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, accused Moscow of repressing domestic critics and called on UN-mandated investigators to keep documenting Russia’s alleged abuses in the Ukraine war, in a speech to the Human Rights Council. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, called on Thursday for the G20 to bridge differences over Ukraine, telling the opening of a meeting in New Delhi that global governance has “failed”. “The experience of the last few years – financial crisis, climate change, pandemic, terrorism and wars – clearly shows that global governance has failed,” Modi said in a recorded statement, opening the meeting of G20 foreign ministers. Russia’s foreign minister said on Thursday that many leaders from the west had turned the agenda of a G20 meeting in India “into a farce”. Sergei Lavrov told a meeting of G20 foreign ministers in New Delhi “a number of western delegations has turned the work on the G20 agenda into a farce, wanting to shift the responsibility for their failures in the economy to the Russian federation”. Blinken, meanwhile, said: “Unfortunately, this meeting has again been marred by Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine.” Lavrov accused the west of “shamelessly burying” the Black Sea grain initiative that facilitates the export of Ukraine’s agricultural products from its southern ports. Ukraine has said that it would like to renew the deal for a period of at least a year to provide certainty to exporters, and to expand it to include the port of Mykolaiv. Ukraine’s state broadcaster, Suspilne, has reported on its Telegram channel that the water supply in Mykolaiv will be off Thursday between 11am and 5pm due to a shutdown at the pumping station. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Russian media outlets have been carrying reports claiming that Ukrainian forces entered Russian territory in Bryansk region, which borders northern Ukraine. Tass reports that head of the region, Alexander Bogomaz, gave the news, and that “according to the latest information, they entered two villages, there is a battle going on”. Details remain unclear, but Tass also reports: “The security forces confirmed that an operation is being carried out in the border area to destroy violators of the state border.” The state-owned RIA Novosti news agency reported on its Telegram channel that the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, in his daily media breifing, said that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, cancelled a planned trip to Stavropol “due to the situation in the Bryansk region”. In his media briefing, Peskov said the incident had been an attack by “terrorists”. Tass suggests that “saboteurs attacked both Lyubechan and Sushany”, and that “Ukrainian forces fired at a vehicle, killing one person and injuring another, a 10-year-old child”. It reports: “The FSB confirmed to TASS that in the border area of the Bryansk region ‘measures are being taken to destroy the armed Ukrainian nationalists who have violated the state border.’” The claims have not been independently verified. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, accused Moscow of repressing domestic critics and called on UN-mandated investigators to keep documenting Russia’s alleged abuses in the Ukraine war, in a speech to the Human Rights Council on Thursday. Blinken described Russia’s civil society crackdown as a “systematic muzzling” and said UN investigators should continue documenting Russia’s Ukraine abuses to provide “an impartial record of what’s occurring, and a foundation for national and international efforts to hold perpetrators accountable”. Reuters reports his video address comes ahead of an expected speech by a senior Russian official, Sergei Ryabkov, who is due to appear before the same Geneva-based body for the first time since Moscow invaded Ukraine more than a year ago. Kateryna Mishchenko is a Ukrainian author, and this morning we have an adapted text of her closing address at Debates on Europe 2023 in which she asks: does Europe want Ukrainians as living partners or dead heroes? Even before Russia’s full-scale invasion, I often heard people refer to Ukraine as Europe’s back yard. Now it resembles a graveyard, the war itself a gravedigger – missiles and shells form huge pits, digging graves for Ukrainians themselves. This cemetery is planted with beautiful flowers – notions of unbreakability, courage and resilience, which should give hope, the promise of rebuilding and that life is possible after all the horror. A few weeks ago, I crossed the border between Ukraine and the European Union. Today there are no fast connections to or from Ukraine. The long journey has its own logic: the mental transformation takes time. In order to move from peace to war or from war to peace, one has to travel through a process, out of accelerated time – where the countdown applies not to seconds, but to human lives – into a time where there is room for reflection and discussion (sometimes just the wasting of words) and, most importantly, where there is time for choice. This mental metamorphosis creates anxiety, fear, disrupts sleep and deprives you of the most basic confidence in the ground under your feet, even when this ground is no longer dug up by shells and grave shovels. The borderline is felt as a kind of mental disorder. Perhaps the current Nato strategy of supporting Ukraine in doses can be viewed through the prism of the fatal political logic of the borderline. The repressed can wait. But for how long? Read more here: Kateryna Mishchenko – Does Europe want Ukrainians as living partners or dead heroes? Guardian journalist Peter Beaumont is driving from Kharkiv to Kramatorsk to cover the situation around Bakhmut. He has this to say about the car journey. We’ve been in Kupiansk for the last two days which has seen increasing shell fire from Russian artillery. We saw a lot of damage there, but coming south past Izium there are villages and towns that have been smashed to pieces. Extraordinary damage. We stopped in one place, where every building was damaged, some reduced to rubble, including what appeared to be a monastery or church. All along this section of the road there are mine warning signs. At one point we were surprised by an explosion ahead of us, a puff of grey smoke above the road. We could see soldiers who seemed unconcerned, so came closer and could see they were blowing up unexploded ordinance right by the road. Russia’s foreign minister said on Thursday that many leaders from the west had turned the agenda of a G20 meeting in India “into a farce”, the Tass news agency reported. “A number of western delegations has turned the work on the G20 agenda into a farce, wanting to shift the responsibility for their failures in the economy to the Russian federation,” Sergei Lavrov told a meeting of G20 foreign ministers in New Delhi. Meanwhile, US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said the G20 meeting has been marred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Unfortunately, this meeting has again been marred by Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine,” Reuters report Blinken said, adding that G20 countries must continue to call on Russia to withdraw from Ukraine. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne has reported on its Telegram channel that the water supply in Mykolaiv will be off today between 11am and 5pm due to a shutdown at the pumping station. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Thursday urged China not to send weapons to help Russia’s war in Ukraine, and instead asked Beijing to exert pressure on Moscow to pull back its forces. In a speech to the German parliament, Reuters reports that Scholz said it was disappointing that Beijing had refrained from condemning the Russian invasion, though he welcomed its efforts towards nuclear de-escalation. “My message to Beijing is clear: use your influence in Moscow to urge the withdrawal of Russian troops,” he said. “And don’t deliver any weapons to the aggressor Russia.” Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday accused the west of “shamelessly burying” the Black Sea grain initiative that facilitates the export of Ukraine’s agricultural products from its southern ports, the RIA Novosti news agency reported. Reuters notes that while remaining in the agreement, Russia has repeatedly complained about the west’s approach to the deal, struck last July, saying countries that have imposed sanctions on Moscow were not doing enough to ease restrictions on Russia’s own exports, in particular of fertilisers. Ukraine has said that it would like to renew the deal for a period of at least a year, to provide certainty to exporters, and to expand it to include the port of Mykolaiv. German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, met with her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, before the G20 meeting in India, the German foreign ministry said on Twitter on Thursday. “In the face of Russia’s brutal attack on Ukraine and the UN Charter, neutrality rewards the aggressor,” Reuters reports the ministry added in the tweet. The G20 meeting has been accompanied by an awkward set of bilateral meetings overshadowed by disagreements over the war in Ukraine, with some of the attenders pointedly not expected to meet face-to-face on the sidelines as might usually be expected. Suspilne, Ukraine’s national brodcaster, has raised the death toll from the strike on a residential building in Zaporizhzhia to three. It reports on Telegram: Three people were killed as a result of a Russian missile attack on a five-story building in Zaporizhzhia at night, the national police reported. Six injured were hospitalised, rescuers continue to work on the spot. Ukraine’s emergency services have released images from the scene of a missile strike on a residential building in Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine’s state broadcaster has reported that two people were killed, and that people were believed to be trapped under the rubble. In quotes being carried by Russian state-owned media, Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-proxy who is chair of the We Are Together with Russia organisation that operates within the occupied Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine, has claimed on Telegram, without providing evidence, that the blast was a result of Ukrainian air defence fire. He is quoted as saying: The work of the Ukrainian military over my native Zaporizhzhia led to the destruction of an apartment building and casualties among peaceful, innocent people. Today, at about 2.45am, two explosions sounded in the regional centre, temporarily occupied by the regime of Zelenskiy. According to Tass, Rogov went on to say that the armed forces of Ukraine are constantly firing anti-aircraft missiles over residential areas, not taking into account the security of the civilian population. Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and Zaporizhzhia is one of the partially occupied areas of the country which the Russian Federation claimed to annex late last year. Olena Zelenska, Ukraine’s first lady, has tweeted about the overnight attack on Zaporizhzhia, writing: Zaporizhzhia bravely resists the Russian aggressor. In retaliation, it attacks civilians. A high-rise building was deliberately hit last night. Three floors are completely destroyed. People died. We continue to search under the rubble. My condolences to the victims. We will not forgive this. Europe’s chief prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi has told Agence France-Presse she wants to go after people undermining sanctions against Russia. The European public prosecutor’s office is charged with probing any offence deemed to have cost the EU money, which often means tracking international crime gangs and sophisticated cross-border VAT fraud operations. The EU has imposed a series of ten packages of economic sanctions on Moscow as punishment for its year-old invasion of Ukraine, and the 49-year-old anti-graft champion wants to go after the gangs circumventing the measures to supply Russia’s war machine. “This is something that we already have been asked by the Commission – if we can deal with it. And our answer was: ‘Yes, we can do it. We are ready to do it’,” she said. “We have specialised prosecutors. We have offices in 22 member states … We are the only available tool in this moment at the European level that can fight with this kind of criminality.” Any decision to add sanctions-busters to the EPPO’s targets would be a political one, taken by the leaders of the EU member states. Not all have been supportive of her role – Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, Poland and Ireland have assigned no prosecutors to the EPPO. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for now. My colleague Martin will take you through the rest of the day’s news. The UK Ministry of Defence has published a wartime weather forecast in its update today, predicting that “warmer than average conditions for the remainder of winter and spring”. While this is good news for people trying to stay warm, it will pose a challenge to Ukraine’s armed forces as the ground thaws, creating mud. Poor cross-country movement (CCM) caused by mud does “provide some advantage to defending forces”, the ministry said – presumably by slowing the attackers down. It added that, “It is almost certain that by late March, CCM will be at its worst after the final thaw. This will add further friction to ground operations and hamper the off-road movement of heavier armoured vehicles, especially over churned-up ground in the Bakhmut sector.” The G20 will see US secretary of state Antony Blinken and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in the same room for the first time since July, but the two men are unlikely to hold talks, AFP reports. Western delegates fear China is considering supplying arms to its Russian ally and they will use the foreign ministers’ summit to discourage Beijing from intervening in the conflict. India’s longstanding security ties with Russia have put the host of Thursday’s meeting in an awkward diplomatic position after refusing to condemn the invasion over the past year. But EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he was confident India would use the meeting to “make Russia understand that this war has to finish”. “Certainly the success of the meeting today will be measured in respect to what we will be able to do on that,” he told reporters Wednesday. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi called Thursday for the G20 to bridge differences over Ukraine, telling the opening of a meeting in New Delhi that global governance has “failed”. “The experience of the last few years – financial crisis, climate change, pandemic, terrorism and wars – clearly shows that global governance has failed,” Modi said in a recorded statement opening the meeting of G20 foreign ministers. “We are meeting at a time of deep global divisions … We all have our positions and our perspectives on how these tensions [can] be resolved. However, as the leading economies of the world, we also have a responsibility for those who are not in this room,” Modi said. India had wanted its G20 presidency this year to focus on issues such as alleviating poverty and climate finance, but the Ukraine war has so far crowded out other agenda items. Ukrainian forces hung on to their positions in the ruined eastern city of Bakhmut early on Thursday under constant attack from Russian troops seeking to claim their first major victory for more than half a year. Russia says seizing Bakhmut would open the way to fully controlling the rest of the strategic Donbas industrial region bordering Russia, one of the main objectives of its invasion a year ago on 24 February. Ukraine says Bakhmut has limited strategic value but has nevertheless put up fierce resistance. Not everyone in Ukraine is convinced that defending Bakhmut can go on indefinitely. “I believe that sooner or later, we will probably have to leave Bakhmut. There is no sense in holding it at any cost,” Ukrainian member of parliament Serhiy Rakhmanin said on NV radio late on Wednesday. “But for the moment, Bakhmut will be defended with several aims - firstly, to inflict as many Russian losses as possible and make Russia use its ammunition and resources.” No lines of defence should be allowed to collapse, Rakhmanin said. “There are two ways to approach this - an organised retreat or simple flight. And we cannot allow flight to take place under any circumstances,” he said. Among the people evacuated from the apartment block was a pregnant woman, photographs show. A Reuters photographer captured this photo of a Zaporizhzhia resident named Yurji holding the hand of his relative, Anna, who was in the apartment block when it was hit by a Russian missile. Russia attacked a five-storey apartment block in Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing two people, the city’s acting mayor, Anatoly Kurtev, said. Rescuers are searching for survivors under the rubble. The building was “almost completely destroyed”, Kurtev said. The Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration said Russia appears to have used a S-300 missile. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next while. Russia attacked a five-storey apartment block in Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing two people, the city’s acting mayor, Anatoly Kurtev, said. Rescuers are searching for survivors under the rubble. And Ukrainian forces hung on to their positions in the ruined eastern city of Bakhmut early on Thursday under constant attack from Russian troops seeking to claim their first major victory for more than half a year. “I believe that sooner or later, we will probably have to leave Bakhmut. There is no sense in holding it at any cost,” Ukrainian member of parliament Serhiy Rakhmanin said on NV radio late on Wednesday. “But for the moment, Bakhmut will be defended with several aims – firstly, to inflict as many Russian losses as possible and make Russia use its ammunition and resources.” We’ll have more on these stories shortly. First, here are the other key recent developments: Ukrainians survived the past winter thanks to government efforts to ensure energy and heat, but Russia still poses a threat to the generating system, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. “Winter is over. It was a very difficult one and every Ukrainian, without exaggeration, felt the difficulties,” the Ukrainian president said in a video message delivered after a meeting on energy issues. “But we managed to provide Ukraine with energy and heat. The threat to the energy system remains.” Russia has lost at least 130 tanks and armoured personnel carriers in a three-week battle at the town of Vuhledar in southern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials. They said the “epic” fight on a plain near Vuhledar produced the biggest tank battle of the war so far and a stinging setback for the Russians, the New York Times reported. The United States is sounding out close allies about the possibility of imposing new sanctions on China if Beijing provides military support to Russia for its war in Ukraine, according to four US officials and other sources. The consultations, which are still at a preliminary stage, are intended to drum up support from a range of countries, especially those in the wealthy G7, to coordinate support for any possible restrictions. The Ukrainian military may decide to withdraw its forces from Bakhmut, an economic adviser to Zelenskiy has said. “Our military is obviously going to weigh all of the options. So far, they’ve held the city, but if need be, they will strategically pull back,” said Alexander Rodnyansky on CNN. “We’re not going to sacrifice all of our people just for nothing.” Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, said Ukrainian forces were putting up “furious resistance” against Moscow’s attempt to seize Bakhmut. Prigozhin said he so far had seen no signs of a Ukrainian withdrawal. The battle for Bakhmut, in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance as defenders hold out against relentless shelling and repel waves of Russian troops who have been carrying out a months-long campaign to capture it. Russia’s defence ministry has said its forces repelled what it described as a major Ukrainian drone attack on Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014. “Six Ukrainian attack drones were shot down by air defence systems. Another four Ukrainian drones were disabled by electronic warfare,” the ministry said. Vladimir Putin has said he is preparing for a visit to Moscow by China’s president, Xi Jinping, Russian state media reported. The Russian leader said he planned to show the Chinese delegation the Moscow metro’s Bolshaya Koltsevaya line (Big Circle line) during their visit to the Russian capital. The leaders of China and Belarus – Xi Jinping and Alexander Lukashenko – have issued a joint statement calling for a ceasefire in Ukraine and negotiations to bring about a political settlement. The joint call amounted to an endorsement of Beijing’s peace plan issued last week that called for respect of national sovereignty and “territorial integrity”. Finland’s parliament has overwhelmingly approved joining Nato. Finnish MPs voted 184 in favour of accepting the Nato treaties, with seven against and one abstaining, increasing the chances of it becoming a member of the transatlantic defensive alliance before its neighbour Sweden. Hungary’s president, Katalin Novák, urged lawmakers on Wednesday to ratify Finland and Sweden’s Nato entry “as soon as possible”. “It is a complex decision, with serious consequences, so careful consideration is necessary,” Novák said on Facebook. Germany will ramp up ammunition production as well as ensure it has enough replacement parts and repairs capacity in its defence industry to better support Ukraine, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said. Russia would only agree to extend the Black Sea grain deal if the interests of its agricultural producers were taken into account, Russia’s foreign ministry has said. The deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey, allows safe exports from Ukrainian ports and is up for renewal this month. Russia brought new legal amendments to parliament on Wednesday that further strengthen the country’s censorship laws, envisaging up to 15 years in jail for discrediting the armed forces or voluntary military organisations such as the Wagner group."

The Kremlin claimed Russia had been attacked by “terrorists” after conflicting reports of firefights emerged from the Bryansk and Kursk regions, which Russian media blamed on Ukrainian “sabotage groups” and Ukrainian sources called a “provocation”. The reports of fighting in Russia near the Ukrainian border began on Thursday morning. The head of the Bryansk region claimed that a “sabotage group opened fire on a moving automobile. As a result, one resident was killed; a 10-year-old child was injured”. The reports of the attack set off a flurry of activity in the Kremlin and at Russia’s security services. Russia’s FSB security service claimed it had launched an operation “to destroy armed Ukrainian nationalists who violated the state border”.

Nevertheless, Blinken and Lavrov spoke for ten minutes on the margins of the G20 meeting, according to a US state department official, in what is believed to be their first one-on-one conversation in person since Russia’s invasion. Moldova’s parliament adopted a declaration on Thursday condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine which has contributed to a rise in tensions between Moscow and Chișinău. A narrow majority of 55 lawmakers in the 101-seat assembly voted for the declaration, which stated that Moscow’s invasion began with the seizure of the Crimea peninsula in February 2014 and demanded the withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukraine. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne has reported on its Telegram channel that the water supply in Mykolaiv will be off Thursday between 11am and 5pm due to a shutdown at the pumping station. The Little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen, one of Denmark’s most notable landmarks, has been vandalised with a Russian flag painted across its base. The colours of the red, white and blue ensign were daubed overnight on Thursday on the rock on which the statue of the heroine from Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytale rests.

                    "bodyText": "And with that, we are going to put the blog to bed – before we go, let’s recap the big headlines from today: The former Coalition minister Stuart Robert told the robodebt inquiry he made false statements about the scheme in TV interviews because it was “the approach that cabinet had signed off”. Richard Marles has taken aim at Peter Dutton for his pre-emptive criticism of the possible Aukus announcement. The federal government received another review into disturbing allegations of sexual harassment and cultural problems on remote Antarctic stations, which includes “substantial” recommendations for change. Mediation has failed to resolve the legal dispute between Monique Ryan, Sally Rugg and the commonwealth, which employs parliamentary staff. Sticky Fingers have been taken off the 2023 Bluesfest lineup, after weeks of backlash over their place on the bill. Australia backing Vanuatu in international court climate bid From AAP: Australia is supporting Vanuatu’s bid to have a top international court outline what responsibilities countries have to act on the climate crisis. The Pacific island nation is one of the most susceptible to global heating and has asked the International Court of Justice to issue an advisory opinion on the issue. More than 100 nations including Britain and New Zealand on top of a raft of European, Scandinavian, Southeast Asian and Pacific nations co-sponsored the move. But some of the world’s largest emitters including the United States, China and India haven’t agreed to sponsor the push, which will come to a vote at the United Nations later in the year. Any advisory opinion from the Hague-based court would be non-binding. The Australian government has outlined climate crisis as an urgent challenge and the greatest threat to Pacific nations and security in the region. La Perouse site declared an Aboriginal place by NSW government From AAP: A former Aboriginal mission that has become a crucial place for Indigenous activism and resistance will be formally recognised in cultural laws. Aboriginal families have lived at the La Perouse site south of Sydney for more than 7500 years. The Frenchmans Bay location has a long and troubled history of oppression and dispossession, dating back the late 1800s when Aboriginal people were forced out of the city, with many moving to La Perouse. The site became a camping and meeting place, and then Sydney’s first Aboriginal reserve from the 1890s to 1930s. The site has now been declared an Aboriginal place by the NSW government. Sam Kidman from Heritage NSW said it was a testament to the great resilience of Indigenous people. “It is a very special place of ancient history and ongoing cultural practices that we’re acknowledging for its cultural significance, and to help protect it for future generations,” he said. Warning issued against swimming in WA’s Fitzroy River People are being urged not to swim across the flooded Fitzroy River after two men drowned while trying to reach the other side of town, AAP has reported. The body of a 20-year-old man was recovered on Monday after he entered the water near the Fitzroy River Lodge in Western Australia’s north. Another man, aged 40, was found drowned in the river on 10 February. Fitzroy Crossing was split by once-in-a-century floods in January which destroyed dozens of homes and collapsed the town’s bridge. Repair efforts across the Kimberley region have been hampered by continued heavy rain with weeks still left to run in the wet season. The full rebuild of the Fitzroy Crossing bridge is expected to take years and the state emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, says it’s not feasible to build a walkway under the conditions. Jason Clare highlights international links in address to Delhi students Ten new memorandums of understanding will be signed between Indian and Australian institutions on Friday, education minister Jason Clare has announced. Speaking to students at Delhi University on his delegation to India, Clare hypothesised moving through time. He said if you “got in a time machine and went back 50 years” only 7% of Australians had a university degree. Today, almost one in two young Australians do. We are a different country. Then minister Pradhan took me in his time machine – set to 2035. Twelve years into the future. By then the Indian government plans to have half of its young people in vocational and higher education. That is nation-changing stuff. He said Australia had heard the call from India to be a part of its higher education plan. Some already offer courses at Indian universities. Some want to set up campuses. Some are setting up offices. Some are here to sign agreements. All want to learn, want to help and want to be part of this bigger, deeper partnership in India. We’re building on what is already a very close relationship. Right now, there are around 70,000 Indian students studying in Australia, mostly in higher education and vocational training. In the past 17 years more than one and a half million Indian students have studied in Australia. More than 1,700 of our university lecturers and tutors have Indian ancestry. Right here, Delhi University has memoranda of understanding with three Australian universities – Macquarie University, the University of Wollongong and the University of Melbourne. Tomorrow 10 new memoranda will be signed between Indian and Australian institutions. Thinktanks reports Australia a leader in key technology fields A new report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says China is winning the race against the United States to develop advanced technologies and retain talent. But beyond the headline findings, the research team also found that Australia was amongst the top-five countries for nine technologies. These included cyber security, critical minerals extraction and processing, electric batteries, hydrogen and ammonia power, novel metamaterials, distributed ledgers (such as blockchains) and 3D printing. Australia was “well-placed to make lithium batteries and other products that can build local industries and help strengthen the nation’s energy security”, the report said. Monique Ryan rejects Sally Rugg’s claims Monique Ryan has responded to the announcement from Maurice Blackburn this afternoon that mediation between herself and Sally Rugg has failed: Ms Rugg recently launched legal proceedings against the Commonwealth and against me. This matter is before the court, and I will not be commenting on it at this point. Her claims, and the additional matters raised in Maurice Blackburn’s press release of 2.3.2023, are rejected and will be defended. Safe Work Australia opens public consultation on engineered stone ban Safe Work Australia CEO Michelle Baxter: I welcome the decision by WHS ministers to agree to Safe Work Australia’s recommendations on action to reduce workplace exposure to respirable crystalline silica and prevent silicosis and silica-related diseases in Australia. Workplace exposure to respirable crystalline silica has led to an unacceptable increase in the number of cases of silicosis and other silica-related diseases. Today, Safe Work Australia commenced the next stage of consultation on a prohibition on the use of engineered stone. Consultation is open through Safe Work Australia’s Engage website until 2 April 2023. Stakeholder feedback from the consultation will inform a report to be provided to WHS ministers for their consideration. We will also work closely with WHS regulators and other stakeholders including industry and unions, to implement the options agreed by WHS ministers, including further national awareness and behaviour-change initiatives and regulation of high-risk crystalline silica processes for all materials, including engineered stone, and across all industries. I encourage all stakeholders to go to Safe Work Australia’s consultation website Engage to take part and have your say on a prohibition on the use of engineered stone. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, has taken aim at the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, for his pre-emptive criticism of the possible Aukus announcement. At some point this month, Australia, the UK and the US are due to announce their plans for Australia’s acquisition of at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. Yesterday and today, Dutton continued to argue the US Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines would be the best choice for Australia, rather than a British model in development. Marles told ABC TV the former Coalition government had presided over a “lost decade” in terms of procuring a replacement for Australia’s existing diesel-electric Collins class submarines. Marles added: I’m limited in what I can say. We are at a point where it won’t be long before we are making the announcement about what the optimal pathway will look like. The opposition leader is obviously giving comments based on confidential advice he was provided almost a year ago. A lot of water has gone under the bridge since then. We’re mindful of the issues that have been raised but people need to wait and see what is announced. Asked whether he was worried Dutton’s comments may have unsettled Australia’s Aukus partners, Marles said: Look, I think it is really important that there is bipartisanship. I’m confident obviously that our partners in the United Kingdom and the United States are completely sure about where we stand on this and know that there is full government support in relation to it. They would obviously understand that the former government initiated the [Aukus] process and I do accept what the leader of the opposition has said that the opposition will provide support to whatever we announce in the near term. But I’m not sure that speculation of this kind helps right now. We are really very much on the verge of an announcement. And I think what matters now is, when that announcement is made, making sure that that enjoys the support of the full spectrum of politics in Australia. Marles said the government would ensure the opposition was “appropriately briefed in respect of the announcement” but added that Australia had “obligations to our partners” in the US and the UK. Mediation has failed to resolve the legal dispute between Sally Rugg and Monique Ryan, Rugg’s lawyers have announced. In a statement Maurice Blackburn Lawyers Principal Josh Bornstein said: Ms Rugg will seek to add claims of “serious contraventions” of the Fair Work Act against the Commonwealth. A serious contravention occurs where the breach of labour standards is knowing and systematic. The penalty for serious contraventions is a maximum of $660,000.00.” Ms Rugg’s claim is expected to include comments made by Dr Ryan. Mr Bornstein said “ Dr Ryan publicly acknowledged that her staff were working 70-hour weeks and that it was not safe. In addition, the Commonwealth has been on notice of unlawful excessive hours being worked for Parliamentary staffers for many years, including by reason of inquiries and reports to Parliament. Most recently, Kate Jenkins’ 2001 Set the Standard report documents that staffers working excessive hours was an important factor in an unsafe workplace. Ms Rugg’s case will be a test case for what constitutes “reasonable” overtime or additional hours for parliamentary staffers and may impact other white -collar employees in the labour market. “If Ms Rugg’s case succeeds, it will open the door for further litigation including class actions,” Mr Bornstein said, adding the case would have implications for other Australian workers who claim to have been exploited by working undefined “reasonable additional hours”. Tomorrow morning, the federal court will hear Ms Rugg’s application for an injunction to restrain the termination of her employment. After that issue is determined, Ms Rugg will then pursue her claims for compensation and other orders against the commonwealth and Dr Monique Ryan. Resilient DJs customers send sales higher David Jones has recorded surging sales at its high-end department stores, defying expectations that inflation pressures would curb spending. Sales lifted by 13.6% in the first eight weeks of 2023, according to accounts lodged by its South African owner Woolworths Holding, which is not related to the supermarket chain. In the six months to December, turnover increased by nearly 32% compared to the corresponding period, underpinned by strong shopper demand at its inner-city Australian stores. The robust sales figures contrast with a spending pullback recorded at retailers Harvey Norman and JB Hi-Fi, which suggests demand for luxury goods is proving resilient. Woolworths chief executive, Roy Bagattini, said there were no signs that consumers were switching to cheaper products. “You would expect these impacts to play through into a much more softening of demand or consumer demand, but we haven’t seen that, frankly, in the first period of our second half and obviously we are buoyed by that,” he said. Woolworths paid just over $2bn for the department store chain in 2014, and has agreed to sell it to private equity firm Anchorage Capital Partners for a fraction of the price after it proved to be a difficult investment. The sale is expected to be completed by the end of March. As part of the deal, Woolworths will retain ownership of the department store’s prominent Bourke Street building in Melbourne. Sticky Fingers have been taken off the 2023 Bluesfest lineup, after weeks of backlash over their place on the bill. In a statement festival organisers said: We are sad to announce that Bluesfest has decided that Sticky Fingers is to step off the Bluesfest 2023 line-up. Bluesfest cannot, sadly, continue to support Sticky Fingers by having them play our 2023 edition and we apologise to those artists, sponsors and any others we involved in this matter through our mistaken belief that forgiveness and redemption are the rock on which our society is built. We thank everyone who has contacted us and advised their support in this matter, especially those suffering from a mental illness who feel that they cannot have their illness supported in a manner whereby they feel included in society. Sticky Fingers has done so many good deeds that have never been reported including building and funding recording studios and music education programs in disadvantaged regional communities. We will now move on, put this behind us and continue to plan and present our best-ever edition of Bluesfest… proudly. 2/2 Under questioning from senior counsel assisting, Justin Greggery KC, on Thursday, McGuirk was asked why she had not produced her emails to the commission showing she had backed income averaging when the scheme was being finalised. She told the royal commission she had been unable to locate them on her email archive. She said the commonwealth’s lawyers must have been able to find them through the email accounts of other witnesses. The commissioner, Catherine Holmes AC SC, pressed McGuirk about evidence she gave last year saying the first she’d learned of income averaging was in early 2017. Holmes said the most charitable explanation was “a false memory” of “having those sensations”. McGuirk said she based her evidence on the documents she had reviewed, adding she didn’t have an independent recollection of the time. Holmes replied: “So you invented a memory?” McGuirk said she’d given evidence to the best of her ability, but added: “Having seen these [documents] I accept there had been times where I had interacted [with robodebt] before.” McGuirk denied she had sought the new legal advice from Pulford with a “predetermined outcome” to back her own 2015 approval of the robodebt plan. That internal advice remained the only formal legal opinion in support of the scheme while it operated. McGuirk remains a public servant at DSS. The inquiry continues. Public servant grilled over claims she “invented a memory” at robodebt inquiry 1/2 A public servant faced intense questioning at the robodebt royal commission over claims she “invented a memory” to hide her role in the scandal. Emma-Kate McGuirk held roles at the departments of human services (DHS) and later social services (DSS), including playing a key role in the government response to a Commonwealth ombudsman’s investigation in early 2017. McGuirk told the commission last year she was among social services officials surprised to learn the robodebt scheme included the use of income averaging, given DSS had warned against this in 2015. But the commission was shown emails on Thursday that showed McGuirk, while at DHS, had given “program advice” approval for income averaging in May 2015, shortly before it was launched. The commission was also again shown a 2016 presentation from a DHS official that outlined the use of income averaging in the robodebt scheme. McGuirk, by this stage at DSS, accepted she was present at the presentation. The inquiry has been told that when the scheme faced the ombudsman’s investigation in early 2017, it was McGuirk who requested legal advice from a senior DSS lawyer, Anne Pulford. Pulford’s new advice contradicted her 2014 opinion saying averaging was unlawful. Activists pressuring federal government on Burrup peninsula development WA campaigners, Save Our Songlines are stepping up their protest against industrial activity on the Burrup peninsula in the Pilbara region, travelling to Sydney to pressure the federal government. They fear the massive Burrup hub expansion proposed by fossil fuel company Woodside could devastate ancient Indigenous rock art and sacred sites in the area, thought to be more than 60,000 years old. The federal government is currently deciding whether to grant the area cultural heritage protected status under federal legislation, with federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, recently having visited the state to announce the nomination of the Murujuga petroglyphs for Unesco World Heritage Protection. The campaigners, including traditional owner Raelene Cooper, were at Plibersek’s office in Sydney earlier today and were pushing for her to step in, saying that important local history is at risk if the project goes ahead. Cooper said: Any more industry on the Burrup means another Juukan Gorge on this minister’s watch, and Tanya Plibersek needs to act now to make permanent protections for Murujuga under existing legislation while we wait for World Heritage to be confirmed by the UN. We know that people in Tanya Plibersek’s electorate, and around the country, care about our culture and demand that this government protect it. We need to hold this government to account on its promises. The event began with a statement from Gadigal elder Aunty Rhonda Dixon-Grovenor who said she stood in solidarity with their struggle: I give my whole-hearted support to our guests that have travelled from the Pilbara to bring a message about the importance of protecting their sacred areas at Murujuga on the Burrup peninsula. The campaigners will also be meeting at the climate strike in Sydney’s Town Hall on Friday. Sydney’s future second airport in the city’s western outskirts has marked another step forward on its road to opening at the end of 2026, with the International Air Transport Association allocating the facility its three letter airport code. WSI will appear on routes and flight tickets for those travelling to Western Sydney International, which will be named Nancy Bird-Walton airport. Sydney’s main passenger airport, Kingsford-Smith airport in Mascot, uses SYD, as part of the same IATA code system that lists New York’s John F Kennedy International airport as JFK and Los Angeles International airport as LAX. In announcing the code allocation, the federal government said the western Sydney airport project has reached 40% completion, with the bulk earthworks finished and the airside, landslide and terminal construction expected to peak later this year. The airport is scheduled to commence operations in late 2026 and will be capable of catering for up to 10 million passengers a year. It will form the centre of the western Sydney aerotropolis, a new growth region of Sydney that will also feature a new central business district named Bradfield City. Infrastructure and transport minister Catherine King said the allocation of the WSI code “is an exciting step forward”, and that the airport project “is proving once again to be the catalyst for the socioeconomic transformation of this entire region”. Finance minister Katy Gallagher said the Western Sydney airport project had already created more than 3,800 direct jobs. That’s it from me for today, handing over to the lovely Cait Kelly! Union gravely concerned by suspension of students over protest The president of the National Tertiary Education Union at the University of Sydney has written to vice-chancellor Mark Scott expressing his “grave concern” about disciplinary measures taken against student activists who protested at an appearance of former prime minister Malcom Turnbull at the law society last September. Maddie Clark and Deaglan Godwin were suspended for a semester after a months-long investigation which they claimed they were gagged from talking about to media or friends. The students claimed the institution was attempting to “crack down on activism” by suspending them both for half the year, with their punishments only confirmed after classes returned this week. In an email sent to Scott, Nick Riemer said the protest was part of a “wider political context” that should have been taken into account by the institution: For a number of years now, we have been witnessing a dangerous escalation of political authoritarianism in this country ... protest is a cornerstone of any society which values democracy. There is no democratic requirement that it be decorous, measured or polite ... the university must not reinforce the dangerous anti-democratic norms that increasingly prevail in this country ... The much reported accusation that the protestors who dared to challenge [Turnbull] were ‘fascists’ is outrageous. Through its decision to suspend Deaglan and Maddie, the university can now be seen as validating this disgraceful slur ... the suspension dangerously cheapens our commitment to education, democracy and leadership, and I urge you to reverse it. A University of Sydney spokesperson wouldn’t confirm the punishments, saying they couldn’t comment on individual processes “due to our privacy responsibilities”. But they defended the institution’s decision, saying “we don’t take any disciplinary action lightly”. They said in a statement: We consider attempts to shut down speakers who have been invited to our campuses to participate in an exchange of views and ideas as contrary to our Charter of Freedom of Speech and Academic Freedom which defines the core values of our University in these matters. We have a rich history of activism and protest on our campuses, and all students and staff have the right to express themselves freely, as long as it’s done safely and in accordance with our policies and the law. Protests may be rowdy and spirited, but they cannot interfere with the rights and freedoms of others. The safety and wellbeing of our community is our number one priority. Coalition claims Labor leaders divided on tax policy The opposition leader Peter Dutton has accused the treasurer Jim Chalmers of “going to ground” after yesterday morning refusing to rule out changes to a capital gains tax on the family home. Speaking in the Melbourne suburb of Bayswater this afternoon, alongside the Liberal candidate for Aston, Roshena Campbell, Dutton brought out the same line which Sussan Ley used this morning that the PM and the treasurer were “at war” with each other. (While Albanese ruled out changes to a capital gains tax on the family home on ABC Radio yesterday morning, Chalmers did not on Sunrise before clarifying at a press conference later that day he should have, but adding he did not want to encourage the media playing the “rule-in, rule-out game”) Dutton went on to say today: [The Australian people] got a glimpse into the real Jim Chalmers yesterday. Jim Chalmers was rushed back out a couple of hours later to try and tidy up the mess. Obviously the prime minister’s urging and it seems today that the treasurer has gone to ground. Dutton’s sense of Chalmers having been rushed out yesterday at the PM’s insistence doesn’t quite square with the fact the treasurer had stepped up to speak on the release of the latest GDP figures as he does each quarter. Meanwhile, the treasurer’s low profile today could have more to do with him celebrating his 45th birthday. However, perhaps Dutton could be forgiven for not knowing, because only the PM received a celebratory tweet from Australian Labor. More electric car charging stations rolling out across South Australia The push to decarbonise transport is gathering pace, AAP reports. The Royal Automobile Association will develop a network of 140 stations across Adelaide and regional locations. It will include 86 AC fast-charging stations and 54 DC rapid and ultra-rapid locations, with construction to be complete by the end of next year. All will be powered by renewable energy, with the work supported by a $12.5m state government grant. The premier, Peter Malinauskas, said backing the faster uptake of electric vehicles made sense from an economic and environmental standpoint. At a time when petrol prices are stubbornly high, South Australia has abundant renewable energy, particularly in the middle of the day. Electric vehicles will play a crucial role in storing that energy and using it productively. Murder suspect arrives in Cairns after India manhunt The man suspected of killing Queensland woman Toyah Cordingley has touched down in Cairns, where he is expected to be charged with murder. Rajwinder Singh, 38, arrived on a privately chartered jet today after spending his first night in Australia behind bars. More than four years after Cordingley’s body was discovered partially buried on Wangetti Beach in October 2018, Singh made his return to the tourist city under police escort. Handcuffed and flanked by detectives, the former nurse arrived at the Queensland government air base in Cairns early on Thursday afternoon. He is expected to be taken to Cairns police station, where he will be formally charged. A day earlier, Singh arrived in Melbourne from Delhi before a Victorian magistrate ordered his return to the state he allegedly fled when Cordingley’s body was found. Police believe he hid out in Punjab state after fleeing Australia, leaving behind his wife and three children at their Innisfail home. Detective acting superintendent Kevin Goan said on Wednesday that Cordingley’s family had been told Singh would return to Queensland. He said: They’re clearly overwhelmed but delighted that, again, the judicial process will commence on Australian soil in the very near future. Magistrate Martin Grinberg ordered Singh to be extradited to Queensland after hearing police had DNA and telephone evidence linking him to the case. He has been remanded in custody and is expected to appear at a court in Cairns once charged. Singh denies having murdered Cordingley. - AAP Coalition vows to back Labor submarine choice The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has pledged the Coalition will support the Albanese government’s choice of nuclear submarine, despite suggesting US vessels are the best option. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is expected to travel to Washington this month to announce alongside US president Joe Biden and his UK counterpart, Rishi Sunak, which submarine Australia will acquire under the Aukus security partnership. Dutton has repeatedly insisted the US Virginia-class submarines remain the quickest and cheapest option for Australia, as speculation mounts an under-development British boat will be chosen. But he said the government will receive bipartisan support for its decision. The former defence minister told 2GB radio today: Labor’s going to make a decision about which submarine they go with, but we’ll support whatever decision they take. Dutton said his preference for the US model was “no slight on the Brits”. The Brits have been allies of ours forever and for the sake of our country I hope that’s always the case of the future. - AAP Wong extends Australia’s condolences to Turkey at G20 meeting Foreign minister Penny Wong has caught up with her Turkish, Singaporean and Canadian counterparts on the sidelines of the G20 foreign ministers meeting. Wong has personally conveyed to her Turkish counterpart Australia’s deepest condolences as they rebuild from last month’s earthquakes. She has also discussed cooperation on the energy transition and combatting food insecurity with Singapore, as well as Canada’s Indo-Pacific Strategy. NSW MPs trade barbs in housing debate The politicians vying for control of the New South Wales coffers have been questioned on their plans for housing in Sydney. Labor’s Mookhey said there needed to be a rebalancing of where development happens, including greater density “across the city” rather than focusing just on Western Sydney. Treasurer Kean rebuked: I hope every person living in a ‘teal’ seat has just heard Labor’s plan for overdevelopment across the city’s east and north. Asked to describe each other in one word, Kean called Mookhey a “unionist” and Mookhey called Kean a “showman”. The debate has concluded. Labor stands by policy on public sector wages New South Wales Labor’s treasury spokesperson, Daniel Mookhey, defended Labor’s plan to scrap the public sector wage cap if it forms government after 25 March. He said that the government should not be able to avoid bargaining with workers as private companies are required to do, which he also argued was causing people to leave the public sector. He said: When we are facing such a critical shortage, when we don’t even have enough teachers in our classrooms, then yes, we say it is time to do something differently. Treasurer, Matt Kean, said the policy would cost businesses who would have to compete with the government for labour. He said: We have a wage cap in place that’s maintained fiscal discipline, which is how we’ve delivered the services and infrastructure that this state deserves. If that wages cap is removed, then it will blow the budget. A graph compiled by the Sydney Morning Herald last week used ATO data to reveal the breakdown of the 300,000 Australians with more than $1m in superannuation in 2019. Ever since, speculation has been rife as to the identity of the person with $544m in their super account but news.com.au has crossed one suspect off the list. Yesterday a spokesperson for Gina Rinehart told the publication she does not own the country’s richest super account: I can confirm that Mrs Rinehart is not the person with that $544 million super balance. NSW Coalition and Labor vie for business votes The New South Wales treasurer, Matt Kean, and opposition treasury spokesperson, Daniel Mookhey, are making their pitches to the NSW business community at an event at the Sydney CBD. Kean used the Business NSW event to announce a Coalition government would pay businesses dealing with the state within five business days. He said: We understand that cashflow is critically important for your success now and into the future. Kean took aim at Labor’s plan to lift public sector wages: What it will mean for each and every one of you is that you will now be competing for labour against the public service who were paying huge wage increases. Imagine what happens when you’re competing against the might of government and the public servants who were paid huge pay increases. Labor’s Mookhey said part of his plan to improve the economy was to stabilise the energy grid and energy prices, as well as bring manufacturing onshore. He said: We are committed to creating the NSW energy security cooperation, whose mission is to partner with you [businesses] to stabilise the grid so we can bring on more of the future power we need at a price people can afford. I want NSW to be a state that makes things again. NSW Greens announce energy policy to ‘decarbonise the economy’ The NSW Greens have announced their energy policy heading into the March state election with a plan to “decarbonise the economy and deliver affordable renewable energy, for every household”. Under the plan, the party says it would establish a new public, non-profit electricity company called PowerNSW to reduce power bills. They would also invest in publicly owned renewable energy projects, stop all new coal and gas projects and phase out the use of coal and gas for energy by 2030. Gas would be banned on new builds from 1 July 2024. There is also a proposed package to support households and tackle energy poverty with: rollout of energy efficiency upgrades, rebates and zero interest loans of up to $3,000 to help households replace gas appliances with energy efficient ones mandated minimum efficiency and thermal comfort standards for rental properties by 2028 The Greens spokesperson for treasury and energy, Abigail Boyd, said the proposals would “deliver affordable renewable energy for every household”. We must take back control over our power supply and ensure that we are never again at the mercy of the private market for our energy needs. Cath Blakely, the party’s candidate for the seat of Wollongong, said the plan “will immediately provide cost-of-living relief by lowering power bills, and lays out a plan for electrification by getting one million homes off gas”. Energy bills are skyrocketing across the state, plunging people into energy poverty, but neither NSW Labor nor the Coalition have any credible plan to reduce energy costs for households. Robert rejects in ‘strongest possible terms’ that he didn’t take seriously robodebt advice from solicitor general Former government services minister Stuart Robert has rejected in the “strongest possible terms” claims aired at a royal commission that he didn’t take the solicitor-general advice on the robodebt scheme seriously. Robert also rejected as non-sensical claims levelled by the former secretary of the Department of Human Services, Renee Leon, on Tuesday that the minister had responded to her recommendation that the program cease and the government apologise by saying “we will double down”. The inquiry heard on Tuesday that Leon had told Robert in a November 2019 meeting that the best course following the solicitor-general’s advice was to apologise, cease the scheme and tell customers how they’d fix the problem. She claimed Robert said they would “absolutely not be doing that” and would double down. Asked about the alleged encounter on Thursday, Robert said: I don’t recall that. It would be completely inconsistent with the fact that I’ve got the solicitor-general’s advice, advice I wanted. I’d taken it to the prime minister, the prime minister had agreed to an urgent ERC, he’s agreed to ceasing averaging solely and partially, he wanted to look at further proof points … I would have relayed that to the secretary. The idea, somewhat farcically, that I’ve come out of the prime minister’s office, who’s agreed with the solicitor-general’s view, agreed to an urgent ERC the next week, that I would then ignore those two and say we’re going to double down on the same project, doesn’t make any sense at all. Robert also rejected claims he had remarked during a verbal briefing on the solicitor-general’s advice in late October 2019 that “legal advice is just advice”. Leon’s evidence was that Robert was briefed in writing about the risks of continuing the program following this alleged comment, which she said was evidence to demonstrate he didn’t support stopping the program. Robert said: I completely reject that ... in the strongest possible terms. I asked for the advice, I wanted it. My department took months and months and months to get it to me, and when they had it, they ostensibly sat on it for six weeks ... When I got it, I demonstrated the seriousness by walking straight into the prime minister’s office. Dwelling approvals slump 28%, with houses at 10-year lows We’re told by the RBA and others that the answer to solving the housing crisis is supply. Based on the latest dwelling approvals data from the ABS out today, a boost of supply is not likely to be forthcoming for a while at least. Total approvals slumped 27.6% in January, seasonally adjusted, more than reversing the 15.3% gain in December, the ABS says. (CBA has predicted a 7% slide in the total.) For private sector houses, approvals sank 13.8%, the fifth month in a row of falls, bringing the number to its lowest since June 2012. The overall dwellings retreat was led by a 49% dive in NSW and nearly 39% in Victoria, the two most populous states. Queensland, which is enjoying a bit of a population rush, bucked the trend with a 25.6% rise for the month, led mostly by new flats going up. In value terms, the building approvals were off 18.6%. Today’s numbers will also be a drag on economic activity which is already slowing as we saw with yesterday’s GDP numbers. With more interest rate rises to come, it won’t be surprising if approvals fall even more. The Housing Industry Association, a lobby group for the sector, is already predicting 2023 will be the worst year in a decade for new construction. RMIT will launch the first dual degree program with India under the nation’s sweeping new education policy. Announced on a delegation with education minister Jason Clare at Delhi on Thursday, the higher education partnership with Birla Institute of Technology and Science will begin in mid 2023. India’s National Education Policy came into effect in 2022 with the aim of attracting international universities to set up branch campuses in the nation and rapidly expanding its tertiary education sector. The partnership will initially offer four undergraduate engineering programs through a dual degree and a PhD program. Students will initially learn at BITS followed by two years at RMIT, with potential careers in Australia or India. RMIT academics will also be able to teach at BITS. RMIT vice-chancellor professor Alec Cameron said the academy was a “strategic step” in strengthening the university’s presence in India. BITS vice-chancellor Professor Souvik Bhattacharyya said the academy would be a “new dimension” in trans-national education and research. We look forward to a new era of academic cooperation that will define and deliver the best attributes of a global graduate and citizen. International academics have told Times Higher Education they are skeptical India’s policy will attract many takers, citing concerns over academic freedom and a heavily bureaucratic system. Robert is then asked about his doorstop interview regarding the Gordon Legal class action, which he called a “political stunt”. Scott: Do you accept that your assertion of a 99.2% effectiveness rate, based on the state of mind that you say you arrived at on the 4 July 2019, was false? Robert: I do accept that now, but again Mr Scott, as I said to the commissioner, I am still at that stage a cabinet minister. I’m still required to uphold, until such time as I am advised lawfully otherwise, the requirement for the government program, I’d still have to defend it. That is the job I’ve got. Scott: Despite what you knew to be the case, which is that you could not lawfully rely on income averaging as a sole basis to calculate and raise a debt? Robert: Despite what I thought was the case, noting I am not a lawyer …while I couldn’t reconcile the numbers that doesn’t mean I couldn’t be wrong and until such time as I have got the advice, respectfully Mr Scott I have no choice as a cabinet minister but to defend government policy. Robert is admitting he made false statements about robodebt in media interviews because of cabinet solidarity. Asked about his interview with Laura Tingle in August 2019, Robert says “one doesn’t tend to forget interviews with Laura Tingle.” Robert’s response to Tingle’s questions about income averaging was a flat-out defence of it. He tells the commission now he was bound by cabinet solidarity regardless of his personal views at the time. Scott: Do you accept, Mr Robert, that what you’ve said in response to that question from Ms Tingle is inconsistent with the state of mind you assert you held at the conclusion of the deep dive session? Robert: Yes I do, keeping in mind if I’ve got a personal opinion, my next step is to seek the appropriate advice, until such time as that arrives, I remain a cabinet minister and I am responsible for holding the cabinet line which is what I have done in the interview. … In every interview government ministers are expected to show confidence in the government. Cabinet ministers can’t go out and defend some parts of the government’s program and be wishy-washy on others. That is just not how a government can operate Sir, respectfully. Robert was also asked about his interview with David Speers in July 2019: Holmes: Your evidence was that you could not raise a debt based solely on averaging. Robert: That was my belief, yes. Holmes: And in 90% of cases that is exactly what was happening under the program to your knowledge. Robert: That is correct. Holmes: So what you said there, to your knowledge, at the time was false. Robert: My personal view, yes, but I am still a government minister and it is still a government program and this was the approach that cabinet had signed off on three or four years earlier and had been going on and until such time as I’m not a lawyer, I’ve got a competent legal view, it is still just my opinion. Probed that he knew the departmental figures couldn’t be right, Robert answers: I had a massive personal misgiving, yes, but I’m still a cabinet minister. Holmes: Yes, but it doesn’t compel you to say things that you don’t believe to be true, surely? It’s one thing to stick to the policy and say this is how we do it and we are confident in the program but to actually give statistics which you couldn’t have believed to be accurate is another thing, isn’t it? Robert: They were the numbers from the department based on the working approach to how the program was being run. They were the accepted figures by government to use. And as a dutiful cabinet minister, that is what we do. Robert says it’s ‘unconscionable’ he was not given the advice Robert: The fact that that would not be given to me in writing is simply unconscionable. And I’ve chosen my words carefully. Robert says he didn’t receive AGS advice on 4 July Robert is claiming he didn’t receive the advice from the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS). This wasn’t told to me by the secretary on the 27th, it was not in the blue book, it wasn’t in brief 119 which covered all the legal aspects, it wasn’t attached to nor referred to nor inferred of, in cabinet brief 120. So on the 4 July, what I’m hearing and seeing from you is that my department had a brief and now had it for 27 March … Scott: Yes. Robert: Therefore almost 100 days and [they] have not informed me in writing in any way shape or form. I do not recall this being briefed to me, I don’t recall my department saying on the 4 July we have an AGS advice, because if we did, my actions would have been consistent with what I did on the 7 November when the SG advice arrived. My department had it for seven or eight weeks, I had it for two hours before I walked straight into the prime minister’s office unannounced, put it down and said, we need to stop this, that was my actions then, if I had a copy of this, or if someone had chatted to me, not too sure if I or my staff would have got to the person first to take it from them. And then if I read that, I suspect my actions would have been the same as what I did on the 7 November as soon as I got the substantive brief in the assistant general. Robert says decision was made to seek legal advice on partial use of ATO average income data Robert says he started thinking the sole use of Australian Tax Office data was insufficient, but partial use might be OK, and therefore a decision was made to seek legal advice. Scott is confirming with Robert that, based on his statement: You then held a strong personal view that the sole use of ATO average income data was insufficient to raise the debt but was unsure the partial use of ATO average income data was sufficient to raise the debt. For that reason, you decided that the next [move] to progress the issue was to obtain legal advice. Robert: Yes, there would have been a discussion about it, in terms of my staff unable to answer my obtuse, using those words, examples. My recollection is that there was little pushback in the room, everyone agreed that we needed to get it right. Stuart Robert: Treasury and Social Services ‘fundamentally different’ Robert tells the inquiry that when he began as human services minister he had previously been assistant treasurer and the way the two departments worked were “fundamentally different”. At this point coming from Treasury, and having done over 30 bits of [legislation] in nine months I’m very attuned to how Treasury works. Reading through it all became fairly obvious to my team and I that how Treasury works is fundamentally different to how Social Security works. And trying to pair the two is always going to be incredible difficult. Robert said the Department of Human Services had a different way of calculating from the Treasury portfolio. He gave the example to his staff that robodebt just did not make sense if someone had earned no income for 51 weeks and then had earned $1m in the 52nd week, if you average that across 26 fortnights it would raise a debt and that could not be possible. Stuart Robert, the human services and government services minister during the time of the robodebt scheme, has begun to give evidence at the royal commission on the matter. Counsel assisting Angus Scott KC will be taking Robert’s evidence. My colleague Luke Henriques Gomes is listening in too and gives you a bit of background on Robert: Property prices in flood-hit regions have slumped With the anniversary of the Biblical deluges in northern NSW and south-eastern Queensland, a lot of attention has understandably been focused on the ongoing challenges facing those flood-hit communities. Data group CoreLogic, though, has put out an assessment of what’s happened to the regions’ property prices over the past year. Bearing in mind that capital city prices are down about 9% from their peaks (according to ANZ), it seems these regions have fared a lot worse. Here’s CoreLogic’s assessment of the regions in northern NSW: And the view for the suburbs around Brisbane (not quite so bad): Kaytlin Ezzy, a CoreLogic economist, said: While the current tightening cycle has amplified the downturn in values, the declines seen across flood-impacted suburbs are significantly steeper compared to the broader region and are among the largest suburb declines nationally. Outside of one flood-impacted suburb in Brisbane, all other suburbs recording similar value declines were more expensive [than] Sydney suburbs, which are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates. Given household wealth and consumption are often linked, the slump in property prices might have a lingering effect on economic activity in the areas, it would seem. On the other hand, would falling values attract more people to live there? Ezzy leans towards a long-term drag, not least because of the scale of the flood events possibly precluding a rebound in property prices seen after floods in earlier years. Given the severity of this event, and the short timeframe between major flood events, it’s likely the current value declines across the Northern Rivers and impacted house suburbs in Brisbane could be more enduring. Notably, “homeowners, lenders and insurers are becoming more cautious of the risks associated with climate change and are adjusting their risk premiums accordingly”, Ezzy says. Indeed, those higher risk premiums are likely to extend to other regions exposed to climate extremes in a warming world. Given Australia’s notoriously volatile climate, particularly for rainfall, that could just about take in the whole country. The federal government has received another review into disturbing allegations of sexual harassment and cultural problems on remote Antarctic stations, which includes “substantial” recommendations for change. The independent report by former Swimming Australia chief executive Leigh Russell, was commissioned by the environment department in September last year. It was prompted by an earlier report by ANU Professor Meredith Nash, which raised allegations of unwanted physical contact, displays of pornography, and limited provision for women menstruating. Environment minister Tanya Plibersek described the Nash report as disappointing and shocking. She called for urgent cultural change and the department commissioned Russell to make further recommendations to government. “I was actually gobsmacked to read some of the reports here talking about pornographic material up on the walls [because] I really did think that we had eradicated this thing from Australians decades ago.” Department of Climate Change, Environment and Water secretary, David Fredericks, said the Russell review makes a significant number of recommendations that need to be carefully assessed. In a statement, Fredericks said he planned to release the report later this month: Ms Russell’s review is a comprehensive analysis of progress on cultural change and creating an inclusive workplace, and the adequacy of systems, policies and processes to support people who work for the Australian Antarctic Division. The report makes a substantial number of findings and it is important that we now give careful consideration to this review, its findings and recommendations. These are complex workplace issues. our response needs to be considered and have due regard to the work, health and safety of staff. Hundreds of people are being evacuated from remote communities in the Northern Territory as floodwaters threaten to isolate them. Emergency management minister, Murray Watt, says he’s approved Australian Defence Force aircraft and personnel to assist the evacuations. Opposition leader Peter Dutton has levelled his latest criticism of the proposed Indigenous voice, raising concerns it would “disrupt” local decision-making in Aboriginal communities and “override the local elders”. The Liberal party is still to come to a party-room position on the referendum, and appears to be in no rush to do so – but escalating criticisms from deputy leader Sussan Ley, and maintained concern from Dutton, have some inside the party speculating the Liberals could resolve a formal no position (like the Nationals) or just allow their members to campaign and vote whichever way they like. A formal yes position, according to some, seems unlikely. On Sky News last night, Dutton pointed to his recent visits to Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory and Western Australia, as factors against the voice – claiming some areas were doing fine on their own. Dutton said: They don’t want to be disrupted by a voice. I mean they support a voice, they made that very clear, but they don’t want a voice that is going to disrupt their local decision-making. The voice has the potential to override the local Indigenous elders voice, and so people are understandably – even in the communities – asking for detail. Sky host Peta Credlin, former chief of staff to Tony Abbott, claimed “a lot of people are concerned, even when they have sympathy” towards the voice concept. Dutton agreed, claiming there was “a rising level of frustration with the way in which the prime minister’s approached this debate”. He said: In some other communities, in Leonora for example, where we went in WA, huge issues around alcohol and violence etc, domestic violence, abuse of children, all of that playing out there. The voice is the furthest thing from their mind. Dutton claimed there had been “no engagement with us through any of that process”. PM Anthony Albanese said he has met with Dutton at least six times about the voice in recent months. Dutton has been invited to two meetings of the government’s referendum working group. Australia Post chief: ‘We are very aware of our significant service obligations and we want to ensure we maintain those’ Graham goes on to say how Australia Post has become a “two speed business”: We have a distinct two-speed business, with our letters business weighing heavily on the e-commerce driven parcel business where we compete with multinationals and strong local players. We seek to gain bigger market share, but if we don’t address our letter business, that will impact our ability to service the community, not just in our mail business and parcel business, our bank of post and other broad services we provide. We have started making change amid the challenges we face, but we want to hear from the community about what they want and how we chart our way forward as an essential service to the community. The good news is a financially sustainable, modernised Australia Post will continue to invest to meet the changing needs of communities in metropolitan Australia and regional and rural Australia. We are looking to continue to increase more delivery points, create more efficiency and make it easier for people to do business with Australia Post. We are very aware of our significant service obligations and we want to ensure we maintain those, but the way in doing it is to be sure we have a financially viable Australia Post. We look forward to working with the government and all stakeholders on this process and taking the feedback to help shape the future of Australia Post for the next 214 years. Australia Post CEO: ‘We don’t want to be a burden on the Australian taxpayer’ Australia Post CEO Paul Graham follows the minister, saying the organisation welcomes today’s announcement and wants to modernise so as not to become a “burden” on the taxpayer. Australia Post warmly welcomes the minister’s announcement today and we support both the discussion paper and the consultation process. The discussion paper in modernising the service of Australia Post is a conversation that frankly the Australian community needs to have. Our letters business is in unstoppable decline since 2008 and we face a difficult future as fewer people send letters and consumers increasingly embrace digital – a trend play playing out globally. Australia Post plays a critical role in the lives of all Australians and particularly in rural and regional Australia and remote areas. That will never change. For the past three years we invested more than $1 billion in our network, digital capability, people and services and we will continue to do that to ensure we are meeting the future and today’s needs of our customers. But despite this, we’re on a path to significant losses as Australians and the national postal service changes. We’re an entirely self-funded business. We don’t want to be a burden on the Australian taxpayer and using the funds we would otherwise lose to ensure that the government continue to invest in the right things for the community – hospitals, schools, roads etc. Australia Post workers to trial different delivery models Michelle Rowland: Lastly, I want to acknowledge the most important asset of Australia Post is its people – the 60,000 workforce. I acknowledge the work undertaken by the Communication Workers’ Union in conjunction with Australia Post to jointly develop trials of different delivery models. Feedback on the model will also be undertaken throughout April and June and it is vitally important the workforce is brought along on the journey, they’re properly consulted and that we understand how important they are to ensure Australia Post remains financially viable, so that their jobs, their good-paying jobs, also remain viable. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has stepped up to speak in Sydney alongside the CEO of Australia Post, Paul Graham, announcing the launch of a discussion paper to ensure the service remains viable in the modern age. Rowland says it’s a matter of updating the regulations in order to ensure Australia Post remains a “key driver of productivity” in the economy: Australia Post is a cherished national institution over 200 years. It delivers to over 12 million delivery points right around Australia. It performs a range of vital community service obligations, and especially in rural and regional Australia. Australia Post not only serves as the post office, often it is the only banking service in town, the newsagent, or the retailer, so it is important. But we know that Australia Post has been facing many challenges over a long period of time. These include the decline in letters being sent and received, and also the rise of parcels, and we know that Australia Post faces particular competition from international competitors who are coming in, building their own networks, and Australia Post needs to ensure that it remains viable. So what I’m doing today is releasing a consultation paper on the future of Australia Post. What do consumers expect? What do small businesses need? How can rural and regional Australia be best served by this iconic institution? It’s important for Australia Post to be seen as a key driver of productivity in our economy. It needs to be adaptive. It cannot stand still. We have seen what happens around the world to state-sponsored postal services when they fail. They fail their consumers and they fail their economies. We will not let this happen to Australia Post. That is the reason why we are kick-starting this process to modernise Australia Post. They are currently subject to essentially the same regulatory burdens as they had 25 years ago. We need to understand the challenges that Australia Post faces, but equally we need to be transparent and listen to Australians about what they need and how Australia Post can best service them – that is the purpose of this consultation. The Western Australian government has announced it plans to open new areas for oil and gas exploration. The state’s mines and petroleum minister, Bill Johnston, said industry could nominate areas for the state’s annual acreage release, part of a government strategy for “promoting petroleum exploration”: The McGowan government will continue to support opportunities to invest in the petroleum exploration sector to help find the next big discovery. We are calling for industry to get involved and help shape the future of WA’s petroleum sector. It comes as bids are due to close for exploration permits over 10 areas covering nearly 47,000 sqkm the Albanese government announced last year would be opened for offshore exploration. At the time, the commonwealth acreage release was described as making a mockery of climate targets. Tim Beshara, of the Wilderness Society, described the latest announcement in WA as “intergenerational recklessness”. It’s hard to imagine a worse thing a government could do regarding climate and environment in 2023 than to lock in the carbon someone will seek to burn in 2073. Victorian government announces $10m for mRNA training The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has announced the government will spend $10m to establish a mRNA training centre to create a pipeline of workers to produce the next generation of vaccines and medicines. The training centre will be based at Monash University in Clayton and will provide specialised training to workers across all aspects of the mRNA manufacturing life cycle. Speaking at the university on Thursday, the premier said mRNA technology had the potential to be used to treat cancer, neurodegenerative conditions like MS and other conditions: The possibilities are endless. But if you haven’t got staff, you simply can’t do the work and that will always hold us back. That’s why this $10 million investment, together with our strong partnership with Monash University in so many different ways, really does set us up strongly for the future, whether it be exports, jobs in advanced manufacturing of these therapeutics and other vaccines. It’s not far from Moderna’s mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility currently under construction in Clayton, which once complete, will be capable of producing 100m vaccine doses annually. The facility is being established under a 10-year partnership between the federal and Victorian government and Moderna. It is Moderna’s first mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility to be built outside North America. Former Coalition minister Stuart Robert to front robodebt inquiry Stuart Robert, the human services and government services minister during the time of the robodebt scheme, will today front the royal commission on the matter. The commission earlier this week heard evidence that the former Coalition minister told the head of his department to “double down” on robodebt rather than admit fault. My colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes will be listening in to the hearings, and we’ll bring you what Robert has to say on the blog. Greens say Australia Post must remain a publicly owned service The Greens have weighed in on the future of Australia Post, with a statement from Greens spokesperson for communications Sarah Hanson-Young calling on the Albanese government to rule out privatising postal services. Based on communications minister Michelle Rowland’s interviews this morning, she has clearly stated “Australia Post will not be privatised”. Here’s Hanson-Young’s full statement: The Greens will look at the consultation paper and changes proposed by the government closely. Rumours about privatising postal services were at fever pitch under the previous Morrison Government - Labor should rule this out. Australia Post is a publicly-owned essential service that must truly service all Australians, whether that’s in the city or the bush. Any review must be centred on delivering what everyday households and businesses need, not simply profits that deliver big salaries and bonuses to executives. Australians receiving on average about two letters a week as parcel business ‘booming’, communications minister says On the state of letter-writing in the country, Rowland says the decline is due to increasing digitisation as well as other considerations like the environment: The letter volumes we’ve seen are in decline. These are the facts. Some 97% of letters that go out these days are actually sent by businesses and government. And even in those cases they are becoming increasingly digitised and we know that for many businesses, that is certainly their aim, not only for cost-cutting but also to meet any obligations they have under, for example, environmental obligations. So when you have Australians receiving on average about two letters a week now, you need to really have a look at where demand is. And I actually see this very much, as I discussed with small business representatives and other people interested in this area – this is very much a productivity driver. On the other hand, Rowland says parcel business is “booming” but unregulated: We know that parcels business is booming with some half a billion parcels delivered last year, but this is an unregulated side of Australia Post’s business and it’s subject to intense competition from major international players who are building, or are in the process of having built, their own networks. So we want to make sure that Australia Post remains financially sustainable and viable, because that means we can have good, well-paying jobs, the needs of Australians are met … Just to also make this point – I think many of your viewers will be surprised to learn that the regulations governing Australia Post today are essentially the same as they were 25 years ago. So that was 10 years before the first iPhone came into view as well. It’s important we address this now. Communications minister: Australia Post will not be privatised Michelle Rowland, the communications minister, is doing the rounds this morning on breakfast programs following the release of a discussion paper seeking to make changes to Australia Post, with question marks around daily letter deliveries. Rowland told ABC News Breakfast: The whole point of this consultation that we’re kicking off today is to understand from Australians and in particular from small businesses and people representing rural and regional Australia, what they need in a modern Australia Post, have a look at the options going forward, but be upfront about the facts and the challenges that Australia Post is facing. We are very clear [and] upfront in the principles of this consultation that Australia Post will not be privatised, that we prioritise the needs of rural and regional Australia and that we want to hear from Australian consumers, businesses, and anyone with an interest in this great institution, about what they believe needs to be done going forward. Police are investigating the death of a 40-year-old man who was shot outside a gym in Sydney’s south-west this morning. Bankstown police were called to Sefton just after 6.30am where they found a man with a gunshot wound. The man died at the scene despite the efforts of NSW Ambulance paramedics, police said. There are reports the man was sitting in a car outside the gym when he was shot at from a passing car. A man who was nearby says he heard a series of shots he initially thought was a car backfiring. He told Sydney radio 2GB: As I heard a car speed off there was another series of bangs. Within minutes there was a load of ambulances, police everywhere, and then we saw a man on the ground, not in a good way. Channel 7 is reporting that a car was found on fire at Birrong train station nearby. Police said in a statement: A crime scene has been established, which is being examined by specialist forensic officers. Local detectives, with the assistance of the State Crime Command’s Homicide Squad, have commenced investigations into the circumstances surrounding the incident. – with AAP Remote NT communities isolated by tropical low Heavy rain continues to batter the Northern Territory as a deep tropical low tracks slowly east across the state, AAP reports. Hundreds of people are being evacuated from remote communities where flood waters threaten to isolate residents. Heavy rainfall and potential flash flooding are forecast for parts of the Gregory, Tanami, Barkly and Carpentaria districts on Thursday. The rain is expected to spread east across the Barkly, with six-hourly rainfall totals between 90mm and 140mm possible. Intense storm cells and damaging wind gusts are forecast for the area south of Kalkarindji to Renner Springs. Territory authorities declared an emergency for communities where the upper Victoria River reached major flood levels on Wednesday. About 700 people were to be relocated by air to Katherine and then driven by bus to temporary accommodation in Darwin. NT police commander Daniel Bacon said access roads to the communities had been cut, with residents of Daguragu evacuated to Kalkarindji ahead of further inundation expected on Wednesday night. The Victoria River at Kalkarindji surpassed the major flood level of 14m, and was at 16.02 metres and still rising on Thursday morning. The town, about 550km south of Darwin, recorded the highest rainfall of 133mm to 9am on Wednesday. The Bureau of Meteorology has warned residents of flash flooding across the Top End in locations including Tennant Creek, Elliott, Kalkarindji, Lajamanu, Renner Springs and Mallapunyah. Authorities have urged people in the area to avoid unnecessary travel to allow for a safe evacuation. Australia one of 105 co-sponsors backing Vanuatu climate bid Guardian Australia revealed yesterday that Australia had agreed to co-sponsor Vanuatu’s historic bid for the international court of justice to rule on the climate crisis, including the international legal consequences for causing significant environmental harm. The full list of co-sponsors was released this morning – and it shows Vanuatu’s diplomatic effort over several years has been incredibly successful. Australia is one of 105 co-sponsors. The initiative has strong support from Pacific island countries, and the other co-sponsors include Canada, the UK, New Zealand, France and Germany. But notable exceptions – countries that are not co-sponsors – include the US, China and Russia. The resolution is expected to be put to the UN general assembly within weeks. It seeks an advisory opinion from the ICJ on the international obligations that countries have to act on the climate crisis – with a request to pay particular attention to the harm experienced by small island developing countries that are especially vulnerable to the effects of the climate crisis. The ICJ will also be asked to consider “peoples and individuals of the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change”. It is understood the Albanese government will portray its support as recognition that climate change is “the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific”. In a statement, Jotham Napat, Vanuatu’s foreign minister, said today: While severe Cyclone Judy is today showing no mercy on the people of Vanuatu, it is welcoming news that countries are committing to co-sponsor Vanuatu’s UN Resolution on clarifying international climate obligations. Shiva Gounden, a Pacific adviser to Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said: To see Australia and nations around the world standing with Vanuatu and Pacific island nations on the frontlines of the climate crisis cannot stop these impacts or end the pain they cause. But it does bring the Pacific Vuvale [family] closer together and show that the world recognises Pacific leadership in driving global solutions from the frontlines. For more on this issue, see our story from last night: Kamay spears stolen by Captain Cook returned to country When James Cook and his crew first made contact with Aboriginal people in 1770, the British soldiers took dozens of spears from their camps. More than 250 years later, four of those spears will be returned to the Gweagal people of Botany Bay, which is known as Kamay in the local Indigenous language. A formal announcement will be made at Bare Island today. The removal of spears by Captain Cook and botanist Joseph Banks was a significant and lasting loss to the local Aboriginal community, as it was a theft of their cultural knowledge handed from generation to generation. For now, the artefacts remain at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, as part of an archaeology and anthropology collection. But they will soon be physically returned to their rightful custodians and displayed at the new visitor centre being constructed at Botany Bay. The permanent repatriation to the La Perouse Aboriginal Community is being assisted by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies and the Gujaga Foundation. - AAP New music pays tribute to Aboriginal activist’s 1938 protest against Nazi Germany A new song cycle from Lior, Nigel Westlake and Dr Lou Bennett will pay tribute to Yorta Yorta elder William Cooper and his 1938 march protesting against Nazi Germany. Following Kristallnacht, Cooper’s group marched two hours to the German consulate on Collins Street to register their “strong protest at the cruel persecution of the Jewish people”. Their resolution read: Our people have suffered much cruelty, exploitation and misunderstanding as a minority at the hands of another people. The Nazi government has a consulate here on our land. Let us go there and make our protest known. As Melbourne-based singer-songwriter Lior and composer Nigel Westlake were contemplating a companion piece to their 2013 song cycle Compassion, they were inspired by Cooper’s courage. You can read more about the new musical collaboration from Walter Marsh here: The opposition finance spokeswoman Jane Hume concedes “there is not a lot of sympathy out there for people with balances of more than $3m”. However, speaking on the Today Show, she’s questioned the government’s figure of 80,000 people being affected: How many people will it capture in two years’ time? Who will fall into the net in five years, 10 years, 20 years because that $3m hasn’t been indexed? Swimmer missing in surf off NSW far north coast A search is resuming for a man who went missing while swimming in rough surf at Byron Bay on the NSW far north coast. NSW police say two people saw the man struggling in the surf, about 30 metres offshore of Main beach about 5.30pm on Wednesday. A 22-year-old man swum out in a bid to rescue the distressed man but had to turn back after being overwhelmed by the conditions. Police, Ambulance, Surf Life Saving, Fire and Rescue, Marine Rescue and Queensland PolAir personnel began searching for the man but they had to suspend it about 8.30pm after failing to find any trace of the swimmer. His personal items were found on the beach but no one has been reported missing. - AAP It’s a happy birthday to Australia’s prime minister Anthony Albanese and treasurer Jim Chalmers who share the same birthday. Albanese told Radio National yesterday he’ll be celebrating by having lunch with his partner and son, so a joint party does not appear to be on the cards. It’s the big 60 for Albanese and 45 for Chalmers. A couple of Labor politicians have already taken to social media with a birthday shoutout for the “boss”, but who knows –the rest could be making a concerted effort to boost Australia Post’s letter deliveries. Ley and Dutton express support for Bridget Archer after rumours Liberal party could dump her Yesterday our political editor Katharine Murphy brought you the story that a veteran party insider suggested that the Liberal party could dump outspoken moderate Bridget Archer ahead of the next federal election. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, came out in support of Archer when asked about the issue at a press conference, declaring her “an important part of our team”. Archer appears to have the firm support of the Liberal leadership, with Dutton’s deputy Sussan Ley doing the same. Ley told ABC Radio she should “absolutely” retain her spot as the candidate for Bass at the next election: Bridget is a friend, a colleague and a terrific member for the seat of Bass. I visited her not that long ago, and she’s doing great work and she’s an amazing woman, amazing woman. And you know, Patricia how much I respond well to amazing women. Ley quizzed on scale of impact from super changes Ley doesn’t directly answer whether she believes people with more than $3m in super savings are doing it tough – she says it’s the principle. Karvelas: Do you think 80,000 people who’ve got more than $3m are really doing it tough? Ley: Well, that $3 million is not indexed. That will change over time. And the principle is the thing that Australians will note. Karvelas: But are they doing it tough? Ley: I’m not here to say who’s doing it tough and who’s not doing it tough. Karvelas: Australians are doing it tough, though, aren’t they? And some are obviously not doing it tough. Ley: Well, people are doing it tough for the government that hasn’t got the fiscal policy settings right. And doesn’t understand how to manage money and doesn’t have spending constraints anywhere within its programs. In all of this conversation, we have not heard anyone say that we’re going to save money. I mean, that seems to be just a passing comment from the government. Yes, of course. People are doing tough. They’re doing it tough because they can’t pay their electricity bills. They’re doing it tough because their mortgages are going up. Karvelas: But they’re not the people with more than $3 million in their super accounts. Ley: I’m not going to comment on what individual people might be experiencing in their family budgets. The direction this government is going is one that breaks faith with the Australian people and misunderstands the sound fundamental basis, which is: it’s your money, you deserve to keep more of it. ‘Treasurer at war with the PM’ over tax policy, Ley claims The deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, follows Gallagher on ABC Radio. She’s not letting go of the divergence that emerged on breakfast shows yesterday morning between the PM and the treasurer on ruling out changes to capital gains tax on the family home. It was cleared up by a lunchtime presser where Chalmers ruled out the measure and acknowledged he “should have done the same this morning”. Ley says: Your program exposed it well. We’ve got a treasurer at war with the prime minister, a prime minister who’s openly overruling his treasurer – look, it’s school yard stuff – and breaking promises made more than 97 times, opening the door now to more tax increases, and even taxing the family home. I think there’s a new test for the Albanese government, Patricia – I’m going to call it the PK test. Whatever idea Jim Chalmers floats in the papers, if that’s confirmed by the prime minister on Radio National, then we know they’re on the same page. Otherwise, I don’t know whether they are at all, and right now they’ve completely failed that test. Patricia Karvelas goes on to try get Ley to respond to the changes the Coalition made to superannuation without a mandate: You were a cabinet minister in 2016 when Malcolm Turnbull proposed a 15% tax on super accounts above $1.6m, which affected, actually, eight times the number of people. So it was actually a much bigger policy that had more impact than the latest one announced by this government. Did you support that? Ley: Yes, that was a different policy. It’s applied to a balance transfer cap, by the way, it was indexed, and we took it to the election and then we legislated it – and that is the key difference here … The government was so careful to be so definite and prescriptive at the last election about not making any changes to super. I come back to my main point, this is breaking faith with the Australian people. Superannuation has been leading this week’s headlines after the government announced balances above $3m will be taxed at a rate of 30%, up from the current concessional rate of 15%. That change will only affect 0.5% of Australians, but the fact that 60% of that wealthy cohort are men is a reminder how gender impacts how much money Australians have when they retire. The average man will retire with 28% more in his super account that the average woman. The minister for finance and women, Katy Gallagher, is speaking to ABC Radio about what’s being done to bridge the gap between the retirement savings of men and women. The issue of gender equality isn’t just about super in this country. We do have a problem. Women are more educated than men but we work less, earn less, have less savings, less super and assets and women over 60 are the most vulnerable group in the sense of being the highest group moving into the homelessness sector, so there’s a whole range of issues. There’s a couple of things that we’re trying to do. One of the big issues around super is the fact that women earn less. And so closing the gender pay gap is a really important part of that. We’ve got a bill in the parliament right now, which looks to accelerate closing of the gender pay gap, which sits at about 14 or 15%. And then there are the other issues which we’ve made no secret we would like to do when we make room in the budget, which is looking at how we ensure for those gaps in women’s earnings, when they’re on parental leave and things like that, that we pay super. Gallagher says she’d like “to do it now” but points to the constraints of the structural deficit in the budget. I would have liked that it was done 10 years ago. But the reality is we’ve got a $50bn structural deficit, where as far as the eye can see the pressures on the budget aren’t lessening, they’re intensifying. NSW leaders to square off in battleground election debate The election battleground of western Sydney will be the site of a key debate between the premier, Dominic Perrottet, and opposition leader, Chris Minns, as NSW prepares to vote. With latest polls tipping a Labor victory on 25 March, the leaders will square off on Thursday at Rosehill Racecourse to debate important issues in Sydney’s west. Winning the support of the region, home to more than a quarter of the state’s population, will be critical to the success of both parties on polling day, amid cost of living pressures and housing affordability concerns. The event includes a panel discussion with representatives of Western Sydney University, Westpac, global accounting firm PwC and media. It comes as a poll found the cost of living, including food, utilities and housing is the top concern of 50% of voters. The survey, conducted by Resolve Strategic and published in the Sydney Morning Herald today, found most voters did not want new infrastructure funded through privatisation. Just 10% of those surveyed want public assets sold to pay for roads and rail, with 40% say infrastructure projects should be financed by cuts to other services, while 14% thought debt was preferable. The poll of 803 eligible voters found Labor’s primary vote had lifted one percentage point to 38%, while the Coalition’s had dropped two points to 32%. With 93 seats up for grabs, the data points to an overall swing of 7% to Labor – enough to deliver the 47 seats required to form a majority government. - AAP Australia Post will not be privatised, Communications minister says The government is flagging that letters may no longer be delivered five days a week after the release of a discussion paper yesterday. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, spoke to ABC Radio about the state of letters in Australia: Letters are certainly still being sent. But the reality is that 97% of them are actually being sent by business and government, but Australia Post has that obligation. And as long as people want to send letters, those letters will be delivered. Rowland says the discussion paper “absolutely” does not open up the possibility of selling Australia Post off to the private sector, which has happened in other countries: The guiding principles, the very first one, explicitly states that Australia Post will remain in full public ownership. Rowland maintains that the community service obligation to serve as all parts of Australia including rural and remote areas will not be axed despite the $348m price tag last financial year: Australians do expect that they are going to be able to receive their parcels and their letters within a certain timeframe but of course parcels are not part of these performance standards. So that’s precisely what we want to examine through this consultation process. Good morning! Natasha May reporting for blog duty. Residents north of Melbourne were warned to evacuate their homes in the early hours of the morning due to a bushfire. The warning has been downgraded to watch and act for the communities of Bonnie Doon, Fawcett, Maintongoon, Woodfield but emergency services say the fire is not yet under control. VicEmergency warns: There is a bushfire at Stoney Creek Rd, Maintongoon that is not yet under control. Firefighters have been able to slow the spread of fire for now, but the situation can change at any time. You must monitor conditions and be ready to act. Man dies after being hit by cyclist in Sydney A man in his 70s has died after being hit by a cyclist in inner Sydney, Australian Associated Press reports. Emergency services were called to Regent Street, Chippendale, on Wednesday afternoon after reports a pedestrian had been hit, NSW police said. The critically injured man was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to hospital where he died. The rider – a man believed to be in his 40s – was uninjured and police are investigating. Australia Post deliveries rethink In the modern age, should Australia Post still have to deliver letters every day? Under law, the letter service must “reasonably meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of the Australian community”. That’s further defined in regulations as letters being delivered every day (barring weekends and public holidays) to 98% of delivery points – letter boxes, mostly – and 99.7% of delivery points at least two days a week. But with letter volume on a long and inevitable decline (who sends a letter?) that’s a deeply unprofitable business. The government has commissioned a review to ask if our letter service will have to get slower and/or more expensive. Read more here: Good morning and thanks for joining us for our live news blog.

The competition watchdog plans to crack down on companies’ environmental claims after an initial sweep found more than half made misleading statements – dubbed “greenwashing”. A survey of 247 businesses or brands across eight sectors by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission last October that found 57% had promoted “concerning claims about their environmental credentials”. Stuart Robert, who served as human services and government services minister in the Coalition government, will be questioned by the robodebt royal commission in Brisbane today. This follows evidence earlier in the week that the minister told the head of his department to “double down” on robodebt rather than admit fault.

                    "bodyText": "Do you have a personal eruption plan, if you don’t mind me asking? This is the term used to describe how one intends to get away in the event of a volcano going off. Even if you don’t live near one – such as the underwater Kolumbo volcano near Santorini, which has recently been scanned to reveal a filling magma chamber – really big eruptions can have planetary consequences, through the climatic effects of the ash they pump into the atmosphere. Indeed, though we worry more about asteroids or nuclear winter, volcanoes have probably been responsible for more of the abrupt climatic shifts in our species’ history than anything else. Unfortunately, the historian Peter Frankopan writes, “almost no investment of time, planning or funding has been spent on the potential implications of major volcanic eruptions” in our own time. Whoops. So runs one urgent message of this rich and fascinating book, which sets out to tell the story of Homo sapiens from the point of view of how we have suffered natural ecological disasters, and engineered our own in turn. Humanity has survived historical swings in climate more severe than global heating presently threatens, including the “megafloods” that occurred during the thawing of the last ice age (ancestral memory of which arguably inspires the Old Testament and other sacred texts); a volcanic eruption that blotted out much of the sun for a few years in the sixth century might have influenced the Norse myths. Genghis Khan could perhaps thank unusually heavy rains in Mongolia for his military success (they increased the amount of pasture for his horses), but his armies also spread the Black Death everywhere they rampaged. Agriculture in turn has transformed the planet, Frankopan shows, as well as the development of global trade in spices, cotton and enslaved people, and even the transplantation of tomatoes and potatoes from the Americas to Europe. Introducing a disquisition on the latter root, Frankopan does not hesitate to write: “The humble potato changed the world.” This is one of those books that aims to tell the whole story of everything from a cute new angle, so inevitably there are longueurs where the focus on climate is temporarily forgotten and a few pages of potted history or comparative religion take over. A mini-essay on the geopolitics of oil in the 20th century cannot compete with specialist books on the subject, for instance Helen Thompson’s brilliant Disorder, while those interested in the climatic effects of nuclear tests will find more detail in Serhii Plokhy’s Atoms and Ashes. And because every subject is special, it can end up feeling as though none is. “The period up to c3000BC was one marked by considerable ecological and demographic change,” we learn, which is to say that it was, in those respects, exactly like every other period in history. “All around the world,” we learn to not very much surprise later, “the period from c800 to c1200 was one of profound change.” Much of this is speculative, but then so is all narrative writing about the past, even when one is not explicitly doing counterfactual history. Climate change, we are told, “has been suggested” as one reason for the decline of some cities and the growth of others; drought, flood, and disease no doubt often had as powerful an effect as the edicts of kings, if not more so. Still, while a volcanic eruption did not make Cleopatra’s life easier, “other factors explain the sequence of events that ended with the Queen’s death in 30BC”. This kind of hedging is to be applauded, since it is the opposite of what dishonest writers of sweeping nonfiction habitually do, forcing everything to fit their neat scheme. What then shall we do now? The author’s list of potential remedies for our present carbon emissions includes the obvious (clean energy) and the less-often hymned (teach cows to use latrines), some of which we might hope to be as effective as Pope Pius V’s 16th-century excommunication of a plague of locusts in St Peter’s Square. Such measures might, Frankopan hopes, mitigate “the unsustainable way that we live in the twenty-first century”, though no one has ever lived sustainably: they all died. Indeed the book does end up implying that our real problem is, simply, other people. To say, for example, that the “green revolution” of the mid-20th century – the advances in agricultural technology led by Nobel prize-winning Norman Borlaug which, it is usually estimated, saved hundreds of millions from starvation – was “counterproductive” because it didn’t also solve political problems is rather odd. But then there are hints that Frankopan might belong to the more misanthropic end of the green spectrum. He disapproves of cities, which indeed consume many resources and emit much waste, even though living in a city is more energy-efficient than not. Geoengineering – trying to change the climate technologically on a planetary scale – is obviously dangerous, though, and anyway a supervolcano might soon do the same thing for us, only too effectively, with accompanying tsunamis and crop failures. Meanwhile scientists are forecasting the return of El Niño later this year, sending global temperatures “off the chart”. It is hard to feel sunny about all this, and The Earth Transformed ends in a vision not so much pessimistic as quasi-apocalyptic, hoping at the very best for a future Edenic age in which a far smaller number of humans now live in harmony with nature. How such a mass global depopulation is to be achieved in non-murderous ways is left as an exercise for the reader. • The Earth Transformed: An Untold History by Peter Frankopan is published by Bloomsbury (£30).

                    "bodyText": "The United States and other western countries are losing the race with China to develop advanced technologies and retain talent, with Beijing potentially establishing a monopoly in some areas, a new report has said. China leads in 37 of 44 technologies tracked in a year-long project by thinktank the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. The fields include electric batteries, hypersonics and advanced radio-frequency communications such as 5G and 6G. The report, published on Thursday, said the US was the leader in just the remaining seven technologies such as vaccines, quantum computing and space launch systems. It said the findings were based on “high impact” research in critical and emerging technology fields, focusing on papers that were published in top-tier journals and were highly cited by subsequent research. “Our research reveals that China has built the foundations to position itself as the world’s leading science and technology superpower, by establishing a sometimes stunning lead in high-impact research across the majority of critical and emerging technology domains,” the report said. “The critical technology tracker shows that, for some technologies, all of the world’s top 10 leading research institutions are based in China and are collectively generating nine times more high-impact research papers than the second-ranked country (most often the US).” The Chinese Academy of Sciences ranked first or second in most of the 44 technologies included in the tracker, the report added. “We also see China’s efforts being bolstered through talent and knowledge import: one-fifth of its high-impact papers are being authored by researchers with postgraduate training in a Five-Eyes country,” it said, referring to the intelligence-sharing grouping of the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand. “China’s lead is the product of deliberate design and long-term policy planning, as repeatedly outlined by Xi Jinping and his predecessors.” Joe Biden said in his State of the Union address last month that the US was “investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, and that China’s government is intent on dominating”. But the institute said China was at high risk of establishing a monopoly in eight technologies, including nanoscale materials and manufacturing, hydrogen and ammonia for power, and synthetic biology. The report said China’s strides in nuclear-capable hypersonic missiles in 2021 should not have been a surprise to US intelligence agencies “because, according to our data analysis, over the past five years, China generated 48.49% of the world’s high-impact research papers into advanced aircraft engines, including hypersonics, and it hosts seven of the world’s top 10 research institutions in this topic area”. Across the board, the institute also found that there was “a large gap between China and the US, as the leading two countries, and everyone else”. “The data then indicates a small, second-tier group of countries led by India and the UK: other countries that regularly appear in this group-in many technological fields— include South Korea, Germany, Australia, Italy, and less often, Japan,” it said. The research, launched at the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi on Thursday, was conducted by a team led by Jamie Gaida, a senior analyst with the institute’s international cyber policy centre. The institute disclosed that its research was funded by the US state department’s global engagement center and a grant from the Special Competitive Studies Project, a foundation that aims to strengthen America’s long-term competitiveness. The institute also called for democracies to establish large sovereign wealth funds for research, development and innovation in critical technology that they add to each year. It suggests allocating 0.5% to 0.7% of gross national income, with co-investment from industry. It said while sovereign wealth funds should support the most promising programs, governments should also allocate some funds to high-risk, high-reward “moonshot” initiatives."

                    "bodyText": "Kemi Badenoch, the minister for women and equalities, has dismissed a call for the government to pilot menopause leave for women, complaining it was being proposed from “a leftwing perspective”. (See 5.45pm.) Helen Whately, the care minister, has dismissed claims that Matt Hancock ignored scientific advice over Covid tests for care homes. Heather Hallett, the Covid-19 public inquiry’s chair has insisted the investigation will not be a “whitewash”, after the journalist Isabel Oakeshott claimed that concern over the inquiry’s integrity prompted her to publish private messages shared with her by Matt Hancock. Keir Starmer has urged Rishi Sunak to give the Covid inquiry the resources it needs to be able to publish its findings by the end of the year. (See 12.12pm.) Replying to Starmer at PMQs, Sunak said the inquiry had the powers it needed and should be left to get on with its job. David Frost, Boris Johnson’s former Brexit negotiator, has fired a shot at Rishi Sunak’s Northern Ireland protocol deal, admitting it would “help” but would not remove EU law from Northern Ireland. Kemi Badenoch, the minister for women and equalities, has dismissed suggestions that the government should pilot menopause leave for women, complaining it was being proposed from “a leftwing perspective”. She made the comment during bad-tempered exchanges when she was giving evidence to the Commons women and equalities committee, where Labour’s Carolyn Harris asked about a recommendation in a report the committee published last year. The committee urged the government to trial “specific menopause leave so that women are not forced out of work by insensitive and rigid sickness policies”. Badenoch said anyone could carry out a pilot; it did not have not have to be the government. She went on: We spend so much time creating new work for government to do, we spread our attention so thinly, that we miss things. Harris said the government had accepted the committee’s call in the same report for a menopause ambassador to be appointed. She asked why, if a menopause ambassador was not a waste of time, piloting menopause leave was. Badenoch replied: That is something which would require far more resources than encouraging employees in terms of changing their work culture. Arguing that it was a matter of philosophical perspective, she told Harris: You’re speaking from a leftwing perspective on creating something. I’m speaking from centre-right perspective. I think that influences the approach that you take. I do not think that creating another pilot on more leave is what is going to help women who have the menopause. Badenoch, who clashed with Caroline Nokes, the Conservative chair of the committee as well during the hearing, also dismissed the idea that the menopause should be given protected status under equality law. She said: We have so many things that people ask for protected characteristics – carers, single people, having ginger hair, being short, all sorts of things that people ask for as protected characteristics. Creating a new special characteristic for the menopause is a complete misunderstanding of what protected characteristics are, they are immutable characteristics, we have nine of them that cover everyone. The menopause can be dealt with, alongside three existing ones: age, sex, and disability, because it is a health condition and many disabilities are health conditions. This is from the Scotsman’s Alexander Brown. Isabel Oakeshott justified her decision to release Matt Hancock’s WhatsApp messages partly on the grounds that she thinks the official public inquiry into the pandemic will “drag on forever”. (See 10.34am.) She also claimed the inquiry could end up “a colossal whitewash”. The inquiry is already holding preliminary hearings, with lawyers, not witnesses, covering procedural matters, and at the start of a hearing this morning Heather Hallett, the inquiry chair, made a statement specifically rejecting the Oakeshott allegation. She said: This inquiry will not drag on for decades, I have been determined from the outset that the inquiry must reach conclusions, and make recommendations, as soon as possible if we are to achieve our aim of learning lessons, and reducing suffering in any future pandemic. That is why I sought the express agreement of the then prime minister to issue interim reports, and I have given instructions to the module teams that that is what I wish to do whenever possible. However, if we are going to conduct a thorough and effective investigation it will take some time, despite the inquiry team working flat out … I know of no other inquiry of its kind in the world, ie one in public, with statutory powers to obtain evidence, with core participants playing important roles, and with extraordinarily broad terms of reference. So with respect to certain commentators, comparisons to other countries are unhelpful. Furthermore, I wish to emphasise there will be no whitewash. My colleague Jim Waterson has written an excellent profile of Isabel Oakeshott, the journalist who has turned over Matt Hancock. Here is an extract. As Robert Colvile, the director of the rightwing Centre for Policy Studies thinktank and co-author of the 2019 Tory manifesto, said: “The main lesson I’ve learned from this is not to hire someone who absolutely hates your signature policy as your ghostwriter.” One political journalist said: “The man needs his head testing to have gone near Oakeshott with a flaming trebuchet, let alone a bargepole.” Extraordinarily Oakeshott handed the entire archive of Hancock’s messages to the Daily Telegraph despite being paid a rumoured six-figure salary by Rupert Murdoch’s News UK to be a pundit on its struggling TalkTV channel. Staff at the Sun and the Times have been left fuming that they are now trying to follow up a story given to a rival newspaper by one of their own employees – while TalkTV has missed out on a scoop that could have helped it in its ratings battle with GB News. And here is the full article. The Daily Telegraph has published more extracts from what it calls its “lockdown files” (ie, Matt Hancock’s WhatsApp collection). It says that Boris Johnson proposed giving over-65s a choice over whether they could shield, and that Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, and Prof Sir Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, both highlighted the disadvantages with shielding. The Telegraph reports: The government’s most senior scientific advisers told the prime minister that the implementation of shielding measures was not “very effective” – but ministers still asked 2.2 million people to follow them for months, The Telegraph can disclose. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, said in a WhatsApp message in Aug 2020 that shielding implementation – which required people who were clinically “extremely vulnerable” to isolate – had not been “easy or very effective”. Professor Sir Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, added that he would personally “think twice” about following shielding guidelines himself, unless it was to protect the NHS – which was not their principal aim. Both stories are interesting, but don’t fundamentally shift our understanding of what was happening within government as it grappled with government. What is much more engrossing, though, is the opportunity to read the WhatsApp threads exchanged by ministers at the time. It is like being able to eavesdrop on a private conversation, and WhatsApp messages can reveal more about character than what gets said in public. The Telegraph is embedding the threads in their news stories. For example, here is one from Boris Johnson, after he read a figure in the Financial Times that made him think official fatality rate figures for Covid were wrong. This was sent to what seems to be a small group of Johnson’s top advisers who then proceeded to explain to him what the official figures said. Vallance worked out the problem, which was that the FT figure was misleading. Boris Johnson clutching at straws to validate his anti-lockdown instincts, Vallance and Whitty explaining the facts patiently and deferentially, Dominic Cummings whacking the media – it’s all there. Kate Forbes, the Scottish government’s finance secretary, has rejected suggestions that she would abandon the SNP’s “progresssive agenda” if she were to become party leader and next first minister. Yesterday Humza Yousaf, the health secretary, said “the SNP has managed to gain support to dizzying heights because of the progressive agenda that we have”. This was taken as a jibe at Forbes, whose campaign has been badly damaged by her declaration that she is personally opposed to equal marriage, and the gender recognition bill, for faith reasons. Asked about the comment at a campaign event today, Forbes said she agreed with Yousaf and that her plans did not involve a shift away from progressive ideas. She said: I think it is very progressive to believe in the inherent dignity and humanity of every human being in Scotland and to ensure that when they need care, and when they need medical assistance, they can access that free at the point of need. If we’re serious about eradicating poverty, which I am, if we’re serious about reinvesting in our public services, which I am, then we need a growing an prosperous economy. You cannot eradicate poverty and reinvest in our public services at the level that we need to if we don’t have a growing and prosperous economy. This is about profits with purpose. It’s about a growing economy with a view to reducing poverty in Scotland and reinvesting in our public services. Sinn Féin has said there is “no time to waste” in implementing the PM’s deal on the Northern Ireland protocol. At a press conference at Stormont with Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn Féin president, where they both encouraged the DUP to resume power sharing, Michelle O’Neill, the party’s leader in Northern Ireland and first minister designate, said: I rarely find myself agreeing with the British prime minister, but I do think that the opportunity we now have of access to both markets has to be grabbed on to with both hands, and there is no time to waste because we’re about to attend in Washington DC a number of events that will be to celebrate St Patrick’s Day, but as you all know, that’s about encouraging investment here, that’s about the economic potential of here. We have in quick succession a deal being done on the protocol, we go to the States next week to celebrate St Patrick’s Day, very quickly in the aftermath of that comes the anniversary of the Good Friday agreement. The economic potential for us here is enormous and this is a moment not to be missed. Power sharing has been suspended for more than a year because the DUP started a boycott until the protocol was reformed. The party is deciding whether or not to back the new version negotiated by Sunak, and it says it won’t be rushed as it makes up its mind. (See 11.56am.) To implement the protocol deal, the UK-EU joint committee has to approve the changes, and then the UK and the EU need to make legislative changes. Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy prime minister, used a statement in the Commons to announce that the government will “legislate as soon as possible to introduce an independent public advocate to put victims and the bereaved at the heart of our response to large-scale public disasters”. This is something that has been promised by the government for years, in response to complaints from victims and their relatives that at public inquiries into events like the Hillsborough disaster they did not get proper representation equivalent to the support available to bodies facing criticism, like the police. The advocate’s office will support victims “right from the immediate aftermath of a tragedy until all inquiries and inquests have concluded”, the Ministry of Justice said. Raab said: The independent public advocate goes some way to making good on this government’s longstanding promise to ensure that pain, that suffering of the Hillsborough victims and other victims is never repeated again. I can tell the house it will be passed into law, it will be made up of a panel of experts to guide survivors and the bereaved in the aftermath of a major disaster. Here is the MoJ news release. At the post-PMQs lobby briefing the PM’s press secretary said that Rishi Sunak has had “a good discussion” with Boris Johnson about the deal to revise the Northern Ireland protocol. She did not give details. But she did say Sunak thought Tory MPs should be given time to consider the merits of the deal. The PM believes that it’s right that colleagues across the house have the time to reflect and go through the details of the agreement. It is thought that Johnson still resents the part Sunak played in forcing his resignation, by resigning as chancellor, and there was speculation that Johnson would lead a Tory revolt against the deal. Last week Johnson said that a better strategy would have been for the government to just carry on with the Northern Ireland protocol bill. But Johnson has not said a word in public about the deal since it was published on Monday and, with Tory opposition to the plan appearing to evaporate, Johnson has been left with the problem that he cannot spearhead a rebellion that does not exist. At the Downing Street post-PMQs lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson defended the use of WhatsApp by ministers for government business. He said: The rules set out that ministers are able to discuss government businesses over text messages or WhatsApp, that’s entirely within the rules, understandably part and parcel of modern government. The requirement is that substantive decisions are communicated to the Cabinet Office. Families who lost loved ones to Covid-19 “more than ever need to have a full understanding” of what records the public inquiry into the pandemic was requesting in the wake of reports based on WhatsApp messages sent by Matt Hancock, a legal counsel for bereaved relatives has said. The families needed to have the ability to assist identifying any gaps in the disclosure of documents and messages, Anna Morris KC told the inquiry, which also heard a call from a lawyer representing Scottish families for clarification that Hancock had disclosed the messages which have recently been leaked. Morris, who represents Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said: The families deserve to be in the inquiry circle of trust. They do not deserve to be left reeling from media revelations regarding documentation that I’m sure your team will agree is clearly within the scope. She said that the families were pleased to hear counsel for the inquiry say on Wednesday morning that others with relevant evidence were being requested to come forward, but the relatives also expected that this request would be followed by “rule nine” letters, which direct that recipients provide written evidence. Morris also pressed the inquiry to plan for the risk that there could be potential witnesses who would, in her words, “be reluctant to engage with the full scrutiny of the inquiry, and who may choose instead to hide the lie and hide a reliance on parliamentary privilege”. She went on: One can think of examples of parliamentarians who, when faced with statements made outside of parliament or on WhatsApp messages which conflict with what was said within parliament, may decline to repeat in a witness statement what they did state on the record in parliament and claim that there is no requirement that they do so using parliamentary privilege as a justification. This is likely to be a live issue and soon. The social care UQ is over. Richard Tice, leader of Reform UK, the successor to the Brexit party which is challenging the Tory party from the right, is the partner of Isabel Oakeshott, the journalist behind the release of WhatsApp messages being used by the Telegraph to criticise Matt Hancock. Tice and Oakeshott are both strong critics of the government’s lockdown policy, which they believe was too restrictive, and in an interview with GB News this morning Tice said the Telegraph revelations were justified because the public was not told the truth about what happened. He said: It’s really important that the public understand the extent to which our politicians didn’t tell us the truth all the way through these lockdowns and the consequences of that. You remember those words, ‘we’re making the right decisions based on the best science at the right time’? Well, it turned out that wasn’t the case. Very often they were making decisions to suit their own political expediency and ignoring some of the right advice and completely refusing to look at advice from other people. The reality is that these messages, they proved what we feared, those of us who were sceptical of the lockdowns and the merits of them, we feared what was going on. Tice also said he was not confident the inquiry would uncover the truth. He said: Our real concern here is that the inquiry will turn out to be literally a whitewash and establishment cover-up to show that everybody did the best thing and that simply isn’t the truth and people deserve it. The people deserve the truth. Aaron Bell (Con) accuses Labour of being “opportunistic” in the way they are attacking the government’s Covid policy “with hindsight”. Whately says he is “100% right”. Kieran Mullan (Con) claims Labour has misled the public about the government’s record on handling the pandemic. He says Labour should apologise for that. Labour said the UK had the worst death toll in Europe, but its record wasn’t the worst, and was broadly in line with France’s and Germany’s, he says. Whately agrees. She says the country needs to reflect on what happened. Whately says, if Labour was in power, she is sure that, like the government, it would have tried to make the best decisions in the light of the information available. Daisy Cooper (Lib Dem) why Jacob Rees-Mogg was able to get a Covid test sent to his home by courier when there was a national shortage of tests. Whately says she needed a test for her family, and used the same app as everyone else. Peter Bone (Con) says Labour wants to rewrite history. At the time people did not know what was right or wrong. One of Matt Hancock’s messages said: “Tell me if I’m wrong.” He says the Covid inquiry must consider this. But can it report earlier? Whateley says at the time there was “a huge amount of uncertainty”. As for the timing of the inquiry, that is not under the control of ministers, she says. Sir Oliver Heald (Con) says what was are seeing today is “trial by media”. Whately agrees. She says the public inquiry should be allowed to do its job. Whately is responding to Kendall. She says the government had to limit testing at first. The courts have backed the decisions taken by the government about whom to prioritise, she says. She says the WhatsApp messages that have been published are selective. Advice was given in other places. The evidence has been given to the inquiry, she says. She quotes from an email sent after the WhatsApp exchanges reported by the Telegraph saying everyone going into care home should be tested “as capacity allows”. Ministers did all they could to protect people, including the most vulnerable, she says. UPDATE: Whately said: I think it’s relatively easy for [Kendall] to come to House today and make these highly political points. And knowing actually how she and I worked together in the pandemic and she and I talked about all that we were doing to look after people in care homes, I am, as I say, shocked and disappointed in the tone that she has taken today when we are dealing with extremely serious questions. There’s very selective information that she is basing her comments on. [She] knows how the government and me personally strained every sinew, worked day and night, did everything in our power to help people and specifically the most vulnerable during the pandemic. Liz Kendall, the shadow social care minister, asks why Matt Hancock ignored medical advice to test all people going into care homes. She says relatives of people who died will be “appalled” by his attempt to rewrite history. UPDATE: Kendall said: Former ministers are touring the studios this morning claiming this delay was simply because there weren’t enough tests. Where is the evidence for this? And even if tests were in short supply, why weren’t care home residents prioritised when the devastating impact of Covid was there for all to see? The families of the 43,000 care home residents who lost their lives will be appalled at the former health secretary attempting to rewrite history, an attempt that will turn to ashes along with his TV career. We need more humility and less celebrity from the member for West Suffolk and above all we need answers. Helen Whately, the health minister, is responding to the urgent question. She says Matt Hancock set ambitious targets for testing. “The importance of testing was never in doubt, and there was full agreement on that in every part of government,” she says. But she says at the start the government did not have the capacity to do mass testing. The government built the largest testing capacity in Europe, she says. She says “selective snippets” of WhatsApp conversations give a “limited and at times misleading” impression as to what happened. That was an unremarkable and easily forgettable PMQs. Neither Keir Starmer nor Rishi Sunak were particularly on form and, among the party leaders, Stephen Flynn probably did best, with a zinger of a question on Brexit. (See 12.16pm.) Starmer adopted a scattergun approach, going from one issue to another. His questions, crafted to make a point rather than elicit an answer, were fine, but none of them were particularly new or powerful, and because he was trying to cover so much ground, it meant that it was hard to know what his main point was. At least a couple of times Sunak responded by avoiding the question altogether. Some of his retorts were reasonably effective in debating terms, but he did not “land” a serious message overall. CCHQ is trying hard at the moment to argue that Labour’s policy programme is just a catalogue of “unfunded commitments”. At the election, this will be an important debate. But the CCHQ material is not really getting an audience at all, at the moment. As Starmer pointed out, after the mini-budget, CCHQ has lost credibility on this issue. Keir Starmer has received a surprise endorsement from Isabel Oakeshott. Joanna Cherry (SNP) says she and Sunak have both had to sort out consitutional messes caused by Boris Johnson. Sunak said Northern Ireland would benefit from being in the EU single market. If NI can have a special status, why can’t Scotland have one? Sunak says Scotland has a special status – “inside the United Kingdom”. Craig Tracey (Con) asks if stopping illegal crossings remains a piority? Sunak says the government must do more. “As soon as the legislation is ready” it will be published, he says. Cat Smith (Lab) asks about a hosptial supposed to be one of the government’s “40 new hospitals”. But no development is happening, she says. Sunak says, as well as the 40 hospitals, there are 90 upgrades. The government is backing the NHS, he says. Sarah Champion (Lab) says 79 people have been killed on smart motorways. She says the government is still rolling them out. They are “death trap roads”. Why is that justified? Sunak says last year the rollout was paused. Safety is a priority, he says. Virginia Crosbie (Con) asks if the government will develop more nuclear power. Sunak says the govenrment is committed to more nuclear power plants, and that Crosbie’s constituency, Ynys Môn, would make a good site for a development. Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, says Sunak said yesterday access to the single market was special, exciting and attractive. Why is Sunak denying it to the rest of the country. Sunak says it is disappointing that Flynn is playing politics with this. Northern Ireland has a special place in the UK. Flynn says Sunak was more positive about the single market than Keir Starmer. What the prime minister said yesterday is that EU single market access will be a good thing for business. Now of course that’s in contrast to the leader of the Labour party who said in December, that EU single market access would not boost economic growth. Does it hurt the prime minister to know that the Labour party believe in Brexit more than he does? Sunak says this is about getting the right mechanisms in place for Northern Ireland, not about the macro issues around Brexit. Philip Dunne (Con) welcomes the deal on the NI protocol, and asks if the UK will rejoin the Horizon programme. Sunak says the UK will continue to work with the EU on a range of areas. Starmer says the sight of politicians writing books about Covid, or leaking messages, will be “insulting” and a “ghoulish spectacle” to many people. Will the Covid inquiry get the resources it needs to report by the end of this year? Families across the country will look at this, and the sight of politicians writing books portraying them as heroes will be an insulting and ghoulish spectacle for them. Sunak says it is an independent inquiry. He says, as a lawyer, Starmer should know the importance of due process. MPs should let it do its work, he says. Rather than comment on piecemeal bits of information, I’m sure the honourable gentleman will agree with me the right way for these things to be looked at is the Covid inquiry. There is a proper process to these things, it is an independent inquiry, it has the resources it needs, it has the powers it needs and what we should do in this House is to let them get on and do their job. Starmer says abolishing non-dom status could release more money for childcare. Sunak says Labour has already spent the money it claims it would raise from its non-dom policy five times. Starmer says Sunak introduced a tax, and Shell has not paid a penny. “Fantastic work.” The Tories said they would build more homes. But the Tories shelved housing reform. Will he bring them back, or duck that fight? Sunak says the number of first-time buyers is at its highest level for 20 years. He says Labour would ban new energy developments in the North Sea. That would mean more imports, which would be bad for the economy. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, points out that the question was about house building. He jokingly suggests that was due to the noise, and Sunak not hearing the question. Starmer says CEO surveys show they think only Labour has a plan for the economy, and only the Tories broke the economy. Why won’t the government close the loopholes in the windfall tax? Sunak says he introduced the windfall tax. “I have got good news for him – we did it a year ago.” Starmer says the definition of unfunded promises was the Tory kamikaze budget last autumn. Who will pay for higher gas prices? Families, or energy companies. Sunak makes a jibe about Starmer going to Davos, and says a CEO survey shows businesses rate the UK as a place to invest. Keir Starmer says the average family in Britain will be poorer than the average family in Poland by 2030. That is shocking, he says. Starmer made a speech on this on Monday. Sunak says the energy crisis has the biggest impact on living standards. He lists what the government is doing on that. He accuses Labour of making unfunded commitments. Tom Randall (Con) asks about a hospital development plan in Gedling. Sunak says the government is committed to a new hospital in Randall’s constituency. Justin Madders (Lab) asks Sunak why he is not backing Labour’s plan to double the number of places at medical school. Sunak says Madders should “keep up”. The government does have an NHS workforce plan, he says. Rishi Sunak starts by wishing people a happy St David’s day. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. PMQs is about to start. Sammy Wilson, the DUP’s chief whip, has said that he thinks the Stormont brake – the mechanism at the heart of Rishi Sunak’s deal to revise the Northern Ireland protocol – will turn out to be “fairly ineffective”. On Monday Sunak told MPs that the brake was “a powerful new safeguard” that would allow Stormont to block new EU laws. But Wilson told Times Radio this morning: Let’s not underestimate the fact that when the EU introduces new laws in the future, it will have an impact on Northern Ireland. And the point of the brake was meant to be to give a means for unionists to oppose that. I think it will have to be used on lots of occasions, though I suspect to be fairly ineffective. Wilson also said the DUP would not be rushed into deciding whether or not to back the new deal. Asked how long the party would take to come to a decision, he said: As long as it takes us to get, first of all, the analysis, and secondly, the answers from the government, before we make that decision, that’s the time we’ll take. But the one thing I’ll say to you is that we will not have a knee-jerk reaction to this deal. It means too much to us. And we have got to give it real consideration. At the end of the day, we will then come to a conclusion, is this a deal which safeguards the union that safeguards our economy? If it’s not, then we’ll reject it, if we come to a conclusion on balance it does, then we’ll accept it. Lord Bethell, who served as a health minister when Matt Hancock was health secretary and is a personal friend, was on the Today programme this morning defending him. Here are the main points. Bethell said Hancock should publish all his WhatsApp messages so that people can judge for themselves whether he acted properly. Bethell said: I certainly think Matt should just publish his WhatsApps and get them out there. Clearly that ship has sailed and I’m very proud of what’s in many of those messages. I think the listeners will see them and admire the effort and hard work that people put into our pandemic response. He said, although the Telegraph reporting implied that Hancock and other ministers conducted important government business via WhatsApp, that was not correct. He said: Formal decision-making is done through paperwork, and we don’t have that in front of us. And that’s why this partial glimpse into the decision-making is so unfortunate because it gives a misleading impression. He said Hancock said the guidance should only mandate testing for people entering care homes from hospital at an early stage in the pandemic because it was not possible to test everyone else. Bethell said: The reality was there was a very, very limited number of those tests … The thing that held us back was not a dispute about the clinical advice. It was simply the operational ability to deliver tests. Bethell described Isabel Oakeshott as “a terrific journalist” but “not a very good friend”. He said that he had deleted messages from his own phone relating to the PPE contracts, and the so-called VIP lane, because his phone was short of space for data. He said: I don’t think that’s odd. Listen, I had an issue with capacity on my phone and there simply wasn’t enough space on my phone for all the WhatsApp messages and I clumsily deleted them. In retrospect, I regret doing that but that isn’t the sign of a conspiracy… there wasn’t a great conspiracy behind these arrangements. The Scottish National party have come in for heavy criticism over lack of transparency after it emerged officials were planning to hold all nine leadership hustings without media access or live-streaming, as a media-free “safe-space” for party members. All three candidates running to replace Nicola Sturgeon as SNP leader – Ash Regan, Kate Forbes and Humza Yousaf – backed calls to allow media access on Tuesday afternoon, as broadcasters and print journalists came together to challenge the decision amidst fierce criticism from opposition parties. The party has now said it is working with media outlets, though it remains unclear how the first hustings, taking place in Cumbernauld tonight, will be managed. The SNP has suggested that one representative from print, television and radio could attend, on a pooled basis. If Matt Hancock wants to defend his record on care homes, he will get a chance in the Commons at 12.30pm, because Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, has granted an urgent question on the topic. Liz Kendall, the shadow care minister, has tabled the question. A health minister will respond. Hancock is just a backbencher now, but he can ask a question if he wants and, although questions are meant to be very short, Hancock might get some leeway to go on a bit given that he is leading the news at the moment. After that there are two statements: one from Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, on an independent public advocate; and another from Andrew Mitchell, the development minister, on aid to Turkey and Syria. Tory Brexiters can normally spot what they see as a surrender to Brussels in the blink of an eye. But the European Research Group’s so-called “star chamber” of lawyers could take up to a fortnight to scrutinise Rishi Sunak’s Northern Ireland protocol deal, Mark Francois said today. Francois, the ERG chair, told TalkTV that he expected the “star chamber” to produce an assessment “within a fortnight” but he said there was no deadline. He told the station: It takes as long as it takes because it’s very important all this. But I think Sir Bill [Cash] and his team are going to try and do this if they can within a fortnight and as I say they will make their conclusions publicly available for all to see. But because of the importance of this, if it takes a little bit longer than that, then it takes a little bit longer. Francois also said an “important consideration” would be whether the EU would be able to retaliate if the UK were to use the Stormont brake. In December last year Isabel Oakeshott wrote an article for the Spectator about co-writing Matt Hancock’s Pandemic Diaries with him in which she said he was “surprisingly inclined to disclosure”. Hancock did not keep a real diary during the pandemic, and so the book, which is written in diary form, was compiled with extensive reference to contemporary records, including WhatsApp messages. She said that she did not expect him to reveal everything, but that he “shared far more than I could ever have imagined”. Hancock, of course, will be bitterly regretting their collaboration now that Oakeshott has decided to share the material with Daily Telegraph, and, via the paper, the world at large. In an article explaining why she has done so, she says that the public deserves to know the truth about what happened and that the public inquiry is going to take too long. She says: Announced in May 2021, our public inquiry – which has already cost up to £85 million – has yet to begin formal hearings. Alarmingly, it does not appear to have any specific timeframe or deadline. We all know what this means – it will drag on forever. After all, the investigation into Bloody Sunday took 10 years and was nowhere near as daunting a task. The hopelessly open-ended nature of the formal process makes these WhatsApp files all the more important. Amid the ever-present threat of another pandemic, perhaps more deadly than the last, we emphatically cannot afford to wait until the mid-2030s or even beyond to learn lessons. Those who have information in the public interest need to put it out there right now. The Telegraph’s first story from the document trove accuses Hancock of ignoring medical advice on care homes. In her article Oakeshott barely mentions this, and that might be because she thinks that broadly what he did was right. In her Spectator article in December she set out what she learned about the rights and wrongs of the government’s Covid policy when researching the book, and this is what she said about care homes. Hancock is more sensitive about this subject than any other. The accusation that he blithely discharged Covid-positive patients from hospitals into care homes, without thinking about how this might seed the virus among the frail elderly, or attempting to stop this happening, upsets and exasperates him. The evidence I have seen is broadly in his favour. At the beginning of the pandemic, it was simply not possible to test everyone: neither the technology nor the capacity existed. Internal communications show that care homes were clearly instructed to isolate new arrivals. It later emerged that the primary source of new infection in these settings was in any case not hospital discharges, but the movement of staff between care homes. Politically, this was very inconvenient: Hancock knew he would be accused of ‘blaming’ hardworking staff if he emphasised the link (which is exactly what has now happened). He is on less solid ground in relation to the treatment of isolated care-home residents and their increasingly desperate relatives. His absolute priority was to preserve life – however wretched the existence became. Behind the scenes, the then care home minister Helen Whately fought valiantly to persuade him to ease visiting restrictions to allow isolated residents some contact with their loved ones. She did not get very far. Internal communications reveal that the authorities expected to find cases of actual neglect of residents as a result of the suspension of routine care-home inspections. Boris Johnson’s supporters are increasingly doubtful he could make a comeback as prime minister after being “humiliated” over his post-Brexit deal with the EU, my colleague Aubrey Allegretti reports. He has filed a very thorough story on this which you can read here. Steven Swinford has written a similar story for the Times. He has been tweeting about it this morning. Lord Frost, Boris Johnson’s former Brexit negotiator has fired a shot at Rishi Sunak’s Northern Ireland protocol deal, admitting it will “help” but will not remove EU law from Northern Ireland, my colleague Lisa O’Carroll reports. Frost made his comments in a column in the Daily Telegraph. Here’s an excerpt. Most of our political class is choosing not to look too closely at any of this because they are tired of the whole problem. Some even argue, as the prime minister did yesterday, that it is actually better for Northern Ireland to be subject to the Protocol than fully part of the UK. But just as some overclaiming by Boris Johnson in 2019 came back to haunt him, so it will for Rishi Sunak in 2023, because moving goods to Belfast will still not really be like moving goods to Birmingham. A fairer statement of the position would be “this deal softens the application of the Protocol, but does not remove it. It’s the best we could persuade the EU to do because we weren’t prepared to use the protocol bill and the EU knew it”. That doesn’t mean the deal shouldn’t go ahead. It will help. But it won’t remove the underlying tensions, even if the DUP does decide to go back into Stormont. It leaves the government still only partly sovereign over all its territory. Just as in 2019, that is a bitter pill to swallow. Good morning. Covid has soared backed to the top of the news agenda, after the Daily Telegraph published a front page story claiming Matt Hancock ignored medical advice on testing people going into care homes in the early days of the pandemic, when he was health secretary. Hancock says the story is “completely wrong”, based on a partial use of confidential material that is in effect stolen, and published to support the Telegraph’s anti-lockdown agenda. Hancock is also considering suing the paper for libel. Here is the key allegation from the Telegraph’s splash. Matt Hancock rejected the chief medical officer’s advice to test for Covid all residents going into English care homes, leaked messages seen by The Telegraph reveal. Prof Sir Chris Whitty told the then health secretary early in April 2020, about a month into the pandemic, that there should be testing for “all going into care homes”. But Mr Hancock did not follow that guidance, telling his advisers that it “muddies the waters”. Instead, he introduced guidance that made testing mandatory for those entering care homes from hospital, but not for those coming from the community. Prior to the guidance, care homes had been told that negative tests were not required even for hospital patients. The guidance stating that those coming in from the community should be tested was eventually introduced on Aug 14. In response, a spokesperson for Hancock said that the guidance only mandated testing for people entering care homes from hospital because the capacity was not available to test people entering care homes from the community as well at that point. The spokesperson said: Having not been approached in advance by the Telegraph, we have reviewed the messages overnight. The Telegraph intentionally excluded reference to a meeting with the testing team from the WhatsApp. This is critical, because Matt was supportive of Chris Whitty’s advice, held a meeting on its deliverability, told it wasn’t deliverable, and insisted on testing all those who came from hospitals. The Telegraph have been informed that their headline is wrong, and Matt is considering all options available to him. The spokesperson also accused the Telegraph of attacking him to promote the paper’s anti-lockdown agenda. The spokesperson said: It is outrageous that this distorted account of the pandemic is being pushed with partial leaks, spun to fit an anti-lockdown agenda, which would have cost hundreds of thousands of lives if followed. What the messages do show is a lot of people working hard to save lives. The full documents have already all been made available to the inquiry, which is the proper place for an objective assessment, so true lessons can be learned. Those who argue there shouldn’t have been a lockdown ignore the fact that half a million people would have died had we not locked down. And for those saying we should never lock down again, imagine if a disease killed half those infected, and half the population were going to get infected - as is happening right now with avian flu in birds. If that disease were in humans, of course we’d want to lockdown. The story spun on care homes is completely wrong. What the messages show is that Mr Hancock pushed for testing of those going into care homes when that testing was available. Instead of spinning and leaks we need the full, comprehensive inquiry, to ensure we are as well prepared as we can be for the next pandemic, whenever it comes. The Telegraph story is wrong, based on partial, spun leaks – and they did not approach Matt before publication. The Telegraph obtained its material from Isabel Oakeshott, the journalist who co-authored his Pandemic Diaries. She was shown his WhatsApp messages subject to a non-disclosure agreement, but she has said it is in the public interest for them to be be published. This is not the first time she has turned against someone having collaborated with them on a book; it happened to Arron Banks, the Ukip and Leave.EU donor whose Brexit memoirs she ghost wrote. What makes this story particularly concerning, not just for Hancock but for the government as a whole, is that it is not a one-off. The Telegraph says that it has more than 100,000 WhatsApp messages from Hancock and that it will be publishing a series of revelations from them in the coming days. It has set up a dedicated web page to the story – always a worrying development, as those caught up in its MPs’ expenses investigation will recall. I will post more on this through the day. But we have also got PMQs, and ongoing discussion about the Northern Ireland protocol deal. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.15am: Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy PM, gives evidence to the Lords constitutional affairs committee. 12pm: Rishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs. 2.45pm: Kemi Badenoch gives evidence to the Commons women and equalities committee in her capacity as minister for women and equalities. (She is also business secretary.) I’ll try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow. Alternatively, you can email me at andrew.sparrow@theguardian.com."

                    "bodyText": "The Clash – This Is England The last great Clash song: an unlikely, stately, sad synth ballad about the state of a nation – a state seemingly unchanged since 1985 – full of racial violence, police obliviousness to public distress, and “human factory farms”. Yet still, thanks to the crashing power chords of the chorus, there might be some grain of hope left. Slowthai – Nothing Great About Britain If the new king wants to know how many of his subjects live, he could do worse than ask Slowthai to explain about whiteys, asbos, skunk and unending tension: “Three lions, real McCoy, you’re EDL, real English boys / St George’s flag, Doc Marten, boy.” He may be a little surprised by the closing message to the monarchy, though: “I will treat you with the utmost respect / Only if you respect me a little bit, Elizabeth” – dropping a C-bomb thereafter. Gerry Cinnamon – Hope Over Fear King Charles loves Scotland. Loves it so much he’s written children’s books about it. Loves it so much he wears a kilt. Loves it so much he wants to be its king. But he might wish to check in with the official Voice of Young Scotland about how much he is wanted in the Highlands. “Are you happy that nuclear weapons are dumped on the Clyde?” he sings, “Fighting wars for the wealth of the few, how many have died?” Riz MC – Englistan It’s enough to make one feel sorry for Charles, should he survey Britain’s musical landscape: is this really the Britain he is to rule? Riz MC – the nom de rap of actor Riz Ahmed – offers no consolation as he surveys the version of England he lives in: “Pigs hit kids, so / Bricks hit windows and the high street burns.” His diagnosis of the English condition – “politeness mixed with violence” – holds true for the monarchy, too. Dua Lipa – Levitating A reminder of what a productive modern Britain might look like: the child of refugees from one of the nations more demonised by the British right – Albania – becomes one of the world’s biggest pop stars by the simple expedient of being really, really good at it. Meritocracy in action, for a change. Sex Pistols – God Save the Queen It does no harm to offer a reminder that the monarchy has long been a symbol of something other than national unity – that to lots of people it represents a backwards repressiveness that is deeply engrained in British culture. Charles would doubtless profess that there’s nothing he wants less than to make you “a moron, a potential H-bomb”, but he might pause to wonder why so many feel disdain for the institutions of the crown. PJ Harvey – The Words That Maketh Murder The monarch serves also as commander-in-chief of the United Kingdom’s armed forces, and rare is the ruler who hasn’t had a chest emblazoned with scores of medals to recognise their status. What lies behind military medals? Bravery, suffering, death. The Words That Maketh Murder is a reminder that soldiering is not just putting on a show at Horse Guards Parade: “I’ve seen and done things I want to forget,” Harvey sings. “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat.” Joy Crookes – 19th Floor The king has very publicly complained about the redevelopment of our cities – about the “monstrous carbuncles” replacing his beloved classical facades. He pays less attention, perhaps, to the people who inhabit buildings. Joy Crookes’ song is a reminder that even 19 storeys up, there are communities, and that every piece of renewal and gentrification guts what came before. Fairport Convention – Matty Groves Finally, he’ll probably like an old folk song, played by middle-class people. Except Matty Groves speaks directly to our present: class, misogyny, “honour” killings, sexual compulsion – they’re all in here. Charles might seem to be longing for less complicated times, but the times were never uncomplicated unless you were rich enough to iron out the kinks. The Kinks – Autumn Almanac Speaking of which, sometimes one wants to flee the present and wrap oneself in nostalgia for a barely remembered past. And for those times, Autumn Almanac exists – the sweetest, loveliest of Ray Davies songs, hymning a Britain of making do and taking small pleasures: “I like my football on a Saturday / Roast beef on Sundays, all right / I go to Blackpool for my holidays, sit in the open sunlight.” Finally, the kind of subject Charles wants!"

Before we go, let’s recap the big headlines: December quarter GDP expanded by a slower-than-expected 0.5%, while January’s consumer prices rose 7.4% year-on-year – pointing to a slowdown in recent price rises. While the treasurer Jim Chalmers hailed the GDP figures as stronger than all of the G7, he warned the year ahead is “even more unpredictable” than 2022. Anthony Albanese ruled out changes to capital gains concessions on family homes as the Coalition continued its attacks on Labor’s planned changes to how superannuation is taxed. The federal government said Peter Dutton’s comments on what submarines Australia would favour ahead of an impending Aukus announcement were “incredibly irresponsible”. The opposition leader backed Liberal moderate Bridget Archer to stay with the party following reports she may face a preselection push. And ABC staff have voted to take protected industrial action for the first time in 17 years over what they say is a poor pay offer from ABC management. Queensland public hospital waiting times blow out From AAP: The number of Queensland patients waiting longer than clinically recommended to see a specialist in public hospitals has surged more than 80% to 104,000 in a year, according to the state’s auditor general. The Queensland Audit Office also revealed ambulances lost 134,155 hours waiting to transfer patients into hospitals in 2021/22, a rise of more than 20% over the previous year. Auditor general Brendan Worrall’s report revealed outpatient services and ambulances are being hampered because the health system had reduced capacity to meet growing demand. Worrall said the rising demand is due to Queensland having the fastest population growth in the nation, an ageing population, an increase in complex emergency presentations and mental health conditions and the impacts of Covid-19. The health minister, Yvette D’Ath, indicated the suspension of elective surgeries by national cabinet in 2020 and Covid-19’s impact contributed to delays in specialist wait times. “We are investing significantly to lift up that recovery,” she said on Wednesday. Eunice Wright was nine years old when she and her siblings were snatched from their home by police and thrown in a cell for the night. With her mother in hospital with tuberculosis and father away at work, the wider family rallied to have the children returned, but instead they became members of the stolen generation. Australia will co-sponsor Vanuatu’s historic bid for the international court of justice to rule on the climate crisis, including the legal consequences for causing significant environmental harm. The Pacific island country will soon put a resolution to the UN general assembly seeking an opinion on the international legal obligations that countries have to act on the climate crisis. Parliamentary inquiry told children being exposed to gambling via video game loot boxes Video games such as Fortnite are exposing children to gambling and increasing their risk of addiction via “manipulative” in-game purchases known as loot boxes, AAP has reported. That’s what a parliamentary inquiry into online gambling was told on Wednesday, with one researcher suggesting the games were taking “the absence of opportunities for real winnings to another level”. Loot boxes, which feature in many video games, are a sealed mystery box players can either win or buy, and contain in-game items like costumes or weapons. Consumer Policy Research Centre’s Chandni Gupta said research showed a link between purchasing loot boxes and developing a gambling addiction, even in children. “There is little to no transparency on what is offered, how real money is converted to digital currency and also the randomness and design of loot boxes,” she told the inquiry. “People are being manipulated to use real money which is converted into arbitrary digital currency for random digital content.” The centre’s Erin Turner said they represented an “unequal transaction”. “A business has quite significantly superior knowledge about an individual’s behaviour, their gaming behaviour, and a lot of data about how they’re engaging with the game that can be used to manipulate them,” she told the inquiry. “I also don’t know how my behaviour ... can be used against me to try to encourage purchases and push me over the edge.” Controversial ParentsNext welfare scheme should be abolished, inquiry finds The controversial ParentsNext welfare program would be abolished and replaced by a new service that dials down mutual obligations and offers cash incentives for parents, under the recommendations of a parliamentary committee. A select committee inquiring into the billion-dollar employment services system has called for sweeping changes to the Coalition’s $484m ParentsNext scheme, which has faced criticism from welfare advocates and women’s groups over several years. Olympian Ian Thorpe says his time in the pool was marred by homophobia The swimming icon and five-time Olympic gold medallist Ian Thorpe didn’t come out as gay until after his stellar sporting career and says his time in the pool was marred by homophobia, AAP reports. Speaking at the Sydney WorldPride Human Rights Conference about homophobia in sport, he blamed the media for sensationalist speculation about his sexuality. “I was directly asked by a journalist at 16 if I was gay,” he said. “That headline was ready to print on the basis of my answer and this was leading into the Olympics – so at the time I only thought of being gay as a negative.” Reporters would not ask a minor such a question today, but Thorpe pointed to various football codes for entrenching casual and blatant homophobia, singling out Manly Sea Eagles rugby league players for not playing in a Pride Round last year. “The NRL has basically copped out and is looking at introducing a respect round,” he said on Wednesday. Thorpe questioned why athletes weren’t “willing to actually wear a few colours on their shirt that means so much to so many people”. He appealed to athletes to show empathy and “understand what it’s like for a young gay person to grow up and to face disadvantage and discrimination”. Charles Darwin University announces new Indian office Charles Darwin University (CDU) has announced the opening of a new office in India during a trip to the nation with the education minister, Jason Clare. A delegation of vice-chancellors are travelling with Clare on his visit this week in a sign of the higher education sector’s efforts to ramp up development prospects in the rapidly developing tertiary sector. The minister will officially open the office – to employ six staff in the business district of Gurgaon – on Thursday afternoon alongside senior government officials. CDU’s vice-chancellor, Scott Bowman, said the move aimed to attract students from South Asia to campuses in the Northern Territory and Sydney: Establishing an in-country presence in India is critical to Charles Darwin University and the Northern Territory in achieving our international student growth ambitions. It is a natural progression for Charles Darwin University towards helping attract students from one of the fastest-growing regions of the world, where quality higher education is valued. We are uniquely placed in our ability to offer exceptional graduate employment outcomes. At a Universities Australia gala dinner last week, Clare announced he would sign a sweeping mutual recognition agreement for qualifications between the two nations as Australia aims to capitalise on India’s ambitious goals in the education sector. It comes amid a drop in enrolments amongst Chinese students that has battered the university sector since the onset of the pandemic. Indigenous advocacy groups raise concerns on NSW policing Advocacy groups are raising concerns about how NSW police conduct policing duties and have responded to a new report by the state’s watchdog, the Law Enforcement Conduct Committee. The report examined policing across the state and looked at how that has impacted Indigenous communities with advocates arguing that “consorting laws” are being misused, with First Nations people being disproportionately targeted under the policies. The so-called consorting amendments were introduced in 2019 and made it a criminal offence for anyone to continue associating with at least two people who have been convicted of an indictable offence and were targeting serious organised crime such as bikie gangs. The report released on Tuesday found that the NSW police issued 16,480 warnings to 2,671 people and that most were in response to less serious offences or warnings rather than serious crime. The report found that nearly half of all those subjected to consorting laws identified as Aboriginal, with 42% of the 4,257 people warned or named in a formal warning being Indigenous. A further 46% of all people who received a police warning from general duties officers were Aboriginal and in some parts of the state Indigenous people were vastly over-represented with over 75% of people in Western NSW identifying as Indigenous. In total, 48 young people under the age of 18 were issued with a warning, and of those 12 were Aboriginal children or teenagers. Nadine Miles, Aboriginal Legal Service NSW/ACT’s principal legal officer, is quoted in the statement as saying the laws are “unfairly” targeting First Nations peoples: When parliament passed these laws, they handed police another tool to unfairly target Aboriginal communities. Far from targeting serious and organised crime, consorting laws have been used to criminalise social interactions and relationships between Aboriginal people. She is calling for the parliament to reform the laws while Gabrielle Bashir SC, the president of the NSW Bar Association, said the report revealed that serious organised crime and offenders weren’t the only ones being targeted under the regime: They are shocking figures. Equating warnings for consorting with diversion from the criminal justice system reflects a fundamental misunderstanding, which must be immediately rectified. Regional community divided on local hospital A community on the NSW-Victorian border remains divided over new hospital plans, as the local health service pleads for unity, AAP reports. In October the NSW and Victorian governments announced $558m to upgrade the Albury hospital, despite local lobbying for a brand new one to be built on a greenfield site. At Albury Wodonga Health’s annual general meeting on Tuesday, the chair, Matt Burke, stressed the key priority was that the future hospital be constructed on a single site, consolidating acute and subacute services. “Every doubt cast on the new hospital is another person who loses confidence to seek treatment in their time of need,” he said. “How long are you willing to wait for a new hospital that may never come while we have the funds to build a new one right now?” Albury-Wodonga Health (AWH) provides services to almost 300,000 people in the twin cities, and the region performs below the national average on multiple health outcomes, including mental health, heart disease and life expectancy. Queensland failed to protect some of its threatened species The Queensland government has failed to fully deliver on five of the seven recommendations from a five-year-old audit that demanded better protections for Queensland’s threatened species. Black-breasted button-quail, Julia Creek dunnart and wallum froglet are just three of the more than 900 plants and animals in the sunshine state that are threatened by extinction but do not have recovery plans in place. But despite being under “considerable and increasing pressure”, species are being failed by a lack of coordinated approach from Queensland’s environment department, the auditor general, Brendan Worrall, found in a report tabled recently in parliament. Worrall said the Queensland government’s biodiversity conservation strategy, released last October, “did not include measures or targets”. “The current lack of measures reduces its ability to monitor outcomes for biodiversity, and demonstrate whether the strategy is achieving the results expected from the resources provided,” the report found. “The department does not yet have a comprehensive framework to prioritise animals and plants based on risk”. Natalie Frost, a nature campaigner with the Queensland Conservation Council, said that in the absence of a comprehensive framework, threatened species were not being adequately monitored nor recovery measures implemented “We are in a climate and biodiversity crisis and it is appalling that species are not getting the protection they need here in Queensland.” DES doesn’t have a comprehensive framework to prioritise animals and plants based on risk, meaning more than 1000 threatened species in Queensland are not adequately monitored and recovery measures are not implemented.” The federal government has accused the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, of “incredibly irresponsible” comments in the lead-up to the Aukus announcement. As reported here on the blog earlier today, Dutton told reporters in Victoria that he still believed the US Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarine was the best option for Australia. When asked about rumours that the British SSN(R), which is still in development, may be the successful choice, Dutton said the advice to him when he was defence minister “was very clear, that Rolls-Royce didn’t have any production capability left, no headroom”. He said the Virginia class was “a proven design” and he believed they could start to operate this decade - even though US congressional figures have warned their production line is already stretched. Dutton added: I worry that if the government has taken a decision to go for a cheaper design that it will delay the delivery of those submarines. The minister for defence industry, Pat Conroy, has taken exception to these comments. Conroy told reporters: Well, I think those comments from Peter Dutton are incredibly irresponsible. This was a man who received classified briefings up until the 21 May on this program. He is either being mischievous or he’s not privy to the latest information. Conroy said Australia “would be in a much better position” if the former Coalition government “hadn’t chopped and changed so much” on the replacement for Australia’s existing fleet of Collins class diesel-electric submarines. He went through the history of the initial push for a deal with Japan, before it backtracked and began a process that led to the French bid being selected, before that was torn up in favour of Aukus: When we came into government, there was a serious risk of having a capability gap and now we are confident that we have a pathway to resolve that capability gap. That will be detailed when we make the announcement. But I just think it’s incredible for Peter Dutton to make these comments - they’re mischievous, they undermine confidence in the program and it’s like the arsonist burning down a house and they’re complaining about how long it takes for the fire brigade to get there. This man has caused this problem. He’s a man who’s driven 28 projects to be 97 years late. And I just find it completely unhelpful in the public debate for him to be injecting this stuff when he knows that there are security reasons that mean that we can’t detail information until we make the announcement. NT communities evacuated due to flooding Residents in four remote Northern Territory communities are currently being evacuated to Darwin because of flooding in the region. The chief minister has signed an emergency declaration and authorities say they are working hard to relocate around 700 people, the ABC is reporting. The Bureau of Meteorology is warning of major flooding in the upper Victoria River as a result of heavy rainfall. I will bring you more as it comes. Man dies in workplace accident Queensland police are preparing a report for the coroner after a man has died in a workplace incident in Beaudesert, central Queensland. Channel 7 news is reporting the man was crushed to death by a fibreglass pool at a factory. Police told the Guardian that emergency services were called just after 10am in relation to a workplace incident. The man was declared deceased at the scene and police are assisting Health and Safety Queensland with their investigations. Asic takes legal action over alleged mistreatment of whistleblower The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) has announced it is taking legal action for the first time over the alleged mistreatment of a corporate whistleblower. Asic announced Wednesday it was lodging a federal court case against coal producer TerraCom Limited and four executives over its handling of a whistleblower complaint about the alleged falsification of coal quality results. Asic deputy chair Sarah Court said: This is a significant case because it is the first time Asic has taken action for alleged breaches of the whistleblower provisions. Asic alleges that TerraCom and its senior company employees engaged in conduct that harmed a whistleblower who revealed the alleged falsification of coal quality certificates. Whistleblowers perform a vital role in identifying and calling out corporate misconduct We take any indication that companies are engaging in conduct that harms or deters whistleblowers very seriously. The case alleges that the company falsely told the ASX that the whistleblower’s allegations were wrong and that they had been independently investigated. By allowing the “false or misleading statements” to be published, the company is said to have “engaged in conduct that caused detriment to the whistleblower’s reputation, earning capacity, and psychological and emotional state”, Asic said. Terracom told the ASX on Wednesday that it would “vigorously defend the proceedings”. The proceedings relate to disclosures made by the company with respect to a former employee in early 2020. The company has lawyers engaged and will vigorously defend the proceedings. Thank you for your attention today. You’re now in the excellent hands of Cait Kelly! ABC staff have voted to take protected industrial action for the first time in 17 years over what they say is a poor pay offer from ABC management. Hundreds of staff met today around the country and agreed to walk off the job for 40 minutes at 2pm on Tuesday to coincide with the Reserve Bank board meeting and BA official cash rate announcement, on 7 March. Earlier they voted overwhelmingly in favour of taking industrial action, which will include different strategies up to and including a full 24-hour stoppage. Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance media director Cassie Derrick said 90% of staff were in favour of taking industrial action because the offer from management was not good enough. ABC managing director David Anderson has taken over the bargaining with unions but talks have stalled. Derrick said: This is not just about pay. It’s about ensuring a fair go at forging a career at the public broadcaster. The union says the offer must also include back pay to the expiry date of the previous enterprise bargaining agreement. Greek rail tragedy ‘felt intensely’ in Australia You may have already read about this terrible news out of Greece today, where at least 29 people have been killed and 85 injured after two trains collided near the town of Tempe. The shadow minister for foreign affairs, Simon Birmingham, says the tragedy is being “felt intensely in Australia” particularly because of the large community of Greek Australians. About 20 people are being urged to prepare to evacuate their homes with a large bushfire already threatening some properties in Queensland’s Western Downs region. Firefighters have urged people living at Weir River, southwest of Dalby, to prepare to leave as they battle the fast-moving blaze. They say the fire is burning on Cecil Plains Road and Cecil Plains Moonie Road near the Kumbarilla state forest towards North Boondilla Boundary Rd, Colemans Road and O’Connor Road. The Queensland Fire and Emergency Service said in an alert today: Conditions could get worse quickly. Firefighters are working to control the fire, however you should not expect a firefighter at your door. Firefighting aircraft may assist ground crews. People living at the nearby Waar Waar Homestead, and anyone in Waar Waar state forest and surrounding areas are urged to stay informed of the situation. - AAP SBS Audio takes flight SBS Radio has today become SBS Audio, reflecting the public broadcaster’s offering of programs in addition to podcasts and live streaming services. David Hua, SBS Director of Audio and Language Content: Every week we broadcast more than 262 hours of original audio content. The new SBS Audio digital experience across the app and website will further drive growth in a space where we are already seeing more than six million streams and podcast downloads every month. More than 5.6m Australians use a language other than English at home have access to language services on SBS Radio 1, SBS Radio 2 and SBS Radio 3 channels. SBS caters to 63 languages in total across radio, podcasting, online and social media, including new programming in Bislama, Malay, Oromo and Tetum. Privatised cleaning of NSW schools has failed staff and students, UWU says The privatisation of school cleaning in New South Wales schools is failing staff and students, according to a survey released by the United Workers Union (UWU). The survey of more than 400 NSW school cleaners found half didn’t have enough time to complete necessary cleaning and a quarter said they hadn’t been properly paid by private contractors. Almost 80% surveyed reported they worked split shifts, where their day could span 13 hours and the bulk of work completed before and after school. The UWU said the privatised system was leading to the reduction of full time jobs and an unreasonable workload, citing examples of work schedules providing one cleaner 10 minutes to clean a school’s 36 toilets. The union is calling on the state government to bring services back under its control when the five-year contract expires in December. Milena, a school cleaner said contracting “wasn’t working”. NSW opposition leader Chris Minns has promised Labor wouldn’t pursue further privatisations if elected. If cleaners in the ACT, Queensland and Western Australia can be employed directly by the government, why shouldn’t we? ... we need better. Linda Revill, UWU property services co-ordinator, said cleaners were being burdened with “unrealistic goals”: It’s not good enough the state is spending $1.75bn on this five-year contract but cleaners have in some cases seen their numbers more than halve at their schools. Schools aren’t being cleaned safely or properly and cleaners are barely scraping out a living on $22.76 an hour. NSW school cleaners are a living example of a failed privatisation that needs to be reversed, to the benefit of children, parents, teachers, schools and the workers. National security chiefs focus on TikTok risks The Australian government is looking to the nation’s top security agencies to determine if any actions should be taken against popular social media app TikTok. Treasurer Jim Chalmers says the government and security agencies are aware of the White House’s actions, with a new directive giving all US federal agencies 30 days to wipe the app off government devices. Questions have been raised about the Chinese-owned social media app’s surreptitious data collection methods. Chalmers said the government hasn’t yet been advised to take the same action as its US counterparts, but it would act on the recommendations of security agencies. He told ABC TV. We’ll take the advice of our national security agencies. But the advice to us hasn’t yet changed. Home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, last year ordered her department to investigate how TikTok harvests data following concerns China can access the personal information of Australians. O’Neil has asked national security agencies to provide a range of options to tackle data collection by social media giants. China has hit back at the US, saying it firmly opposed the action. Foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said: How unsure of itself can the world’s top superpower be to fear a young people’s favourite app like that? The US has been over-stretching the concept of national security and abusing state power to suppress foreign companies. The US government should respect the principles of market economy and fair competition ... and provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign companies. - AAP Family of released archaeologist ‘overjoyed’ The family of a Toowoomba-based archaeologist taken hostage in the remote highlands of Papua New Guinea say they are overjoyed by his safe return and are now focused on helping him heal. Prof Bryce Barker and his research team were captured by a criminal gang of about 20 “runners” moving guns and drugs across PNG while researching the history of human migration to Australia. The New Zealand-born professor was released on Sunday. The family said in a statement today: We are overjoyed to have Bryce back home with us. The kindness and care of so many in our community have been sources of strength for us. We kindly ask for privacy as we begin the healing process with Bryce. Thank you again to everyone who played a role in his safe return home. GDP growth stalled if population growth was taken out Australia boasted going about three decades without a recession. One reason for this was that population growth helped fan demand in the economy. Well, that story looks like continuing. While the economy did expand 0.5%, as noted earlier in the December quarter, it was flat on a per capita basis. New migrant numbers are now rebounding, along with overseas students, so there should be ongoing demand from those two groups. They could help Australia avoid a recession although it will be interesting to see if per-capita numbers reveal a retreat. Meanwhile, there’s also a spread of growth outcomes across the economy, with several states going backwards (including the one that’s holding state elections on 25 March, NSW). Not sure if we’ll have politicians heralding a “Canberra-led recovery” but for now at least, the ACT is leading the way. LGBTIQ+ health plan will ‘save lives’ LGBTIQ+ Health Australia says the federal government’s $26m pledge for health strategies “will save lives”, saying wellbeing outcomes for the queer community have worsened even as other indicators have improved. LHA CEO Nicky Bath said: A 10-year plan developed with input from an LGBTIQ+ Health Advisory group will give government a blueprint for change. It is a foundation for improved policies, interventions and approaches to achieve equitable health and wellbeing outcomes. As reported earlier, assistant health minister Ged Kearney and health minister Mark Butler will announce the new funding and a 10-year wellbeing plan today. There’s also $26 million for research specifically into LGBTIQ+ health outcomes. Bath said: This action plan will save lives. It is a crucial advance in addressing the serious inequities LGBTIQ+ people experience in health outcomes. Although LGBTIQ+ people have been identified as a priority population in many national strategies, for many years the disparities in health and wellbeing outcomes have persisted or worsened. She said LHA looked forward to working with the government on the plan. Speaking to a human rights conference connected to World Pride, Kearney today said “there is still so much work to be done, especially in improving health outcomes for LGBTIQA+ people”. I know, and we as a government know, these issues are complicated and there is much more to do. The government is opening consultation on the action plan today. Codes acknowledge link between head injuries and neurodegenerative disease Three of the major Australian football codes, NRL, Rugby Australia and Football Australia, have acknowledged the link between head trauma and serious neurodegenerative disease at a senate inquiry hearing today. Representatives from those contact sports organisations gave evidence today as part of the third day of public hearings for the senate inquiry into concussions and repeated head trauma in contact sports. Their appearances came in the wake of moving evidence from Hayley Shaw, the daughter of late NRL player and coach, Steve Folkes, who was the first Australian to be diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) posthumously in 2019. A large and growing body of scientific evidence shows links between contact sports and CTE. Shaw said her family had never been contacted by representatives of the NRL since they found out about her father’s pathology, despite its links to his playing career and the diagnosis being widely reported. We also heard from Boxing Australia this morning, and this afternoon we’ll hear from the Rugby Union Players Association and representatives from some government agencies responsible for research funding and health. Elsewhere, Collingwood coach and former player Nathan Buckley has come to the defence of the Australian Football League after news broke earlier this week that a Melbourne law firm was preparing a class action against the AFL, seeking compensation on behalf of players who had suffered concussion. Buckley told the Herald Sun he didn’t think the AFL should be held responsible for concussions players sustain: I’m interested by this strict liability and where it sits – I think a lot of people try to slate it across to the league itself. But I suggest that anyone who has ever played the game has played the game knowing the risks associated and assuming the risks associated to their health both immediate and potentially down the track.’ You do get well paid for it but you’ve been playing it since you were a kid so when does the AFL become responsible for your choice to play the game? When you’ve been doing it for possibly 10 years plus before you even enter that competition, I don’t know exactly how that is going to be determined. The AFL has yet to give evidence to the inquiry. Taylor is asked why he refused to support energy discounts for pensioners: We voted against the government’s price caps which won’t work and we have seen the result on the supply side of the gas industry and I’m confident we will see a lot more than that. But we want higher incomes for pensioners and that’s why we went to the budget in reply and laid out a pathway for pensioners to be able to do a few extra hours of work and not lose their pensions. This would solve two problems. It would get more workers available for businesses, that’s a great thing, we need, it’s the number one thing we hear from small businesses around Australia is that Australians need workers. Taylor has been asked about how the super policy would be modest in comparison to the tax cuts the Liberal government legislated for higher earners: Let’s be clear. They haven’t been upfront with the Australian people about how many Australians are going to be affected. The important point here is the Treasury included a very tricky provision in what has been laid out, which is to not index the threshold. This is tricky behaviour we are starting to see from Labor and what it means is that for someone who expects to go to the pension phase in turn, 20, 30, 40 years, that threshold in real terms will be way below what Labor has laid out. If inflation continues to rise, that threshold in real terms will fall dramatically and the number of Australians affected will rise dramatically. Taylor: They are putting legislation through in this term, so this idea that they are taking this to the Australian people is deeply misleading. They are legislating it now without taking it to the Australian people. That was my point this morning. Taylor: The government has promised that they are going to try to fight some kind of way to relieve some of these pressures, but the reality is we have seen no relief on these pressures at all. In fact, interest rates can either go up, the expectation is they will continue to go up. With an extra $114 billion of spending from the government in the last budget, stimulant in the economy and putting extra pressures on inflation, and interest rates. Despite Australians paying sharply more tax in the last quarter … the government wants to tax Australians more. Make no mistake about it. Labor’s 2019 big taxing agenda is back. It is back. Taylor says the government has broken an election promise not to touch super – despite the fact this legislation comes into effect after the next election. Taylor is talking about the accounts data out today: What we see in the data is the slowing economy and raging inflation in particular we have seen enormous pressures now on Australian households. They are pulling back on the savings rates in order to be able to make ends meet. We are seeing three pressures in particular that I want to highlight that’s come out of the data. First we know well, inflationary pressures, inflation running at almost 8%, but second-guessing very strong growth in the mortgage payments that Australians are having to pay as we see interest rates are rising, and these are put great pressures on many Australian households with a mortgage. The third clear pressure that comes through the data is on taxation. We have seen an increase in tax payments from Australian households of over 7% in the last quarter. We are going to go now to shadow treasurer Angus Taylor – who is speaking in Canberra. King also flagged future legislative changes to Infrastructure Australia in her speech: It was set up to be a rigorous, expert, independent body to provide advice to the commonwealth government about priority infrastructure investments. But over recent years, it has tried to do too many things and ended up being sidelined by a government that, frankly, wasn’t interested in its advice. Guided by the advice of Nicole Lockwood and Mike Mrdak, our changes will put in place a stronger, more focused Infrastructure Australia. I will soon be introducing legislation and then appointing three commissioners to lead the organisation into the future. She says the revitalised Infrastructure Australia will: produce a more refined, smaller, targeted Infrastructure Priority list; develop a national planning and assessment framework to support national consistency in infrastructure assessment, including the way benefit-cost ratios are calculated; be more active in the post-completion stage of infrastructure projects to learn and inform future projects; work to build capacity with local government and regional bodies to undertake more rigorous assessment of projects; work more closely with the infrastructure bodies set up by states and territories; participate as an integral part of the budget process in advising me and the expenditure review committee on requests from states and territories for investment. The man suspected of murdering Queensland woman Toyah Cordingley more than four years ago has landed in Australia after being extradited from India. Rajwinder Singh touched down in Melbourne with a Queensland police escort on a Qantas flight from Delhi about 12.40pm today. The 38-year-old will be taken to a magistrates’ court, where Queensland police will apply to extradite him north to be questioned over the alleged murder of Cordingley. The Australian citizen, who denies killing Cordingley, had previously worked as a nurse and lived in Innisfail with his wife and three children. In January he waived his right to extradition, saying outside a Delhi court: I did not kill the woman.” He added that he wanted to “reveal all the details” to an Australian court. - AAP King tasked Dr Kerry Schott to provide a review into the entire Inland Rail project. The government is yet to release the review, but in her speech King says “ it makes for gripping reading.” Now, Inland Rail is way over budget and way behind schedule. To get it back on track, Minister [Katy] Gallagher and I, together tasked Dr Kerry Schott to provide us with a review into the entire project. She had a big project on her hands. Katy and I are working with cabinet colleagues to finalise a response to Dr Schott’s review and will release a response together and we’ll have more to say on that in the future. I can tell you when you see the report, it makes for gripping reading, to those who want to learn the lessons about how not to do nation-building. Dr Schott found significant concerns about the governance and the delivery of the project. It is, frankly, a damning indictment on the National party and a salutary lesson as to why they should never have their hands on portfolios with large discretionary funds again. The infrastructure minister, Catherine King, is addressing the National Press Club in Canberra. After speaking about the challenges climate change poses for infrastructure, King calls out the opposition’s infrastructure decisions: The simple fact is that the past decade, where the Liberal and National party treated the infrastructure investment pipeline as their own election fund, has been one of significant lost opportunity. They chose to spend money on commuter carparks, urban congestion projects and Roads of Strategic Importance that miraculously seemed largely only to be needed in Liberal and National party seats. That’s why I am so determined that commonwealth investment is targeted, that we invest in projects that deliver productivity growth, connect communities, future proof our routes and deliver social and economic returns. Ensuring we get the benefit underpins the decision that I, as a minister, and we, as a government, have made so far. A prime example of the previous government’s failures and the serious impact of this is inland rail. I want to remind people the reason that inland rail was invested in in the first place: to increase our nation’s productivity, to take freight off already congested roads and to move them efficiently and safely and to get goods to market more quickly. The previous government, I think, lost sight of this. They didn’t see it as a project that had those goals and under my predecessor [Barnaby Joyce], frankly, I think the project became something of a strange vanity project for him. The inland rail is a project which was the subject of a major Guardian investigation last year by our rural editor Gabrielle Chan, Andy Ball, Mike Bowers and myself. Our interactive feature enables you to travel along the route from Melbourne and Brisbane to see what the people affected by the project – which has blown out over $14bn – have to say: Queensland police hail better recording of domestic violence The Queensland police service responded to more than 138,000 cases of domestic and family violence in the last financial year – an increase of 15% on the previous reporting period. But QPS domestic, family violence and vulnerable persons command inspector Melissa Dwyer says she is “really buoyed” by the figures, which she attributed, largely, to better reporting of violence against partners and family members. She said: The way in which Queensland police service is recording the prevalence of domestic and family violence has been improved. So we have a better and truer appreciation of what is happening in Queensland homes. Dwyer said the scourge of domestic and family violence was “inextricably linked” to youth crime, now dominating headlines and government policy in Queensland: When we look at those statistics 138,871 DFV occurrences, it is really sobering to remember that there is a victim-survivor in every single one of those circumstances. And a perpetrator. And, invariably, there are children. WA’s ‘Free the Nippers’ campaign takes aim at Woodside sponsorship Parents whose children take part in Nippers in Western Australia have launched a campaign demanding Surf Lifesaving Australia WA drop its sponsorship arrangement with gas company Woodside. More than 400 people have signed a letter for the “Free the Nippers” campaign calling for Woodside’s logo to be removed from the Nippers uniform. Parents have been speaking out about the deal, which began in 2019 and gave Woodside naming rights to the Nippers program for 10 years. Sustain Surf chair and Nippers parent James Anderson said using junior surf lifesaving members to advertise a fossil fuel company was unethical: We wouldn’t let a cigarette company stick its logo on our kids, and we shouldn’t let Woodside get away with using Nippers to advertise its fossil fuel business. He said surf life savers and surf clubs were on the climate frontline: The majority of Australian surf clubs are built on unstable locations put at risk by rising sea levels as our beaches are being eroded. Woodside’s expanding gas extraction will fuel long-term damage to our iconic surf life saving movement, not to mention our members’ health. The treasurer’s press conference has wrapped up but, don’t worry, there will be plenty more news out of Canberra. The infrastructure minister, Catherine King, has just stepped up to address the National Press Club. We’ll bring you what she has to say but first a few updates from my colleagues outside the capital. Chalmers quizzed on refusal to index super cap Phil Coorey, the political editor of the AFR, asked Jim Chalmers about his refusal to index the cap: We had modelling down by one of the industry groups. And they say someone today who is 45 years old and plans to retire at 65, in 20 years’ time ... Chalmers: I’m fine because I’m 45 tomorrow, not today. (Chalmers has the same birthday as Anthony Albanese, who is 60 tomorrow.) Coorey: Someone who gets only 10% contribution not 15% will have an effective cap in retirement of $1.6m which is less than the tax transfer cap today of $1.7m. Someone who is 25 years old today will have - in today’s dollars, will have a tax transfer cap of less than $1m. So younger workers, today, people younger than me, are going to be the worse off than me when they get to retirement. Is that fair? Chalmers: I think one of the reasons for that is because there’s a gender gap in super as well. We have said, I think, publicly, probably countless times now, that we think there is work to do when it comes to adequacy, particularly for Australian women … My goal here, my objective here, I’ve been really clear about, is to try and make superannuation more sustainable. Superannuation in Australia is world class. Absolutely world class. But it’s got its imperfections. The gender gap is a big imperfection. The affordability of tax concession for people with $100m in super is a big imperfection. Super changes will raise $3.2bn over five years, treasurer says Circling back to the treasurer’s press conference, our very own Paul Karp asks: The Coalition’s criticised you for not indexing the $3m threshold for the super changes. Just going back to the question of modelling, is there anything you can give us today, like a 10-year figure, how much the change is going to raise, or any assurance about what proportion of people are going to be affected in the future? Jim Chalmers: Well, in terms of the costings, it will raise $900m in the forwards, $3.2bn over five years. I have included that extra year I want you to understand it’s about $2bn or just over when it’s properly up and running. When we want to, and when we’re ready to provide any further numbers we’ll do that. On the $3m threshold, I think this is an important design feature. Obviously we’re consulting on the design features. But one of the reasons why I think it is important that the threshold is at $3m is because we want to make superannuation more sustainable over time. And, I think, if you strip away all of the politics and all of the argy-bargy of this building away from it. I don’t think any objective observer could look at our superannuation system and think anything other than we need to make these tax concessions for people with millions of dollars in super more sustainable, fairer, when have $1tn in debt and the budget intensifying. Karp: For the rest of the medium term, will it raise more than $2bn? Chalmers: It will raise in the fist year $2.3bn. As more people down the track save more than $3m in retirement, then they’ll become subject to still generous tax concessions but slightly less so. US Virginia-class submarines a proven design, Dutton says Returning to some defence news out of the earlier press conference given by the opposition leader, Peter Dutton: He told reporters in Avalon (with periodic interruptions from noisy aircraft taking part in the air show) that he still believed US Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines would be the best choice for Australia. Even though these submarines have much larger numbers of crew required, Dutton insisted that Australia could find the crew required, “and we could joint-crew it” with the US. And that’s going to be the reality on any platform. The Australian, UK and US governments are expected to announce the details of their plans this month. Dutton was asked about rumours that the British SSN(R), which is still in development, may be the choice, and whether he thought that would be a mistake. He was also asked about whether Australia should be prepared to pay to boost the already overstretched US production line. For months Dutton has made no secret of his preference for Virginia-class submarines. He said he had “the greatest of respect for the Brits, who, frankly, facilitated us coming into discussions with the Americans”. (The Morrison government entered into talks with the UK before they jointly approached the US, according to the official history of Aukus.) But Dutton said the Americans “bent over backwards to do whatever they could in the context of the Aukus negotiations, so it’s clear to me that if there is a will from the Albanese government that many options are available to them”. Dutton, the former defence minister, said the advice to him at the time “was very clear, that Rolls-Royce didn’t have any production capability left, no headroom”. He added: The beauty in my mind with the American model, of the Virginia class, was that it was a proven design, it gave us interoperability with the Americans and there will be more American subs in the Indo-Pacific than there will be British submarines, who will concentrate, quite rightly – particularly given the Russian threat – to continental Europe ... I worry that if the government has taken a decision to go for a cheaper design that it will delay the delivery of those submarines. And with the Virginia class, I thought that we could bring them on this decade and I’ve made that point on a number of occasions. I absolutely still believe it’s a better case. Exports and spending shored up otherwise weak GDP growth Australia’s 0.5% increase in GDP for the December quarter was shy of economists forecasts, as noted above, but also the slowest pace since the September 2021 quarter (marred by lockdowns in half the economy, if you can recall). Growth has also slowed for three quarters in a row. Without consumption rising 0.4% and exports rising 1.1%, the number might have looked a bit worse as both private and government investment shrank. Among the deluge of data, one number to jump out was a drop in the household saving ratio, which sank from a revised 7.1% in the September quarter to 4.5% in the final three months of 2022. That tally is now at its lowest level since the September quarter of 2017, or back in those pre-pandemic days when we weren’t stashing money in the sock draw. Anyway, the slumping savings rate suggests households are funding part of their spending from savings and that trend has its limits. Not that households are necessarily in dire straits. Household income payable (which sounds a bit jargony) rose 8.9%, or the most since June 2002. The ABS said: Income tax rose, aligned with continued growth in wages, employment and hours worked, plus higher returns on investment income. the ABS said. Interest on deposits, for instance, rose 25.3%. The flipside of higher interest rates, though, is that those who have loans to repay are forking out a lot more. Interest payable on dwellings rose 23%, reflecting further interest rate rises over the quarter. GDP is a slightly backward-looking set of figures since we are two-thirds into the current quarter. One thing we can assume with some confidence, though, is that those interest payable numbers are going higher, for at least a while longer even if the economy is losing some steam. Taking questions, the treasurer is asked about the divide which came out as both he and the PM took the breakfast news programs speaking about yesterday’s announcement on changes to superannuation and the possibility of other changes to tax concessions. While Jim Chalmers told Sunrise he wouldn’t rule out changes to the capital gains tax exemption on the family home, Anthony Albanese told ABC Radio the government would not impact the family home “full stop, exclamation mark”. Given his “opportunity to do the same” by a reporter, Chalmers responds with a mea culpa: I do do that, and I should have done that this morning too. What I’m trying to maintain a focus on what we are doing, not what we’re not doing. I am concerned that having provided in the interests of transparency a sense of all of the tax breaks across the budget, and Treasury’s best assessment of how they’re growing, I don’t want to get into the practice of coming before you each day and working through hundreds of billions of dollars of tax concessions and playing the same rule-in, rule-out game. I should have done that when it came to the family home this morning. And I’m happy to say that. I’m very prepared to say that and I’m happy to tell you why. I want the country focused on this choice that we can make to make superannuation more affordable by making the tax concessions in super more sustainable and in the process, make the budget more responsible. That’s my objective. I want to focus on that. The tax expenditure statement released yesterday is not a statement of intent. It’s not a policy statement. It’s a summary of facts. And I want people to see it that way. But we’ve no intention of going after capital gains tax on the family home. ‘2023 will be a story of some substantial economic challenges’ Jim Chalmers ends his initial speech by looking forward: Now, this was the story of 2022 in the national accounts figures before you this morning. Today the national accounts figures released this morning show the story of 2022. The unfolding story of 2023 will be a story of some substantial economic challenges, we can’t pretend them away. Interest rates are biting. Higher inflation has been biting in our economy and we’re not immune from global conditions either. I’m confident that we can get through this. I’m confident the worst of inflation is behind us rather than ahead of us. But we don’t pretend away the substantial challenges in our economy repute in today’s national accounts. ‘Our economy grew faster than all of the G7’ Despite sustained and growing challenges in the economy, Jim Chalmers elaborates on how the Australians economy is performing “substantially better” than comparable countries. He says he’s still confident Australia has “precisely the right economic plan for these conditions”: Our economy grew faster than all of the G7, at 2.7%, and more than double the OECD average of growth of 1.1%. And so, we are even with all of our challenges, outperforming the world when it comes to economic growth. Now we’ve been upfront about the challenges facing our economy from high inflation and rising interest rates and the global economic slowdown. But we are confident and optimistic but the future of our economy, but do have precisely the right economic plan for these conditions. Our economic plan is custom made for the conditions that we confront in our own economy and in the global economy. The best combination of cost-of-living relief, repairing our supply chains and showing restraint in the budget. We’re focused on addressing inflation with that cost-of-living relief, with our efforts to fix broken supply chains and by trying to make the budget more responsible, we can make the economy more resilient at the same time. Chalmers lists positives in Australian economy Jim Chalmers goes on to say the Australia has “a number of important things going for us in the economy more broadly”: The unemployment rate is still near historic lows, still has a three in front of it – that’s important. We have seen indications more broadly of the beginnings of decent wages growth in our economy, even though the hourly measure in these national accounts is a bit more modest. We are really pleased to see our tourism and education exports are continuing to bounce back from the pandemic. Returning international students and tourists supporting a 9.8% lift in service exports in the quarter. And that’s really important as a driver of growth in our economy. And we’re getting really good price for our commodity exports as well. ‘Inflation is likely to have peaked’ Zeroing in on inflation, which “remains the No 1 challenge for the economy”, Jim Chalmers says: While inflation is higher than we’d like, we’re cautiously hopeful that it has peaked and this is also the review of the Reserve Bank. The national accounts measure of consumer prices rose by 1.5% in the December quarter and 6.9% over the year. We also got the monthly inflation read for January today as well, there’s a lot of volatility in the monthly inflation read, we need to be cautious and careful about interpreting the monthly outcome. What it shows is that inflation in January is around 7.4% compared to 8.4% in the monthly read for December of last year. So this is more evidence that inflation is likely to have peaked in our economy and the worst when it comes to inflation is behind us. Obviously, inflation will be higher than we’d like for longer than we’d like, and this is an encouraging sign in this monthly inflation number is likely to peak at the end of last year. ‘Inflation is still the defining challenge in our economy’ Jim Chalmers goes on to say the cost-of-living pressures and rising interest rates remain the “major story” out of these figures: The major story of these national accounts being released today is really about the cost-of-living pressures and the impact of rising interest rates on Australian households in particular. Inflation is still the defining challenge in our economy and it’s still the primary focus of the Albanese’s economic plan. There’s lots of evidence of the impact of rising interest rates on Australians around the country in these new numbers today. Consumption growth softened to 0.3% in the quarter, to be 5.4% higher over the year. Households have continued to pull back on discretionary goods spending in favour of services as Australians look to get out and travel more around the country. With the sustained pressure on family budgets, we are seeing households saving less out of their income, the saving ratio has been declined sharply to 4.5%. More of people’s income is being directed to servicing their mortgages, international payments are up 23% in the December quarter. There’s some good indications in here that more homes are being built, as some of the supply constraints in the economy ease. And with a solid pipeline of work over the months ahead, there’s reasons to be relatively positive about the outlook for construction of homes. The treasurer is now speaking, saying the GDP figures that have just come in “tell the story of 2022” but that this coming year is “even more unpredictable”. Jim Chalmers: Today’s national accounts show that growth in the Australian economy is moderating as expected. This is the inevitable consequence of global challenges, high inflation, and rising interest rates. These numbers tell the story of 2022 and we know that 2023 will be a different story. The global economy is even more unpredictable. In war in Ukraine is entrenched and interest rates are biting harder and harder on our people. We knew that growth would begin to moderate around now and it is. We knew that 2023 would be a challenging year for the economy, and we still expect that to be the case. But despite all of these challenges, the Australian economy still grew by 0.5% in the December quarter of last year, and by 2.7% through 2022. This is faster growth than all of the major advanced economies and it’s more than twice the growth of the OECD average. I think it’s an unfortunate sign of the times. That even in one of – one of the best economies in the world here in Australia, our people are still under extreme pressure. It’s a sign of the times that even in one of the world’s best economies, people are still struggling under the weight of a global downturn, high inflation and rising interest rates as well. We’re expecting the treasurer Jim Chalmers to step up to speak in Canberra in just a moment – stay tuned. 7.4% CPI for January second-highest tally on record While the 7.4% CPI for January fell shy of expectations, the ABS notes that it is still the second-highest tally for any month since it began tracking monthly changes in September 2018. The monthly series is also not as complete as the quarterly numbers. Still, as the year rolls on, we’ll start to compare prices with sharply higher levels of a year ago after Russia invaded Ukraine and sent energy and food prices skyward. Covid supply snags are also easing. The Australian dollar had lost close to a quarter of a US cent in wake of the CPI and GDP numbers which is as clear a sign as any that expectations have budged on today’s numbers towards a reduced need for the RBA to hike its cash rate. Stocks also pared their losses for the day. As for contributors to the January CPI numbers, recreation and culture, and housing led the way, with increases of about 10% from a year earlier. Food and non-alcoholic beverages rose 8.2%. Fruit and vegetables actually fell in prices, becoming 2.3% cheaper. Also cheaper, apparently, were airfares and holiday accommodation, which were down 7.2% in January. That, though, compared with a 29.3% gain in December for this category, so some vacationers will still feel stung. More on GDP soon. ABC strike a step closer ABC journalists have voted overwhelmingly in favour of taking industrial action which will include a full 24-hour stoppage in a protected action ballot, and will meet later today to discuss the vote. Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance media director Cassie Derrick said 90% of staff were in favour of taking industrial action because the offer from management was not good enough. ABC managing director David Anderson has taken over the bargaining with unions but talks have stalled. Derrick said: This is not just about pay. It’s about ensuring a fair go at forging a career at the public broadcaster. The union says the offer must also include back pay to the expiry date of the previous enterprise bargaining agreement. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has responded to my colleague Katharine Murphy’s story that Liberal MP Bridget Archer could face a preselection push. Despite Archer’s streak of independence on a number of policies, Dutton backed her in. He told reporters in Avalon: Well, I haven’t seen those reports. Bridget Archer is an important part of our team. She works hard and she represents her community. So I want us to continue to work. There is a divergence of views in a number of issues. In the Labor party if you cross the floor, you have to resign from the party. In our party room, there’s a greater capability. I hope we can pre-select a candidate soon for the seat of Braddon and, as we know with Gavin Pearce, he’s been an incredible local member there. I think there’s opportunity for us in Tasmania and I hope that Bridget can continue to work with her colleagues in Canberra. Inflation and GDP growth numbers point to economy losing steam Numbers just out from the ABS will reinforce the view that the Reserve Bank may not have to nudge interest rates up much higher. Consumer price index numbers for January alone came in at 7.4%, well shy of the 8.1% expected by economists. Given that December’s CPI was 8.4%, pundits are likely to be saying inflation has peaked. (For the December quarter as a whole, CPI was 7.8%.) The economy, meanwhile, expanded 0.5% for the December quarter, shy of the 0.8% economists had been expecting. Those two relatively weak readings should see investors pare their bets about how much higher the RBA will have to go to take excessive demand out of the economy. Here’s how they viewed things before today’s numbers: January’s consumer prices rose 7.4% year on year, new figures show. This points to a slowdown in recent price rises. Meanwhile, Australia’s December quarter GDP expanded 0.5%, which is slower than expected. ‘We will repeal’ super tax changes if elected, Dutton says Dutton says that if elected back to government, the opposition would repeal the Albanese government’s proposed changes to superannuation: We’re dead against it. And we will repeal it. We’re not going to stand by and watch Australians attacked. There are 88,000 that they’re talking about now, but that figure of $3 million is not indexed, so in 10 or 15 years’ time, there will be tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Australians who will be affected by this. The message that it sends … to a lot of other Australians who are next in line when the Labor party needs more and more money, those people know that they’re next on the hitlist and I think the uncertainty that they’re creating around superannuation is completely unacceptable. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is speaking in Avalon in Victoria saying he finds the government’s changes to superannuation “unbelievable” and calling the tax expenditure statement released yesterday “a hitlist”. Dutton is saying that out of the $150bn in tax concessions the statement revealed, he thinks it’s an “absurdity” to think Labor won’t want to see more government savings from those tax breaks. The treasurer has a different stance, it seems, on some of these issues than the prime minister. I don’t know what’s happened with the rushed decision that they’ve made in the last 24 hours, but it seems that there is an internal war going on within the Labor party at the moment when it comes to taxing Australians. Now, the treasurer can describe it as a tweaking or a minor change or a minuscule change – all of that language, frankly, doesn’t mean anything to Australians who know that they have worked hard for their money. They have put their money into their tax – into their superannuation fund and for the government now to start changing the rules, it really unsettles a lot of Australians, particularly those who are heading towards retirement. So when Labor says that there won’t be any changes before an election – how on earth could you believe them? How could you believe anything the prime minister says? How could you believe anything the treasurer says, and when they’ve put out this hitlist, most Australians are going to be affected on that hitlist one way or the other. So if they think that out of $150bn that they’re going to be satisfied with $2bn, that is an absurdity. So I would be very worried, as you go down through that list, the impact that that would have on the economy. Tasmania RSL criticise AFL stadium location RSL Tasmania president, John Hardy, has written to the state’s premier, Jeremy Rockliff, urging him to reconsider the proposed location of a future AFL stadium in Hobart. The federal government is considering whether to partially fund the $715m stadium, which the state government wants to build at Macquarie Point near the CBD. The stadium is also very close to the Cenotaph. AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan has described the proposed stadium as critical to the success of a long-awaited Tasmanian AFL team. He has announced a $360m, 10-year funding commitment from the league to a Tasmanian team. In a letter to Rockliff, Hardy said he supported the construction of stadium but wanted it to be in a new location: We believe that the Tasmanians that erected this obelisk as an outpouring of unmeasurable grief after their loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice, would stand beside us shoulder to shoulder. The AFL has always supported Veterans, it is a working persons game and I believe the AFL will understand our issue. The veterans of this island know that we must prosper and that far too often Tasmanian representation is neglected on a national stage. But more than most, we also understand that some things are worth fighting for, and we must be forever vigilant. Prison officers at private jail walk off the job in NSW Prison officers at Parklea jail in Sydney’s west are striking for three days as they continue a campaign for more pay and better safety at work, AAP reports. It’s the third time the officers, who will rally outside the Parklea correctional centre at midday on Wednesday, have walked off the job in as many months. Community and Public Sector Union NSW assistant general secretary Troy Wright says the jail near Blacktown has the worst record for serious assaults on prison officers in NSW and the second worst rate of assaults among inmates. Officers at the maximum security men’s prison were the worst paid in the country, he said. The jail is privately run by US multinational MTC. Wright said: Imagine being so desperate for change in your workplace you would forgo three days’ pay in the hope someone would listen. In the past few years, there has been a riot and two fires at the jail, one of which caused $8m in damage. In the past year, there have been three deaths at Parklea prison. Wright said: In the last few weeks, a prison officer was king hit from behind and we know of officers having shivs held to their throats and being punched in the face. Understaffing is chronic and causing a lot of these problems, we know this prison is short-staffed each and every day. Some areas of the jail are meant to have 28 officers looking after 480 prisoners but routinely have just 17, Wright said. The union wants an increase in staffing levels and less weekend work. Comment is being sought from the prison. Cool start to autumn for south east Australia: BoM It’s the first day of autumn, leaving us all wondering – as Noel Harrison sung in The Windmills of Your Mind – “why did summer go so quickly?” The south-east of the country is already feeling the effects of the cooler autumn weather today but a return to milder conditions is expected over the weekend. Students ‘protesting against a tax on the right to protest’ in Sydney Student activists are holding a rally outside the Downing Centre in Sydney in opposition to the arrest of Cherish Kuehlmann, a student protester charged with a single count of unlawful entry at a recent demonstration. Kuehlmann was arrested at her home at midnight after she took part in a student protest outside the Reserve Bank of Australia over the housing crisis. Activists with the National Union of Students are calling on the police to drop the charges. Maddie Clark, the University of Sydney environment officer, who is facing suspension for a protest against former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull at the university last year, appeared at the protest. She urged the state government to reverse laws passed in the wake of a series of climate protests that introduced tough new penalties for activists who blocked roads, bridges and tunnels. She told the crowd: We are protesting against a tax on the right to protest. Kuehlmann said she was shocked to be arrested later that night as she had participated in many similar actions to the one at Martin Place without incident. What kind of society do we live in where 30 students can’t hold up placards outside the RBA without being threatened with a year in jail? Corporations are reporting record profits and landlords are jacking up rent. Meanwhile students are threatened with evictions and homelessness. I will not be intimidated and am determined to keep up the fight against the people responsible for this. A police fact sheet seen by Guardian Australia alleged the group had not completed one of the “form one” notifications to police to authorise a public assembly, and that during the protest demonstrators entered the Commonwealth bank where they began “shouting and protesting” while “using loudspeakers to spread their messages” for about five minutes. A Lismore climate campaigner on why she does what she does Ella Buckland became a campaign manager for Australian Parents for Climate Action in Lismore after the climate crisis came to her front door a year ago. In an opinion piece today, Buckland shares her experience of what this last year has been like for her and her community, as well as what she wants to see for the country going forward: I’ve never raised my child to be fearful of climate change. She doesn’t even know what it means. I did this to give her a few more years of innocence, but even with my careful planning for her mental health, climate change came to us. It broke down our doors and windows and delivered a rain of shit on to everything we loved. I don’t want this to be her future, or the future for any child. There are solutions, Australia is just not utilising them. We need to work together, we need to at least try to reduce emissions to keep our communities, our children safe, because next time, it could be your child. Read the entire piece here: Truth-telling inquiry to hear ‘human toll’ of injustice The personal toll of systemic injustices on Indigenous Victorians and their families is set to be laid bare by Australia’s first truth-telling inquiry, AAP reports. From today, Victoria’s Yoorrook Justice Commission will return for another two-week block of public hearings delving into the state’s “broken” child protection and criminal justice systems. The topics were raised by the commission last year, but the latest block of hearings will place a greater emphasise on personal experiences. Indigenous parents and carers of removed children and Stolen Generations members will be called during the first week. Commissioners will also hear from Aboriginal Victorians with links to the adult and youth criminal justice systems and their families, as well as advocates and experts. Some witnesses will speak in closed sessions because of the sensitive nature of their evidence. Yoorrook chair Eleanor Bourke said: We will hear about the human toll of systemic injustice, and the enduring impact this has on individuals, their families and community more broadly. Reforms to Victoria’s strict bail laws and raising the age of criminal responsibility will continue to be canvassed, after the state government committed to legislative changes, along with addressing systemic injustices in both systems. Reform needed in a number of areas, not just super tax: Allegra Spender Independent MP for Wentworth, Allegra Spender, says she wants to see a wider debate about the whole of Australia’s tax system, “not just one tax at a time”. In a Twitter thread this morning, Spender talks about the reform she’d like to see: We talked about capping super for a week. And now the government has acted. But the $2bn [p.a.] raised won’t solve our structural deficit. I’m really pleased the Treasurer Jim Chalmers is encouraging “conversations” because frankly there’s a lot we need to talk about. So let’s talk about our whole tax system. Not just one tax at a time. Australia relies too much on direct taxes - income tax and company tax. We’re out of step with other OECD countries. We need to consider other tax options. For example – what about a Minerals Resource Rent Tax for future mining? We’ve seen oil and gas companies reap super profits off the back of the Ukraine war. Australian taxpayers missed out. What sort of tax system should we have for the next mining boom? Cobalt, lithium etc … While we’re on Super – should we be pushing ahead with lifting compulsory Super to 12% in 2025? The Grattan Institute reports that younger Australians face financial stress because they’re putting aside more than they need for retirement. Let’s tackle that discussion too. And what about how govt spends your taxes? For example, we’re spending more on education than ever, but education standards aren’t rising. How can we spend that money to better effect? Problems aren’t always solved by more money. We’ve got to make sure we’re spending wisely. All these areas and more need reform – positive change for the future. Too often the major parties (pushed by the media) won’t tackle reform. They’re trapped in a spiral of gotchas and point scoring where reforms are ruled out before they’re even considered. We need to develop policies to achieve our national objectives for a future economy that supports innovation, business, climate action, and fairness. Voters want to see politics done better, and I’ll be consulting my constituents and pushing both sides to do politics better. On what reform other crossbenchers want to see, read Paul Karp’s latest: Home price slide loses momentum as new listings tighten The residential property market continues its downturn but the rate of decline has pulled back sharply, AAP reports. The monthly home value index released by property data from CoreLogic declined 0.14% over the month – the smallest monthly loss since the Reserve Bank first started hiking interest rates in May last year. CoreLogic’s research director Tim Lawless said consistently low numbers of new homes listed for sale and rising auction clearance rates were insulating home prices. Lawless said: The past four weeks have seen the flow of new capital city listings tracking 17% lower than a year ago and 11.9% below the previous five-year average. Across the capital cities, Sydney home values recorded the only uplift, rising 0.3%. But the easing rate of decline was evident across the board, with Darwin the only capital city to record a steeper monthly fall over the month. Regional home values fell 0.3% and faster than the 0.1% decline across combined capitals, although the lift in Sydney home values largely accounted for this difference. Overall, rest-of-state regions were still performing the same or better than their capital cities. Lawless said it was hard to say if the market was bottoming out or if this was “the eye of the storm”: Considering the Reserve Bank of Australia’s move to a more hawkish stance at the February board meeting, along with an expectation for a weaker economic performance and a loosening in labour markets, there is a good chance this reprieve in the housing downturn could be short-lived. Australia must set targets for amount of CO2 to be removed from air, scientists say Australia should set targets for the amount of carbon dioxide that could be pulled permanently from the atmosphere using “carbon drawdown” techniques like tree planting and direct air capture, according to a report from the Australian Academy of Science. A national coordinated approach is urgently needed to promote projects that remove carbon dioxide from the air, the report says, with a lack of policies seeing Australia fall behind other countries. Drivers asked to go without a car in Uber experiment Fifty Australian drivers will be challenged to give up their cars for a month and replace driving with ride-share trips, rental cars, e-bikes and scooter rides as part of a social experiment. Uber unveiled its One Less Car trial today, revealing it would work with behavioural researchers as well as micro-mobility firms Lug + Carrie and Lime to test whether it was possible and cheaper to replace car ownership with services. Each participant will receive more than $1300 in travel credits to use on public transport, Uber rides, short-term Uber car share rentals, e-bikes or e-scooters through Lime, and cargo e-bikes from Lug + Carrie. The trial will come after a survey of more than 1,000 Australians found almost half were concerned about road congestion but almost as many planned to buy another car within two years. Uber Australia general manager Dom Taylor said the experiment was “many, many years in the making” and was designed to challenge the idea Australians needed to own a car for everyday transport. There is going to be a gradual shift, we think, away from car ownership over the next 50 years but Uber’s the sort of place where we don’t love gradual shifts – we like step changes. There is a mind-boggling problem that Australia faces and that is the 15m cars that Aussies own that sit idle 95% of the time that are causing holes in our cities and our wallets. Uber will recruit participants from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra for the trial, and ask them to give up at least one of the cars in their household. Each person must fill out a journal about their experience and wear a fitness tracker to determine whether they exercise more. Taylor said data compiled in the trial would be analysed by researchers at The Behavioural Architects, and shared with academics and government agencies. - AAP Ancient texts shed new light on mysterious whale behaviour Taking a step away from superannuation for a moment to bring you news that will delight lovers of whales and ancient history alike. If there’s one story you’ll want to be bringing to your office lunchroom or whatever conversations you’re having today, it’s this one from our science writer Donna Lu about how ancient texts are shedding new light on mysterious whale behaviour: Mysterious whale feeding behaviour only documented by scientists in the 2010s has been described in ancient texts about sea creatures as early as two millennia ago, new research suggests. In 2011, Bryde’s whales in the Gulf of Thailand were first observed at the surface of the water with their jaws open at right angles, waiting for fish to swim into their mouths. Scientists termed the unusual technique, then unknown to modern science, as “tread-water feeding”. … Flinders University scholars now believe they have identified multiple descriptions of the behaviour in ancient texts, the earliest appearing in the Physiologus – the Naturalist – a Greek manuscript compiled in Alexandria around 150-200CE. Dr John McCarthy, a maritime archaeologist at Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia, and the study’s lead author, made the discovery while reading Norse mythology, about a year after he had seen a video of a whale tread-water feeding. Taylor doesn’t answer whether the coalition government would repeal the necessary legislation on these changes to super were they to win government at the next election, he only says that they will oppose the legislation in this term of parliament. He also questions the veracity of the government’s claim that the changes will only affect 80,000 Australians: It’s very important to understand the idea that this will only affect 80,000 Australians is baloney, because inflation is running hot and the threshold is not indexed. So we’ll see the threshold dropping in real terms and affecting many, many more Australians. At a time when we have high inflation, the Treasurer wants to impact many more Australians … the government should be honest about how many Australians will be affected in a relatively high environment as this threshold falls in real terms, and people’s superannuation accounts increase. Circling back to the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor’s interview with ABC News Breakfast. Taylor is worried about the other $150bn worth of tax concessions that were outlined in yesterday’s expenditure statement being “up for grabs” including a tax on the family home and taxes on negative gearing. When Rowland informs Taylor the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has just ruled out any changes to the capital gains tax on the family home, he says: Well, he ruled out taxing superannuation as well. So, it’s very clear from what’s been happening in the last week that Labor doesn’t keep its commitments. It doesn’t keep its promises. And I don’t think we can trust the prime minister on claiming he’s not wanting to tax the family home as well. Taylor is asked to confront the possibility he has double standards when it comes to criticising a Labor government, because as Rowlands points out the coalition government, under then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, “brought in a heap of changes in the 2016 budget” A $1.6m cap in tax concessions on pension phases, winding back contribution limits, increasing from $300,000 a year to $250,000 a year the income level in which high super taxes come in. None of that was fore shadowed to Australian voters. Taylor replies: They were taken to the 2016 election and legislated after the election. Labor is not proposing to do that. They’re proposing to legislate this now, in this term of Parliament. If they were serious about taking it to an election, they wouldn’t legislate before the election. It’s bizarre. It’s saying, yes, we’re going to legislate this now, and then we’ll take it to the Australian people. I mean that’s not taking it to the Australian people. LGBTQ+ health research funding ‘will save lives’: Equality Australia CEO Equality Australia has praised the government’s $26m for LGBTIQA+ health research as a “gamechanger” that “will save lives”. As reported earlier, the assistant health minister, Ged Kearney, will announce the funding later today in Sydney, as well as the development of a 10-year health and wellbeing strategy. She will detail the changes at a human rights conference connected to WorldPride. Equality Australia’s CEO, Anna Brown, backed the announcement this morning. This historic gamechanging commitment from the federal government recognises that our communities have unique and sometimes very challenging health needs. Quite simply, this plan will save lives. LGBTIQA+ people have significantly poorer mental health, disparities in other health outcomes and can often struggle to get the right care and treatment. Brown said LGBTIQA+ communities had long called for greater national coordination and investment in health, and many felt needs had not been met by the health system. The fact the announcement has happened here – at the largest LGBTIQA+ human rights conference ever held in the Asia Pacific region – is a sign of how far we have come in Australia when it comes to valuing and respecting our communities. The federal government will invest $26m in new health and medical research for LGBTQIA+ Australians, as well as a new health and wellbeing plan. The announcement has been hailed as a “gamechanger” by a leading health body. The health minister, Mark Butler, and assistant health minister, Ged Kearney, will announce the funding today, with Kearney attending a human rights conference connected to WorldPride in Sydney. Butler and Kearney said LGBTIQA+ people had “unique and often complex health needs, and difficulty getting appropriate health care, which can lead to poorer physical and mental health outcomes.” They will open a dedicated round of grants through the Medical Research Future Fund, which the government is calling the largest ever investment in LGBTIQA+ health research. The government will also announce a 10-year National Action Plan for the Health and Wellbeing of LGBTIQA+, to address health disparities and improve systems. Kearney is to convene a roundtable before the conference in Sydney, the first part of a major national consultation for the action plan that will be informed by a LGBTIQA+ Health Advisory Group. Kearney said: I’m proud of how far we’ve come and I’m even prouder to stand beside so many fierce advocates in the LBGTIQA+ community that have fought to get Australia where we are today – but the fight is not over. When the glitter washes away, we have real work to do and the new path to better health must be paved together. She said the government would work with community members, peak bodies and clinical experts to make Australia’s health system more “welcoming, supportive and effective”, and overcome what she called “unacceptable disparities in health outcomes and significant barriers” for LGBTIQA+ people. Butler said some LGBTIQA+ people still faced discrimination, stigma, isolation, harassment and violence, “all of which leads to poorer health and mental health”. As WorldPride celebrations continue in Sydney, there is no better time to demonstrate how committed this Government is to health equality. Darryl O’Donnell, CEO of the Australian Federation of Aids Organisations, said stigma and discrimination were still major barriers to accessing healthcare. More than one-in-four young LGBTQA+ people have attempted suicide at some point in their lives, while more than six-in-ten have sought counselling or other support. This investment promises to be a gamechanger. It will transform our understanding of LGBTIQA+ health and properly inform the scope, scale and character of health services needed to arrest the health crisis facing our communities. Shadow treasurer insists super tax changes are ‘super-sized broken election promise’ The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, is now speaking to ABC News Breakfast. While the government is saying they haven’t broken any election promises because these super changes won’t be introduced until after the next federal election, Taylor is saying the fact that the legislation is going to be put through this term undermines that. Michael Rowland: What’s wrong with voters getting to say yay or nay to this at the next election? Taylor: They won’t. Because the legislation is proposed to be put through in this term. So, this is a super-sized broken election promise. And it is very clear that Labor committed they wouldn’t make changes to superannuation taxation before the last election. And now, they’ve changed that. They’re going to put the legislation through in this term. If they were serious about putting it to an election, they would wait to put the legislation through after the next election. That’s not what they’re proposing. So it’s very clear that this is a breach of trust with the Australian people. The prime minister was unambiguous in saying there wouldn’t be changes to superannuation. PM: Opposition ‘are making themselves irrelevant’ on super tax changes and other issues Anthony Albanese is also trying to wedge the opposition over this. As Murph and Paul Karp have reported, the Coalition (minus a couple of MPs) are against the super changes. Jane Hume referred to it yesterday as “class welfare” (she meant class warfare). But the PM is willing to have a fight over these concessions for people with more than $3m in their super account. Albanese said: We’ll continue to pursue the case for reform in this area, like we’re continuing to pursue the case for reform, in housing, in dealing with climate change, in all of these issues. It’s a pity that the opposition are making themselves irrelevant. But we’ll talk to the crossbench about these issues like we’re having to talk to them about other issues, because the Coalition sitting on the sidelines, throwing rocks – they created the problem of a trillion dollars debt. They just don’t want to be part of any of the solution. So will everything be done this way then? Any changes will be set for after the next election? Anthony Albanese: No, I think on this measure is the right thing to do. And we have obviously had a discussion about it – cabinet met yesterday – it was something that I strongly supported, ensuring that any changes were after the election. So it’s very clear that we are being upfront about what our intentions are. And that is why doing it after the election makes that very clear. PM says negative gearing will not change Same goes for negative gearing, which independent senator David Pocock wants the government to look at. That’s a big no from Anthony Albanese. Albanese says: He has a range of proposals, and good luck to him. Albanese says the government is operating on whether or not something is fair. But is it fair for someone to have multiple properties which they are negatively gearing in order to build more wealth? Albanese doesn’t engage. We announced exactly what we are doing yesterday. And the sort of … speculative thing about someone who’s an independent [raising] some issue has no track with me whatsoever. Karvelas interrupts to ask whether there would be any changes to things like capital gains tax. That’s because Jim Chalmers was asked to play a fun game of rule in, rule out on some of his interviews, including on the Seven network. Chalmers did not rule in or rule out anything. That opened a door which Albanese has slammed shut when it comes to capital gains concessions. We are not. We are not going to impact the family home … Full stop, exclamation mark. Asked why not, Albanese says “we’re not going to” and when asked why not again, he says “because it is a bad idea”. Albanese: It’s a bad idea because people who save for their home, that you know that they live in with their family, is something that we have no intention – we will not be making any changes there. And no one I have never heard in all of the meetings that I’ve been to, over the years – and I’ve been to a few of the Labor party, cabinet caucus and branch meeting – I have never heard anyone raise that as a proposition. So far in this interview, Anthony Albanese is sticking to the main lines. No matter how hard Patricia Karvelas tries, the PM is not moving away from talking about the modest concessions it has put forward over tax concessions for people with more than $3m in their super account. The RN Breakfast host is trying to pin down whether or not there will be wider reforms of tax concessions, given what we saw in the tax expenditure statement yesterday. The PM is not biting. This was a treasury statement. It wasn’t a statement by the cabinet, if you like. This was just a statement of fact [of the situation] that we’re in, which we’re compulsorily required to do under the budget as part of the honesty provisions; what we’ve done is release more information. It’s more honest than it’s been in the past … Emergency room wait times improve for second quarter in a row in NSW NSW’s department of health says despite a record number of critical presentations, emergency department wait times has improved for the second quarter in a row. The Bureau of Health has released the report for the final quarter of last year (October – December 2022) which it says shows the health system is recovering from the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, despite ongoing high demand. NSW Health deputy secretary, adjunct professor Matthew Daly, said there were more than 790,000 attendances at the state’s emergency departments throughout the final quarter of 2022 and a record number in the most critical categories. Despite the huge volume of patients, the proportion of all ED patients who started their treatment on time and the number of patients whose care was transferred from paramedics to ED staff within 30 minutes improved. For the second quarter in a row we are seeing some positive signs in our results, which is testament to our dedicated staff and their outstanding performance through another challenging quarter. After 12 years in the political wilderness Labor could be poised to form the next NSW government, according to a new poll. With less than three weeks before the 25 March state election, the Resolve Political Monitor poll is pointing to a majority Labor victory. However, while 76% of voters polled said they were committed to who they planned to vote for, 24% were still uncertain. The survey of 803 eligible voters published in the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday was conducted between February 22-26. It found Labor’s primary vote had increased one percentage point to 38%, while the coalition’s had dropped two points to 32%. With 93 seats up for grabs, the data points to an overall swing of 7% to Labor – enough to deliver the 47 seats required to form a majority government. The Liberal premier, Dominic Perrottet, remains the preferred premier over Labor’s Chris Minns, at 38% to 34%. Resolve director Jim Reed told the Herald a majority Labor government followed by a minority government were the most likely outcomes of the election. He said: However, the comments we receive from respondents tell us that they are still not fully engaged, and a quarter of them tell us they are not committed to their current vote choice. The poll also showed support for independents had increased, with a primary vote of 13% compared with 5% in the 2019 election. - AAP Chalmers reaffirms the government wants to include the defined benefits scheme, which apply to politicians’ and public servants’ pensions, in the changes: Yes, we’re trying to include the defined benefits schemes in this. There’s a lot of complexity in this. Our intention is to include defined benefit. What we said is that there’s an opportunity now, between yesterday’s announcement and the budget in May, to engage in some meaningful consultation … One of the things that we do want to engage on and consult on is how we include defined benefit in the changes we have announced. It’s not unusual for governments to do that. In 2016 when the Liberals increased taxes on super, they found a way to factor in defined benefit. We have got a similar objective here. And we’ll work with the sector to try and get it right. Chalmers is pressed on the other tax concessions in the budget such as the $24bn a year in tax concessions for landlords, as well as a similar amount for discounted capital gains tax for people selling investment profits, but he says the government’s only focus is super. We made it really clear yesterday that our focus in the system is on these superannuation tax concessions. $150bn worth of concessions in the top 10 of those tax breaks by value – a third of that is superannuation. But it’s not just Jim Chalmers who is out and about. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is also up early and doing the big sell. You’ll hear from the PM on ABC radio RN Breakfast very soon. Good morning from Canberra, where it is the Jim Chalmers show. The treasurer has been everywhere this morning. Chalmers has had back-to-back interviews as he sells the government’s plan to reform superannuation tax breaks for people with more than $3m in their account. It’s not happening until after the next election, but is a very small move towards tax concession reform and, as he was yesterday, Chalmers is making it very clear that only 0.5 % of superannuates will be affected. Chalmers continues to defend the changes, saying they are not a broken election promise because they come in after the next election. The treasurer frames the choice Australians will have in terms of the potential for the opposition leader to make savings via cuts to Medicare: We are taking it to the voters. The outcome of that election will determine if we make this modest change or if Peter Dutton comes after Medicare or finds the money some other way. That will be one of the choices that people will make at the next election. Good morning! Thanks to Martin for getting things started! Let’s jump straight in with the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, who is speaking to ABC News about those superannuation changes announced yesterday. Asked about why the federal cabinet moved so quickly to bring in these changes, Chalmers denies the government was worried about the conversation getting away from them in consultation: We thought it was important to make clear our intention to make this modest but meaningful change to superannuation tax concessions, so we can make super a bit more sustainable and affordable and make the budget a bit more responsible. We take seriously the fact we inherited that trillion dollars of debt and deficits as far as the eye can see and intensifying pressures on the budget. We need to do something about it. What this change means is that 99.5% of Australians will be unaffected. For that 0.5% with large superannuation balances, they’ll still be able to access generous tax breaks on that super, just a bit less generous than before. As you rightly identify in the your introduction, the change doesn’t come in until after the next election. Thirteen regional local government areas around the country recorded a jump in net internal migration levels of more than 100 percent through 2022 – with regional Queensland and Victoria taking the largest share of movers, according to the December quarter regional movers index by the Commonwealth Bank and Regional Australia Institute. This included the top five highest growth regional areas of Port Pirie (South Australia), Gladstone (Queensland), Murray Bridge (South Australia), Glen Innes (New South Wales), York (Western Australia) which all recorded a jump of more than 200% in 2022. Net internal migration is a key driver of change in a region’s total population. It calculates the number of people from outside the region (but still within Australia) moving in, less the number of local people leaving that region for another (within Australia). Housing disruption caused by the pandemic was a big factor driving people away from cities, the report says. It shows movement between regional areas also rose in 2022, averaging 8% higher than the two years before the pandemic. Region-to-region migration increased by 2.2% in the December quarter, the second highest level since the pandemic began. “These disruptions are affecting housing and rental affordability, particularly for low-income regional dwellers previously able to access and afford housing,” the report said. “Part of the increase in inter-regional migration is likely reflecting people searching for and relocating to other places where housing is more available and affordable.” The Albanese government will axe “undeliverable” infrastructure projects announced by the Coalition when in power, warning that amid a shortage of roughly 100,000 workers across construction, projects that deliver better returns should be prioritised. In a speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday, Catherine King, the minister for infrastructure, transport and regional development will also criticise the previous government for neglecting the management of key national highways and rail tracks. King will note that while there are almost 190,000 Australians working on public infrastructure projects, there is demand for 283,400 workers across the sector. That shortfall of 94,000 is predicted to peak at 112,000 workers in September, with shortages of engineers, surveyors, project managers and labourers the most pronounced. The shortage will come amid the rising cost of many construction materials. As a result, King will say “we can’t build everything at once” and that “we have to be strategic and we have to ensure that we don’t add to inflationary pressures”. Without getting too political – we have to work out which projects are actually deliverable, and which were just political window dressing. These are not easy decisions to take, but I would rather be honest with people now than do what the previous government did – building hope that a undeliverable project would one day be built Criticising the previous government’s attitude to infrastructure, King will say: The simple fact is that the past decade, where we have had the Liberal and National parties treat the infrastructure investment pipeline as their election fund, has been one of significant lost opportunity. They chose to spend money on commuter car parks, urban congestion projects and roads of strategic importance that miraculously seemed to largely only be needed in Liberal and National party-held seats. That is why I am so determined that commonwealth investment is targeted – that we invest in the projects that deliver productivity growth, connect communities and deliver both economic and social returns. Rajwinder Singh to arrive in Australia after extradition from India Rajwinder Singh, the man accused of murdering Toyah Cordingley on a beach in Queensland, is reportedly on the way back to Australia, after boarding a Qantas flight from New Delhi to Melbourne on Tuesday evening. An Indian court approved the 38-year-old’s extradition in January, after Singh, an Australian national of Indian origin, waived his right to challenge the request. Singh is suspected in the alleged murder of Cordingley, the 24-year-old who was killed while out walking her dog on Wangetti beach north of Cairns in Queensland in October 2018, in a case that sent shock waves across the country. Her body was discovered half-buried in the sand dunes and police said she had been killed in a “personal and intimate attack”. Singh, a father of three who was working as a nurse in Australia, is said to have boarded a flight to India soon after the killing, prompting a four-year search by Australian police. In January, outside an Indian court, he said “I did not kill the woman” and wanted to reveal all the details to an Australian court. The ABC reports that Singh boarded the flight to Melbourne after being escorted by seven police officers from Delhi’s Tihar prison to the airport. The BBC says he will first appear in court in Victoria, before being moved to Queensland where the crime allegedly took place, to face a magistrate in Brisbane probably later this week before being remanded in custody. Morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I’m Martin Farrer bringing you the top overnight stories before my colleague Natasha May comes along to take you through the day. Among our top stories this morning is an exclusive warning that the voice to parliament referendum is “really susceptible to misinformation”, according to a leading communications expert advising the government. He adds the referendum expected later this year is “poised on a knife-edge” because voters may make up their minds far later in the campaign than at a standard election. The Albanese government will axe “undeliverable” infrastructure projects announced by the Coalition when in power, warning that amid a shortage of roughly 100,000 workers across construction, projects that deliver better returns should be prioritised. The infrastructure minister, Catherine King, will announce the cuts at the National Press Club today. Inflation figures will be released later this morning with expectations that it will have fallen slightly in January to 8%, from 8.4% in December. But the Reserve Bank is still expected to hike the cash rate a couple more times this year. And one reaction by people to higher costs has been to move into regional areas from cities, according to a new report today. Thirteen regional local government areas recorded a jump in net internal migration levels of more than 100% through 2022 – according to the regional movers index by the Commonwealth bank and Regional Australia Institute. Hopefully not too far from the bank."

                    "headline": "Boris Johnson’s allies doubtful he could make comeback",
                    "bodyText": "Boris Johnson’s supporters are increasingly doubtful he could make a comeback as prime minister after being “humiliated” over his post-Brexit deal with the European Union. Though allies have been agitating for Johnson’s return in an attempt to try to reverse the Conservatives’ stubbornly low poll ratings, some privately conceded the appetite among sceptics of Rishi Sunak to challenge their leader was depleting. A significant sign that the tide had turned against Johnson came when Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former Commons leader, urged fellow Tory MPs to “calm down and live with the leader we’ve got”. Though Rees-Mogg said he had been the “boy who stood on the burning deck” by supporting Johnson until the bitter end, he told ITV: “If we’re a grown-up party we cannot change leader again between now and an election.” Some hardcore loyalists of Johnson remain confident he could sweep back into No 10 after a “spanking” for the Conservative party in the spring local elections. A senior Tory source said they had been approached by those still close to the former prime minister for “informal conversations about the future” – but those had never come to fruition. “The fight’s gone out of most people,” the source said. “There’s not a lot of coordination any more.” Several MPs who were part of the roughly 100 that supported Johnson’s attempt to re-run for Conservative leader in October privately said they believed the clamour for him to return was waning. “We are getting close to the general [election], it’s just around the corner,” confessed one. “We’ve run out of time for Boris’s antics.” Another believed that Johnson had been “humiliated” by Sunak’s announcement this week, and suggested there was a “total reverse ferret” – journalistic parlance for a U-turn – from those who had been threatening to resign to damage the prime minister’s position. Despite a Johnson supporter warning that scrapping his Northern Ireland protocol bill could bring 100 Tory MPs to rebel, the former prime minister has so far made no critical comment about the Windsor framework unveiled by Sunak on Monday. In a sign that Johnson does not want to appear openly hostile, the Guardian understands he is set to attend the two-day away event being hosted by Sunak for all Conservative MPs beginning on Thursday in Berkshire. Robert Hayward, a Conservative peer and elections expert, said the prime minister’s new Northern Ireland deal was the “first significant event” since taking office that had “put the Johnson supporters heavily on the back foot”. “It hasn’t pushed Johnson away but it has diminished his potential influence,” said Hayward. Noting the implicit criticism of Sunak and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, he added: “I can’t think in recent years of any politician for whom there has been such a battering in absentia.” Tobias Ellwood, a Tory MP who had the whip temporarily stripped by Johnson, said the Windsor framework had shown that “our standard of statecraft has moved up a couple of gears”. He said: “Bombastic populism may rally a small base but does not appeal to the wider electorate whose support is needed to win elections.” Johnson was also accused of being outrageously disloyal by Rory Stewart, a former Tory cabinet minister. “Although I loathe him – I think he is a terrible person, terrible prime minister – [he] is still popular with many people in the Conservative party,” Stewart told LBC. Johnson was absent from the Commons chamber for Sunak’s victory speech on the rewritten Northern Ireland protocol, but he did make an appearance to push for greater nuclear investment on Tuesday. In a jibe at the former prime minister’s ambitions, Ed Miliband, the ex-Labour leader, told him from the dispatch box: “It is important to welcome ex-party leaders to their place. My only advice is that it is important to not want your old job back.” A spokesman for Johnson says he was “supporting the government” and “continues to campaign on issues including Ukraine and levelling up”. They added: “He is campaigning in his constituency and in parliament.”"

                    "headline": "UK energy firms must pass on price savings to customers, ministers warn",
                    "bodyText": "Ministers have warned energy firms that they must pass on the benefits of lower wholesale prices to consumers, amid concern that bills could rise this spring. In a speech on Wednesday, Grant Shapps will tell energy suppliers that reduced wholesale prices must be seen in consumer prices, “no ifs, buts or maybes”. In an apparent sign of government concern about the impact of reduced direct support for domestic energy bills, the energy secretary will spell out his message in a speech at the Chatham House thinktank in London. “I have one overriding mission in this new job: for the UK to have amongst the cheapest wholesale electricity prices in Europe,” said Shapps, whose formal brief changed from being business and energy secretary to energy security and net – zero secretary amid a mini-reshuffle and restructuring earlier in February. “This is critical to consumers, to our country and to our planet,” he added. “Making the most of our position as a world-leaders in renewables and nuclear technology, homegrown sources that will shield households from the worst excesses of the volatile global fossil-fuel markets. And suppliers must be ready to pass those savings on to consumers.” Ministers face pressure to postpone the reduction in support for consumer energy bills due in April, given the impact on cost of living pressures. On Monday, the energy regulator, Ofgem, said its energy cap – the amount suppliers can charge for average dual fuel, direct debit customers – would fall by 23% for the three months from 1 April to £3,280, from £4,279 for the January to March quarter. However, the reduction in government help means that the actual price paid by an average household will rise from £2,100 a year in April to £3,000. Wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply in recent months but the drop is yet to feed through into household bills because suppliers buy their energy months in advance. Shapps’ speech, extracts of which were released in advance by his department, will also focus on wider energy security issues, with a pledge that “never again should [Vladimir] Putin or anyone like him even think they can hold the UK to ransom”. The government has promised to invest heavily in domestic-based energy sources, including nuclear power, renewables and some continued fossil fuel extraction. The latter has prompted protest groups to vow to obstruct this, with Shapps due to also promise action to tackle them. “Families have seen the impact on the pounds in their pockets of Putin’s illegal march on Ukraine a year ago – and it has opened the world’s eyes to just how vulnerable we are to tyrants like him,” he will say. “Working towards this overarching goal of cheaper wholesale electricity will mean we will be powering Britain from Britain, increasing our energy security and independence – the kind of independence that comes from having the four biggest windfarms off our shores. “And all this will be better for our planet – energy security and tackling climate change are ultimately two sides of the same coin. And it will be this – not the eco-extremists like Extinction Rebellion causing disruption and dismay – that will have people voting with their feet as they see the benefits of achieving net zero.”"

                    "bodyText": "This blog is now closed. You can catch up on the latest Ukraine war coverage here. It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A senior Pentagon official has said the US did not expect Russia to make significant territorial gains in Ukraine in the near term and described the frontlines of the war as a “grinding slog”. Colin Kahl, the US undersecretary of defence for policy, told a House of Representatives hearing: “I do not think that there’s anything I see that suggests the Russians can sweep across Ukraine and make significant territorial gains anytime in the next year or so.” A military drone attempted to strike a gas facility in the Moscow region, according to a senior Russian official, and photos of the wreckage suggested it was Ukrainian-made, indicating a rare attempted strike hundreds of miles behind Russian lines. The alleged attack was one of several reports of successful or attempted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) strikes in at least four regions of Russia. Russia’s Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg temporarily suspended all flights earlier today amid unconfirmed media reports of an unidentified object such as a drone being seen nearby. Some flights were diverted back to Moscow while the airport was shut for about an hour. Russia’s defence ministry later announced there had been a training exercise between air defences and civilian aviation authorities. Emergency services put out a fire at an oil depot in southern Russia overnight after a drone was spotted flying overhead, the RIA news agency said. The fire in the Russian town of Tuapse, Krasnador, was reported at 2.30am local time and spread to an area of about 200 sq metres before it was extinguished. “The oil tanks were not affected. There was no spill of oil products. No injuries,” said Sergei Boyko, who leads the local administration. The Russian defence ministry has stated that it foiled two attempted Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil using drones overnight. It said: “28 February, at night, the Kyiv regime attempted to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to attack civilian infrastructure in the Krasnodar territory and the Republic of Adygea.” The claims have not been independently verified. The military situation is becoming increasingly difficult around the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday, as many of Ukraine’s battlefields turn to mud. The Ukrainian president said in his nightly address: “The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions for fortification and defence.” Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces destroyed a Ukrainian ammunition depot near the town – the focal point of Russia’s advances in eastern Ukraine – also shooting down four Himars missiles and five drones launched by Ukrainian forces. Vladimir Putin has told Russia’s FSB security service to step up its intelligence activity and stop “sabotage groups” entering the country. In a speech to FSB officials, the Russian leader instructed the agency to strengthen its activity to counter what he described as growing espionage and sabotage operations against Russia by Ukraine and its western allies. He also admitted that FSB members had been killed in Ukraine. Russia is open to negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has said, but he insisted Moscow would “never compromise” on what he described as new “territorial realities”. Speaking to reporters during a regular briefing, Peskov said Moscow would not renounce its claims to four Ukrainian regions that Putin annexed in September. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has reiterated the Biden administration’s concern that China is considering providing lethal aid to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Speaking after a meeting with leaders in the Kazakh capital, Astana, Blinken warned that Beijing would face “implications and consequences” if it decided to provide such support. China has “very clearly” taken Russia’s side and has been “anything but an honest broker” in efforts to bring peace to Ukraine, the US department of state spokesperson Ned Price said at a news briefing yesterday. China has provided Russia with “diplomatic support, political support, with economic support, with rhetorical support”, he added. A hacking attack caused some Russian regional broadcasters to put out a false warning urging people to take shelter from an incoming missile attack, the emergencies ministry said. “As a result of the hacking of servers of radio stations and TV channels, in some regions of the country information about the announcement of an air alert was broadcast. This information is false and does not correspond to reality.” A similar attack caused commercial radio stations in some Russian regions to send air alarm messages on Wednesday last week. Ukraine will become a Nato member in the “long term”, the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. The Nato chief stressed that the immediate priority was Ukraine remaining an independent country in the face of the Russian invasion. He said Finland and Sweden’s bids to join the alliance were a “top priority” and that the Nordic countries have had the “quickest accession process in Nato’s modern history”. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and a close ally of the Putin, has arrived in Beijing for a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Vladimir Putin has formally signed a law suspending Russia’s participation in New Start, the last major remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the US, state media reported. The text of the law’s explanatory note read: The Russian Federation suspends the treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States of America on measures for the further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms, signed in Prague on April 8 2010. Russian state-run Tass news agency reported that the document was published today, and the law came into force as of the moment of its official publication. Putin announced the suspension of Russia’s participation in the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as New Start, earlier this month. “They want to inflict a strategic defeat on us and claim our nuclear facilities,” said Putin in a speech before the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In this regard, I am forced to state that Russia is suspending its participation in the strategic offensive arms treaty. Finland has begun construction of a 200km fence on the Russian border, the country’s border guard has announced. Terrain work would begin today “with forest clearance and will proceed in such a way that road construction and fence installation can be started in March”, the Finnish border guard said in a statement. The 3km pilot project at the border crossing near Imatra is expected to be completed by the end of June, it added. Construction of a further 70km, mainly in southeastern Finland, will take place between 2023 and 2025. The fence will be more than 3 metres tall with barbed wire at the top, and particularly sensitive areas will be equipped with night vision cameras, lights and loudspeakers. Currently, Finland’s borders are secured primarily by light wooden fences, mainly designed to stop livestock. Although the Finland-Russia border has “worked well” in the past, Brig Gen Jari Tolppanen told AFP in November that the war in Ukraine had changed the security situation “fundamentally” and that a border fence was “indispensable” to stop large-scale illegal entries from Russian territory. The head of the UN’s nuclear agency, Rafael Grossi, has expressed “concern” about Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, citing the facility’s “fragile” power situation, delays in staff rotations, an increased security presence onsite and nearby fighting. In a statement, the International Atomic Energy chief said: The sound of artillery fire near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) and the temporary loss of its only remaining back-up power line have again underlined persistent nuclear safety and security risks during the military conflict in the country. IAEA experts who have been at the plant since early January reported hearing about 20 “detonations” yesterday afternoon, “apparently in the vicinity of the plant, which is located on the frontline of an active combat area”. Grossi added: This is a concerning trend that shows the urgency and importance of establishing a nuclear safety and security protection zone at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, was captured by Russian forces in March 2022, soon after their invasion of Ukraine. The Chinese satellite firm Spacety provided satellite images to the Russian mercenary Wagner group, the US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Daniel Kritenbrink, told a congressional hearing today. Spacety was added to a US trade blacklist earlier this month for allegedly supporting the Russian military, along with another Chinese satellite company, China HEAD Aerospace Technology Co. Spacety, which was also put under sanctions by the US treasury department in January, at the time said it had complied with international sanctions against Russia. A senior Pentagon official has said the US did not expect Russia to make significant territorial gains in Ukraine in the near term and described the frontlines of the war as a “grinding slog”. Colin Kahl, the US undersecretary of defence for policy, told a House of Representatives hearing today: You may see small portions of territory change hands in the coming weeks and months. I do not think that there’s anything I see that suggests the Russians can sweep across Ukraine and make significant territorial gains anytime in the next year or so. Kahl was asked repeatedly by US lawmakers about sending the jets to Ukraine, Reuters reports. He replied: It is a priority for the Ukrainians, but it is not one of their top three priorities. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and a close ally of the Russian leader Vladimir Putin, has arrived in Beijing for a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. A military drone attempted to strike a gas facility in the Moscow region, according to a senior Russian official, and photos of the wreckage suggested it was Ukrainian-made, indicating a rare attempt to strike hundreds of miles behind Russian lines. The alleged attack was one of several reports of successful or attempted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) strikes in at least four regions of Russia. The Moscow region governor, Andrei Vorobyov, on Monday confirmed a UAV crash-landed in the village of Gubastovo near the capital and was apparently aiming for a “civilian infrastructure site”. The target was said to be a Gazprom gas compression station in the Moscow suburbs, just over 50 miles south-east of the Kremlin. Photographs of the drone posted to social media indicate it was a Ukrainian-made UJ-22. Ukraine does not publicly claim responsibility for attacks inside Russia. The UAV apparently clipped trees just before its target and landed 10 metres from the outer fence of the gas compression station, a Gazprom representative confirmed to Russian media. Ukrjet, the producer of the UJ-22, claims the drone can fly 500 miles (800km) and is armed with an interchangeable payload. The strike was among others launched on Tuesday. If they were launched from Ukrainian territory, then it would make them some of the most ambitious since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion last February.

A drone that was downed in the Moscow region had probably been intended to attack civil infrastructure, according to the region’s governor. The drone was downed earlier today near a gas distribution station close to the city of Kolomna, 70 miles (110km) south-east of Moscow, the Russian state-run Ria Novosti news agency reported, citing local emergency services.

The loss of an A-50 Mainstay plane would be significant as it is critical to Russian air operations in “providing an air battlespace picture”, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in response to earlier claims from Belarusian anti-war partisans to have severely damaged a Russian military aircraft on Sunday. BYPOL, the Belarusian partisan organisation, said it had used drones to strike the Machulishchy airfield, 12km from Minsk, severely damaging a Beriev A-50 airborne early-warning and control aircraft (Awacs). Poland will cut its oil imports from Russia to “close to zero” in February and March, the country’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. His remarks came after Poland’s largest oil company, PKN Orlen, said Russia had unexpectedly halted supplies of oil to Poland via the northern leg of the Druzhba pipeline. Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’m here to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has reiterated the Biden administration’s concern that China is considering providing lethal aid to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Speaking after a meeting with leaders in the Kazakh capital, Astana, Blinken warned that Beijing would face “implications and consequences” if it decided to provide such support. He said: We will not hesitate, for example, to target Chinese companies or individuals that violate our sanctions, or otherwise engage in supporting the Russian war effort. He said he had raised the issue directly with the top Chinese diplomat, Wang Yi, last week “because of concern we have based on information that we have, that China is considering moving beyond the non-lethal support that some of its companies have been providing to actually lethal material support for Russia’s war effort in Ukraine”. He added: China can’t have it both ways when it comes to the Russian aggression in Ukraine. It can’t be putting forward peace proposals on the one hand, while actually feeding the flames of the fire that Russia has started with the other hand. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that four fires have broken out in Kherson today as a result of Russian shelling. There are no casualties reported. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires from the besieged frontline city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. Vladimir Putin, speaking at an expanded board meeting of Russia’s FSB service, also admitted that FSB members had been killed in Ukraine. Putin said: Unfortunately, there are losses in our ranks. He was quoted by the state-run Ria Novosti news agency as saying: The leadership of the FSB must do everything to additionally support the families of our fallen comrades. We will always remember their heroism and courage. Putin added that “2022 was a special year for the whole country and for your service”, and said FSB units were “directly involved” in what he described as Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine. He said: I would like to thank the management and all employees of the department, especially those who acted at the forefront, in the liberated territories, in the frontline zone and, I would add, behind enemy lines. I want to thank you for this work, dear comrades. Vladimir Putin has told Russia’s FSB security service to step up its intelligence activity and stop “sabotage groups” entering the country. In a speech to FSB officials, reported by Reuters, the Russian leader instructed the agency to strengthen its activity to counter what he described as growing espionage and sabotage operations against Russia by Ukraine and its western allies. He ordered officials to step up the protection of key Russian infrastructure, and prevent any attempts by western security services to revive what he called “terrorist cells” on Russian territory. He said: Western intelligence services have traditionally always been actively working in Russia, and now they have thrown additional personnel, technical and other resources against us. We need to respond accordingly. He said the FSB had to prevent illegal weapons flows into Russia, and to strengthen security in four regions of Ukraine that he annexed last year, a move that has not been recognised by most UN countries. Oleh Bendyk showed off a video taken in Ukraine’s eastern forests. It shows a group of soldiers from Bendyk’s 103rd brigade sheltering in a sandy trench. Around them a battle rages. There are explosions, booms, and the rattle of small arms fire. A grad missile crashes down among the pine trees, in a large orange fireball. “Some bastards are firing at us from over there. But we can’t see who they are because of the forest,” a soldier says. He adds: A Grad now! Do you see how we get hit? It’s been like this since 7am. And now it’s 11am. That’s how it fucking is, folks! Bendyk and his fellow Ukrainian soldiers have been holding off a surging Russian offensive west of Kreminna, a city that Moscow captured last year. Further along the same front, Ukrainian soldiers are doggedly defending the town of Bakhmut, once home to 70,000 people. Fighting has gone on there for months. In his latest video address on Monday Volodymyr Zelenskiy acknowledged that the situation was “constantly becoming more difficult”. Bakhmut was “extremely tense”, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, confirmed. The “most prepared assault units” from the Wagner mercenary group were trying to break through and surround the city, he said. The Russian army and Wagner have been making incremental gains in the area. In January they took the nearby town of Soledar. So far they have been unable to capture the ruined centre of Bakhmut, despite multiple attempts. About half of Donetsk oblast in the Donbas region remains under Kyiv’s control, a year after Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion. According to Ukrainian intelligence, Russia’s president has ordered his military to seize all of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces by the end of March. A decisive Russian offensive has yet to happen. “That was an ordinary day,” Bendyk said of the hellish forest video, shot in late January. Some days are a lot worse, when our guys get injured or killed. The Russians have a lot of artillery. They go quadrant by quadrant. We need more counter-battery fire. Read the full story by my colleague Luke Harding here: Poland will cut its oil imports from Russia to “close to zero” n February and March, the country’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. Morawiecki said: At the beginning of this year imports from Russia decreased to 10% ... and February-March, from information I get from Orlen, it will be 0%, so a number close to zero. His remarks came after Poland’s largest oil company, PKN Orlen, said Russia had unexpectedly halted supplies of oil to Poland via the northern leg of the Druzhba pipeline. Ukraine “has always been Europe, Ukraine will always be Europe,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted on Twitter. The Ukrainian president said it was a year ago, on the fifth day of Russia’s invasion of his country, that Kyiv applied to join the EU. This year “is the time to decide on the launch of membership negotiations”, he said. He added: It’s Ukraine that has brought the EU together like never before. It’s Ukraine that’s defending European values for generations to come. It’s Ukraine where Europe becomes whole, free, and at peace. Together in struggle, together in victory. Ukraine will become a Nato member in the “long term”, the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. The Nato chief stressed that the immediate priority was Ukraine remaining an independent country in the face of the Russian invasion. Speaking at a joint press conference with Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, in Helsinki, Stoltenberg said: Nato allies have agreed that Ukraine will become a member of our alliance, but at the same time that is a long-term perspective. He said Finland and Sweden’s bids to join the alliance were a “top priority” and that the Nordic countries have had the “quickest accession process in Nato’s modern history”. Stoltenberg’s remarks came a day after Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said talks with Helsinki and Stockholm over their Nato membership bids would resume on 9 March. The US and other Nato member countries are hoping Finland and Sweden will become members at a Nato summit due to held on 11 July in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius. German-made Leopard tanks have been spotted near the besieged town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, according to an adviser to the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. Speaking to state broadcaster Russia 1, Yan Gagin said: There have been claims that Leopards have appeared near Artemovsk [the Russian name for Bakhmut]. He added that there was “no need to sensationalise” the presence of the Leopard tanks near the frontline. He said: Given the muddy weather now, it will make it difficult for heavy vehicles like the Leopard to move. [It] is the same armoured target as all the others. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian mercenary Wager group, on Sunday said there was information that Leopard tanks had arrived at Chasiv Yar, near Bakhmut, but that there had not yet been “encounters” with the tanks on the battlefield. A drone that was downed in the Moscow region had probably been intended to attack civil infrastructure, according to the region’s governor. The drone was downed earlier today near a gas distribution station close to the city of Kolomna, 110km (70 miles) south-east of Moscow, the Russian state-run Ria Novosti news agency reported, citing local emergency services. There was no damage to any infrastructure and no casualties, the governor said. Russia’s defence ministry earlier said it had foiled two attempted Ukrainian drone attacks on two southern Russian regions overnight. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian authorities. The claims have not been independently verified. Here are some images we have received from the news wires of Antony Blinken’s visit to Kazakhstan to meet top diplomats from all five former Soviet republics after the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The US secretary of state is meeting the foreign ministers of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in Astana today before travelling on to Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Blinken will stress the US “commitment to the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of central Asian countries”, the state department said in a statement that mirrored the wording it has been using to support Ukraine in its war against Russia. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has said that Russia is open to negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine, but insisted Moscow would “never compromise” on what he described as new “territorial realities”. Speaking to reporters during a regular briefing, Peskov said Moscow would not renounce its claims to four Ukrainian regions that Vladimir Putin annexed in September. The Russian president signed “accession treaties” formalising Russia’s annexation of the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk regions after Kremlin-orchestrated fake referendums that Ukraine and the west consider illegal. Peskov said: There are certain realities that have already become an internal factor. I mean the new territories. The constitution of the Russian Federation exists, and cannot be ignored. Russia will never be able to compromise on this. These are important realities. He said Moscow was open to talks if Kyiv accepted its control over those regions. Russian forces do not fully control any of the four regions. Peskov added: With a favourable state of affairs and the appropriate attitude from the Ukrainians, this can be resolved at the negotiating table. But the main thing is to achieve our goals.

Russia’s Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg temporarily suspended all flights on Tuesday amid unconfirmed media reports of an unidentified object such as a drone being seen nearby. Some flights were diverted back to Moscow while the airport was shut for about an hour. Russia’s ministry of defence later announced there had been a training exercise between air defences and civilian aviation authorities. Emergency services put out a fire at an oil depot in southern Russia overnight after a drone was spotted flying overhead, the RIA news agency said on Tuesday. The fire in the Russian town of Tuapse, Krasnador, was reported at 2.30am local time and spread to an area of about 200 sq metres before it was extinguished. “The oil tanks were not affected. There was no spill of oil products. No injuries,” said Sergei Boyko, who leads the local administration. The Russian ministry of defence has stated that it foiled two attempted Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil using drones overnight. It said: “28 February, at night, the Kyiv regime attempted to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to attack civilian infrastructure in the Krasnodar territory and the Republic of Adygea.” A hacking attack caused some Russian regional broadcasters to put out a false warning on Tuesday urging people to take shelter from an incoming missile attack, the emergencies ministry said. “As a result of the hacking of servers of radio stations and TV channels, in some regions of the country information about the announcement of an air alert was broadcast. This information is false and does not correspond to reality.” A similar attack caused commercial radio stations in some Russian regions to send air alarm messages on Wednesday last week. The military situation is becoming increasingly difficult around the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday as many of Ukraine’s battlefields turn to mud. “In the Bakhmut sector, the situation is constantly becoming more difficult,” the Ukrainian president said in his nightly address. “The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions for fortification and defence.” Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces destroyed a Ukrainian ammunition depot near the town – the focal point of Russia’s advances in eastern Ukraine – also shooting down four Himars missiles and five drones launched by Ukrainian forces. The loss of an A-50 Mainstay would be significant as it is critical to Russian air operations for “providing an air battlespace picture”, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in response to earlier claims from Belarusian anti-war partisans to have severely damaged a Russian military aircraft on Sunday. China has “very clearly” taken Russia’s side and has been “anything but an honest broker” in efforts to bring peace to Ukraine, US department of state spokesperson Ned Price said at a news briefing on Monday. China has provided Russia with “diplomatic support, political support, with economic support, with rhetorical support”, he added. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Tuesday pledged support for Kazakhstan’s independence on a trip to boost influence in central Asia. The airline carrier Wizz Air has announced it will suspend flights to Moldova’s capital, Chișinău, from 14 March because of concerns about the safety of its airspace. In a statement, the company said it had taken the “difficult but responsible” decision to suspend flights because of the “high, but not imminent” risk in Moldova’s airspace. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back with you later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you shortly to continue our live coverage. The Russian ministry of defence has stated that it foiled two attempted Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil using drones overnight. It said: 28 February, at night, the Kyiv regime attempted to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to attack civilian infrastructure in the Krasnodar territory and the Republic of Adygea. The UAVs were suppressed by the electronic warfare units of the Russian Federation armed forces. Both drones lost control and deviated from their flight path. One UAV fell in a field, another UAV, deviating from the trajectory, did not harm the attacked civilian infrastructure facility. The claims have not been independently verified. Russian news sources including Tass are carrying a statement from the Russian ministry of defence which claims that the closure of airspace around St Petersburg this morning was part of a training exercise. Tass quotes a ministry statement saying: On 28 February, the duty forces of the western zone of responsibility for air defence conducted a training session on interaction with civilian air traffic control authorities. During the training, the duty air defence forces worked out the issues of detecting, intercepting and identifying the alleged target of the intruder, as well as interacting with emergency services and law enforcement agencies in the event of an emergency situation. Unverified media reports in Russia had earlier claimed that the closure was due to an unidentified object being spotted near the airport. Oleksiy Sorokin of the Kyiv Independent points out how far away the oil depot in Tuapse is from Ukraine’s territory. [See 8.48 GMT] Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted to the Telegram messaging app to celebrate the anniversary of Ukraine applying to become a member of the European Union. He writes: A year ago, on the fifth day of the full-scale war, we applied for Ukraine’s accession to the European Union. We obtained the candidacy. This year is the time to decide on the launch of membership negotiations. It is with Ukraine that the majestic project of a peaceful, free and united Europe will be complete. We are together in the struggle, and therefore we will be together in victory. Long live Europe. Long live freedom. Here are some of the latest images from Ukraine sent to us over the news wires. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was kept fully informed about a temporary airspace ban over the city of St Petersburg on Tuesday, the Kremlin said, but it declined to comment further on what caused the hour-long disruption to flights, Reuters reports. The Wikimedia Foundation was fined 2m roubles (£22k) in Russia on Tuesday over what authorities said was its failure to remove “fake information” about Russia’s actions in Ukraine from the Wikipedia website, Reuters reports. Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the president of Ukraine, has posted on Telegram to say that one person was killed and a private residential building was destroyed by shelling this morning in Kherson. A hacking attack caused some Russian regional broadcasters to put out a false warning on Tuesday urging people to take shelter from an incoming missile attack, the emergencies ministry has said. “As a result of the hacking of servers of radio stations and TV channels, in some regions of the country information about the announcement of an air alert was broadcast,” Reuters reports the ministry said in a statement. “This information is false and does not correspond to reality.” Among the regions where the fake messages were broadcast was Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in a move not widely internationally recognised. On regional TV an image was shown with a symbol of a man running for cover from incoming missiles and a message reading “Everybody to the shelter, now,” according to images posted on social media. A similar attack caused commercial radio stations in some Russian regions to send air alarm messages last Wednesday. Tass reports that flights at Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg have been resumed. Flights were stopped after an unknown object was reportedly spotted flying near it. Russia’s Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg has temporarily suspended all flights on Tuesday, the city government has said, amid unconfirmed Russian media reports of an unidentified object, such as a drone, above the city. Reuters reports that the government of Russia’s second city said on its official Telegram channel that it had halted all flights at the airport until noon local time (9am GMT). It did not provide a reason for the suspension. The state-run Tass news agency said airspace within a 200km (124-mile) radius of Pulkovo had been closed until 1.20pm local time (10.20 GMT), citing an unnamed source. An unconfirmed media report from online Russian news outlet Baza said an unidentified object had been spotted in the sky and that fighter jets had been dispatched to investigate. Emergency services put out a fire at an oil depot in southern Russia overnight after a drone was spotted flying overhead, the RIA news agency said on Tuesday. The fire in the Russian town of Tuapse was reported at 2.30am local time (23.30pm Monday GMT) and spread to an area of about 200 sq metres before it was extinguished, Reuters notes a local official said. “The oil tanks were not affected. There was no spill of oil products. No injuries,” said Sergei Boyko, who leads the local administration. Tuapse lies on Russia’s southern coast, about 240 km (149 miles) south-east of the Crimean peninsula. Moscow has reported sporadic incidents at oil and gas infrastructure in regions near Ukraine since the war started a year ago. Russian officials have often blamed Kyiv for sending drones into Russian territory. Tass reports that the airspace within a radius of 200km (124 miles) of St Petersburg’s Pulkovo airport is closed until 10.20am GMT (1.20pm local time). Russia’s Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg has now temporarily suspended all flights on Tuesday, the city government said on its Telegram channel. Reuters reports that it did not provide a reason. The stoppage will last until 9am GMT (noon local time). There are also unconfirmed reports on social media that a fire broke out overnight at the oil refinery in Tuapse in Russia’s Krasnodar region. Tuapse sits near the coast of the Black Sea, south of Crimea and north of Sochi. The unconfirmed speculation is that it was struck by a drone attack. Images purportedly from the scene show a pillar of smoke rising into the air, and a fire on the grounds of the refinery. Reuters is reporting that a number of Russian domestic flights to St Petersburg were turned back to their departure points on Tuesday, according to the Flight Radar flight-tracking website. At least five flights en route from the capital, Moscow, to St Petersburg had been turned back towards Moscow as of 8am GMT (11am local time), after initially circling in the air, flight paths on Flight Radar showed. It was not immediately clear why, though Reuters said that an unconfirmed media report from online Russian news outlet Baza claimed an unidentified object had been spotted in the sky and that fighter jets had been dispatched to investigate. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne has offered this round-up of overnight events on its Telegram channel, writing: At night, Russian troops shelled Sviatohirsk in Donetsk region – they hit a part of the state emergency service. A rescuer was killed and four others were injured. Also at night, the Russian army shelled Zelenivka near Kherson, no people were injured. Over the past 24 hours, one person was killed and nine others were injured in the shelling by the Russian army in Donetsk region. Three people were injured in the Kherson region. Russian troops continue to advance in five directions. In the last day, defence forces repelled more than 60 attacks, as well as destroyed 12 drones and struck four areas where the Russian army was concentrated. The claims have not been independently verified. The regional government in Sumy, in Ukraine’s north-east, recorded 36 strikes on its territory in overnight Russian shelling, according to reports from Ukraine’s state broadcaster, Suspilne. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Tuesday pledged support for Kazakhstan’s independence on a trip to boost influence in central Asia, which has been rattled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “As you know well, the US strongly supports Kazakhstan’s sovereignty, its independence, its territorial integrity,” Blinken said as he met his Kazakh counterpart. “Sometimes we just say those words and they actually have no meaning. And of course, in this particular time, they have even more resonance than usual,” Blinken said, referring to Russia’s assault on Ukraine. Blinken said the US was “determined to make even stronger” its relationship with Kazakhstan. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London from my colleague Samantha Lock in Sydney. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com The loss of an A-50 Mainstay would be significant as it is critical to Russian air operations for “providing an air battlespace picture”, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in response to earlier claims from Belarusian anti-war partisans to have severely damaged a Russian military aircraft on Sunday. BYPOL, the Belarusian partisan organisation, said it had used drones to strike the Machulishchy airfield 12km from Minsk, severely damaging a Beriev A-50 airborne early warning and control aircraft (Awacs). Attribution and damage has not been officially corroborated. However, the loss of an A-50 Mainstay would be significant as it is critical to Russian air operations for providing an air battlespace picture,” the latest British intelligence report reads. This will likely leave 6 operational A-50s in service, further constraining Russian air operations.” The commander of Ukrainian ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, says the situation around the besieged town of Bakhmut is “extremely tense”. Despite significant losses, the enemy threw in the most prepared assault units of Wagner, who are trying to break through the defences of our troops and surround the city,” Syrskyi was quoted as saying on the Ukraine’s media military centre Telegram messaging platform on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s head of military intelligence has brushed aside claims that China is considering furnishing arms to Russia, telling US media that he saw no “signs that such things are even being discussed”. Senior US officials voiced concerns that they were “confident” China was considering providing lethal equipment to Moscow. But when asked about the possibility in an interview with Voice of America published on Monday, Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said: I do not share this opinion … As of now, I do not think that China will agree to the transfer of weapons to Russia. I do not see any signs that such things are even being discussed.” Earlier this month, US secretary of state Antony Blinken aired Washington’s concerns about potential arms shipments in a tense meeting with his Chinese counterpart, and the director of the CIA said on Sunday that he believed Beijing was still weighing the possibility. Asked specifically about the US assessment, Budanov said: “I am the head of intelligence and I rely, with all due respect, not on the opinions of individual people, but only on facts. I do not see such facts.” China has more sophisticated technology and resources at its disposal to possibly provide to Russian forces in Ukraine, US department of state spokesperson Ned Price said at a news briefing on Monday. Price noted the impact of the provision of Iranian-produced drones, or UAVs, has had in Ukraine in targeting civilian sites and energy infrastructure but warned the consequences of Chinese involvement could be “potentially dire and tragic”. According to a transcript of the press briefing published by the US department of state, Price said: Now, of course the PRC has at its disposal technology and resources that Iran doesn’t have, and so one could imagine the implications of the provision of significant amounts of lethal assistance. It’s for that reason that we don’t want to see it happen. We’re continuing to warn very clearly about the consequences that would befall Beijing should it proceed down this path. Ultimately, Beijing is going to have to make its own sovereign decision. Our goal is to see to it that Beijing makes informed decisions … there would be costs and there would be consequences if the PRC were to go down this route.” China has “very clearly” taken Russia’s side and has been “anything but an honest broker” in efforts to bring peace to Ukraine, US department of state spokesperson Ned Price said at a news briefing on Monday. Although China has “attempted to maintain this veneer of neutrality” it has provided Russia with “diplomatic support, political support, with economic support, with rhetorical support”, Price told reporters. According to a transcript of the press briefing published by the US department of state, Price said: The PRC has told the world that, essentially, it is not taking a position, but rather it has tried to portray itself as an honest broker. In word and in deed, however, the PRC has been anything but an honest broker. Leaving aside the question of lethal assistance – which we don’t believe the PRC has provided yet, but we do believe it is considering – leaving that aside, the PRC has already provided important forms of assistance to Russia, including in the context of its aggression against Ukraine. It’s provided Russia with diplomatic support, with political support, with economic support, with rhetorical support, including by parroting Russia’s dangerous propaganda, dangerous lies, and disinformation on the world stage.” Price added that he hopes China “begins to use its influence in a constructive way”. There are countries around the world that, if they sought to bring this war to an end, would have a significant amount of leverage with the Russian Federation, with other key countries. The PRC certainly falls within that category. But to date, at least, despite the PRC’s protests to the contrary, we have seen them very clearly take a side in this war.” Price continued: So if China were serious about seeking to bring an end to this war, it would have influence, it would have leverage over the government in Moscow that we would hope it would use in a constructive way. It does give us pause, concern, that … the PRC has engaged with Russia, including with high-level visits, Wang Yi’s visit to Moscow just within recent days, even while the PRC is not engaged symmetrically with Ukraine.” As the battles continue to rage across eastern Ukraine, here are some of the latest images to be sent over our newswires today. The military situation is becoming increasingly difficult around Bakhmut, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday as many of Ukraine’s battlefields turn to mud and Russian forces attempt to close ring around the eastern Ukrainian town. Zelenskiy said in his Monday night address: Bakhmut direction – the situation is getting more and more difficult. The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions, to gain a foothold and ensure defence.” Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces destroyed a Ukrainian ammunition depot near the town – the focal point of Russia’s advances in eastern Ukraine – also shooting down four Himars missiles and five drones launched by Ukrainian forces. “The number of enemy personnel is increasing,” Ukraine’s general staff said, adding that six nearby Donetsk settlements came under Russian shelling. Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence, said Russia is “increasing the intensity of its assaults” using “tactics of exhaustion and total destruction”. In a Telegram post late on Monday night, she said: To put it briefly and simply: the situation at the front is complicated. The enemy army is increasing the intensity of its assaults. The most difficult situation remains in the Bakhmut direction. During offensive operations, the enemy uses tactics of exhaustion and total destruction. At the same time, the enemy is suffering significant losses, losing from 600 to 1,000 people daily.” In the Donetsk region, suddenly warmer weather has softened the frozen ground, turning battlefields into mud. The spring thaw can turn roads into rivers and fields into impenetrable bogs. “Both sides stay in their positions, because as you see, spring means mud. Thus, it is impossible to move forward,” one Ukrainian commander told Reuters. Russia is trying to encircle Bakhmut, forcing Ukraine to pull out its garrison. That would give Moscow its first major prize in more than half a year after Russia intensified its attacks on several locations along the front in the east. The fierce fighting for the industrial city has been the longest-running battle of Russia’s year-long invasion. Moscow’s troops have made clear, if slow, progress north and south of Bakhmut, attempting to cut off Ukrainian forces inside the ruined city, which once held around 75,000 people. “Vicious battles are going on there. The command is doing everything it can to stop the enemy from advancing through our territory,” Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern military command, told Ukrainian television. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and this will be the last time I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold. The military situation around Bakhmut, the focal point of Russia’s advances in eastern Ukraine, is becoming “increasingly difficult”, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Russian forces appear to be making more strident attempts to close ring around the eastern Ukrainian town as Ukraine’s eastern military command describes “vicious battles” to stop Russian troops from advancing further through the territory. US officials say China has “very clearly” taken Russia’s side and has been “anything but an honest broker” in efforts to bring peace to Ukraine. US department of state spokesperson Ned Price made the comments during a news briefing on Monday, claiming China has provided Russia with “diplomatic support, political support, with economic support, with rhetorical support”. It’s 7.30am in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The military situation is becoming increasingly difficult around the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday as many of Ukraine’s battlefields turn to mud. “In the Bakhmut sector, the situation is constantly becoming more difficult,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address. “The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions for fortification and defence.” Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces destroyed a Ukrainian ammunition depot near the town – the focal point of Russia’s advances in eastern Ukraine – also shooting down four Himars missiles and five drones launched by Ukrainian forces. Belarusian anti-war partisans claim to have severely damaged a Russian military aircraft in what an opposition leader has called the “most successful diversion” since the beginning of the war. BYPOL, the Belarusian partisan organisation, said it had used drones to strike the Machulishchy airfield 12km from Minsk, severely damaging a Beriev A-50 airborne early warning and control aircraft (Awacs). China has “very clearly” taken Russia’s side and has been “anything but an honest broker” in efforts to bring peace to Ukraine, US department of state spokesperson Ned Price said at a news briefing on Monday. China has provided Russia with “diplomatic support, political support, with economic support, with rhetorical support,” he added. Russia has given a lukewarm response to a Chinese peace plan to end the war in Ukraine but said it was paying “a great deal of attention” to the detail. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said any initiatives that might bring peace closer were worthy of attention and Beijing’s voice should be heard, but the nuances of the proposal are important and, for now, he didn’t see any signs suggesting a peaceful resolution could be achieved. “Any attempt to formulate theses for reaching a peaceful settlement of the problem is welcome, but, of course, the nuances are important,” Peskov told the Izvestia daily. Russia will not resume participation in the Start nuclear arms reduction treaty with the US until Washington listens to Moscow’s position, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in remarks published on Tuesday. Russian president Vladimir Putin last week announced Russia’s decision to suspend participation in the latest Start treaty, after accusing the west of being directly involved in attempts to strike its strategic airbases. Peskov told the daily Izvestia in an interview that the “attitude of the collective west”, led by the US needs to change towards Moscow. “The security of one country cannot be ensured at the expense of the security of another,” Peskov said. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, is due to visit Beijing on Tuesday for a meeting with China’s president Xi Jinping, in a high-profile trip symbolising the widening gulf between the US and China over the war in Ukraine. Xi’s meeting with Lukashenko, a close ally of Putin, is seen internationally as a sign of where Beijing’s sympathies lie. The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, met with Zelenskiy and other key Ukrainian government officials in a surprise visit to Ukraine to reaffirm Washington’s support for Kyiv on Monday. Following talks with prime minister Denys Shmyhal, Yellen said that the US has provided nearly $50bn in security, economic and humanitarian assistance, and announced another multibillion-dollar package to boost the country’s economy. Poland has announced a joint initiative with the European Commission to trace Ukrainian children who have been abducted and taken to Russia during the ongoing war in Ukraine. The aim of the scheme is to track down the missing children and to “ensure those responsible are brought to justice”, Poland’s EU affairs minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sęk said. “We need to return the abducted children to Ukraine and punish Russia for its crimes,” Shmyhal said."

                    "headline": "Pressure on west to act grows after report on Iranian uranium enrichment",
                    "bodyText": "Iran has enriched uranium particles up to just short of weapons grade, placing further pressure on western powers to issue a third censure of Iran at a meeting of the nuclear watchdog board next week. In its quarterly report to the governing board of the International Atomic Energy Association, officials also revealed that the restrictions placed on its inspectors meant it would take a considerable time to provide a full inventory or history of Iran’s enrichment process. Iran has said the uranium particles, enriched to up to 83.7% purity, had occurred during the “transition period at the time of commissioning the process of [60%] product (November 2022) or while replacing the feed cylinder”. But the IAEA’s faith in Iran’s reassurances in the absence of corroborative evidence is at an all-time low, and will only encourage Israel to encourage the west to endorse a military assault on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Speaking in Berlin, Israel’s visiting foreign minister, Eli Cohen, claimed there were only two options to deal with Iran: using a so-called “snapback” mechanism to reinstate wider UN sanctions on Iran; and “to have a credible military option on the table as well”. But at the weekend, Bill Burns, the CIA director, continued to insist US intelligence did not have evidence that Iran had taken a weaponisation decision. The latest IAEA report to the board speaks about “particles”, suggesting it does not believe that Iran as a matter of policy is yet building a stockpile of uranium enriched above 60% – the level it has been enriching at from some time. The report finds the stockpile of uranium enriched at 60%, for which there is no known civilian nuclear use, has risen since the last report to the board. It estimated Iran’s total enriched uranium stockpile was 3,760.8kg (8,291lbs) as of 12 February. The limit set in the 2015 nuclear deal was set at 202.8kg of uranium, but that limit has been breached for many years by Iran. On Monday in Geneva, Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, insisted Tehran was willing to revive the nuclear deal, but the country’s leadership is riven about the wisdom of doing so. The US has said the revival of the talks is not its current focus. The west is under intense pressure to break off the talks, and instead to proscribe the Revolutionary Guardsin response to the suppression of Iranian street protests. In practice, the west has said it will not revive the deal until Iran explains to the IAEA’s satisfaction about the origins of nuclear particles found at three old but undeclared sites. Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general, is unlikely to go to Tehran unless he knows he is going to be given a fuller explanation than on his previous visits. Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal limited Tehran’s uranium enrichment to 3.67% – enough to fuel a nuclear power plant. The US unilateral withdrawal from the accord under Donald Trump’s presidency in 2018 set in motion a series of attacks and escalations by Tehran over its program."

                    "headline": "Confusion surrounds China’s energy policies as GDP and climate goals clash",
                    "bodyText": "China’s energy policies are fast creating a type of “emissions ambiguity”, as the twin goals of boosting GDP growth and reducing carbon emissions come into conflict. The uncertainty is whether and when the world’s biggest carbon emitter will start to curb greenhouse gas pollution. The release of the country’s annual statistics communique on Tuesday did not clear things up. As Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, noted this month, China’s carbon emissions may have risen 1% or fallen by that amount in 2022. A crude conversion of the 3% GDP growth reported by China and its 0.8% reduction in the carbon intensity of economic activity – as stated in the communique – indicates emissions may have risen 2.2% last year. The calculations matter as China emits more than a quarter of global emissions, roughly twice as much as the next largest, the US. In November 2021, China told the UN it would reach carbon neutrality “before 2060”, and President Xi Jinping has also promised to reduce coal consumption by the 2026-30 period, but has not said when China will stop building new power plants. Pollution growth should also have been subdued in 2022, a year when economic activity was slowed by rolling Covid curbs. Excluding 2020, which included the worst of the pandemic disruptions, GDP growth last year was the weakest since the 1970s. Local officials often use big infrastructure projects, such as power plants, to boost economic activity in their areas. There will be even more pressure to stimulate growth after the GDP target for 2023 is announced at the National People’s Congress, which starts on 5 March. The national target is expected to be about 5%. As Myllyvirta’s centre reported on Monday, China was busy granting permits for an average of two power plants a week in 2022, or six times more capacity than the rest of the world combined. One executive boasted of securing approval to build a 4,000-megawatt coal-fired plant in just 63 days after taking ownership of the project. “China has not seen such a wave of new permits for new coal-fired power plants since the permitting frenzy of 2015, when provincial governments were given the authority to approve new projects,” the report says. Should a large proportion of the 106GW of new coal projects permitted – more than four times 2021’s 23GW tally – begin operation, global efforts to keep climate heating to the Paris accord temperature limit of 1.5C are, frankly, cooked. “One of the clear upshots is that China is now very significantly behind its energy and carbon intensity targets for 2025”, Myllyvirta said. But here is where the ambiguity lies. Permitting does not equate to construction, and since many of the proposed plants are in regions already oversupplied with power, it is not clear new capacity will necessarily equate to extra coal combustion. And, as Myllyvirta highlights, numbers in the communique stating that coal consumption rose 4.3% in 2022 and total energy use rising 2.9% “appear to contradict weak or falling industrial output”. The 3.1% drop in oil consumption and a 1.2% fall in gas use – the first fall in at least 20 years – also point to suspiciously weak demand in the economy. Of course, while China is pouring money into building new coal plants, it is also leading spending on renewable energy and low-carbon products such as electric vehicles – even if the US Inflation Reduction Act looks to challenge that primacy. The IRA pledges, among other things, to result in 950m new solar panels and 120,000 new wind turbines in the US by 2030. China added a record 125GW solar and wind capacity in 2022, with about two-thirds of that solar, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air says. According to the official communique, clean energy consumption – which includes nuclear and hydropower – rose 0.4 percentage points last year to 25.9%. That’s still less than half coal’s share at 56.2%. China’s output of solar panels totalled 340m kilowatts of capacity, up almost half on 2021’s level. Production of so-called new energy vehicles, most of which were plug-in electric, soared 90.5% to just exceed 7m units, the communique says. Why those solar panels and zero-emissions cars might come in handy was hinted at in another statistic that China’s policymakers must keep in mind when considering the urgency of tackling pollution. “Of the monitored 339 cities at prefecture level and above, 62.8% reached the air quality standard and 37.2% failed,” the communique says. Clearing that up, too, would be a good thing."

                    "bodyText": "Jim Chalmers thinks Australian voters will cop big things done slowly and little things done quickly, but not big things done quickly or little things done slowly. This is the treasurer’s theory of governing. Chalmers made a serious attempt last year to tweak the stage-three tax cuts. The treasurer’s first significant budget repair foray was authorised, but then curtailed, by a prime minister who didn’t want to get bogged down in a public slanging match with Peter Dutton about broken election promises only a few months into a new term. Albanese’s verdict on stage three, round one, was too much, too fast. The treasurer’s second major foray into structural budget repair, launched just over a week ago, focused on the fiscal viability of tax breaks on superannuation. Chalmers knew he would shortly be releasing a new statement quantifying the massive costs to the budget of various tax concessions, so he moved along in 24-hour increments, amid cacophonous contention, bumping towards the landing point he and Albanese outlined on Tuesday. Before we hit the landing point, let’s be very clear. The new tax expenditure statement makes a compelling case for a treasurer to get out the axe and start swinging. The latest assessment from Treasury says the concessional tax treatment of superannuation now costs the federal budget about $50bn a year. About 40% of the benefits of tax breaks on super goes to the top 10% of income earners. This revenue-sapping largesse doesn’t stop with super. The cost of 10 of the biggest tax breaks (think negative gearing, capital gains, franking credits and the rest) is now about $150bn a year. Let those numbers roll around your head for a minute or two. The evidence validates action. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But on Tuesday, rather than unleashing the fiscal equivalent of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre to help pay for nuclear submarines and all the services Australians say they want, Albanese and Chalmers announced, in substantive terms, a cautious hop forward. From July 2025, superannuation on balances above $3m would be taxed at a rate of 30%, up from the current concessional rate of 15%. Let’s loop back now to where we started – with Chalmers and his theory of governing. What we saw on Tuesday was Labor closing in on fiscally unsustainable tax concessions. By definition, this is a Big Thing. So, the movement was slow. Think of Tuesday as a proof of concept exercise. If the government can telegraph a direction of policy travel and the world doesn’t end, then maybe further advances are possible. Bit by bit. Budget by budget. Albanese and Chalmers have opted for their new super tax arrangements to take effect from the middle of 2025. They could have started from budget night. Delaying the implementation isn’t about policy, it’s about politics. The delay gives the government an alibi against inevitable accusations of broken election promises. Albanese gave voters the impression before the last federal election Labor wouldn’t be doing anything significant to super. Given this signal is tricky to unpick, the prime minister and treasurer opted to push out the timeframe for implementing their policy shift until after the next federal election. As Albanese told journalists on Tuesday: “We’re putting forward this proposal today as something that we will legislate for, this term, but something that won’t kick in until after the next election. There’s a very conscious decision, so that it’s very clear that everyone can see what we’re doing here, which is about consistent with the commitments that we’ve made.” Just in case we were all too thick to grasp this new strategy, the prime minister circled back to it. “There will be no changes, no changes, this term,” Albanese said. “Even this change, what we are doing is pointing towards 2025. Now, we can’t be clearer, not just in our words, but in our actions. That’s what counts. We’re being very clear here by our actions, what we intend to do.” So the implementation timing speaks to caution; the need for political boilerplate. But the most interesting thing about Tuesday was the extent to which Albanese and Chalmers gave themselves room to move. The prime minister and treasurer copped the predictable rule-in rule-out game. Would they care to rule out pursuing more tweaks or surgery on super taxes or other generous concessions in future budgets? Albanese and Chalmers edged around all the trap doors. Nothing was ruled out. Albanese insisted there would be no changes “this term” – but that was already obvious given Tuesday’s change had a start date of July 2025. Chalmers noted at another point the government’s “focus” was superannuation, and super was “the best place to direct our efforts”. This is indicative, but a measurable distance short of definitive. Coalition frontbenchers stormed the barricades shortly afterwards, declaring in great triumph that Australians needed to lock up their tax lurks, because Labor had ruled nothing out. Liberal frontbencher Jane Hume, during an interview with Sky News, declared somewhat rashly Labor was back in the business of “class welfare”. Whether Labor is back in the business of class welfare remains to be seen. But on Tuesday, the government climbed carefully on to the starter’s block."

Here’s a recap of the day’s news: The Albanese government will raise the tax rate on superannuation accounts with balances over $3m. The federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, released the latest tax expenditures and insights statement, which showed super concessions cost $50bn a year. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, says Labor’s super changes breach an election commitment. Stuart Robert said the Coalition should “double down” on robodebt after he was told it was unlawful, the royal commission has heard. Dozens of cough medicines have been recalled by the TGA. Workplace ministers around the country have been asked to fast-track a ban on silica products. And Safe Work Australia will investigate silica dangers. Australia’s education ministers will develop a framework on AI use in schools. The “exhausted” northern NSW city of Lismore marks a year since traumatic floods. Premier Daniel Andrews has ruled out pill testing in Victoria. Energy provider Ausgrid has started installing electricity pole-mounted EV chargers in Sydney. A man armed with a knife has been shot dead at a Sydney police station. A primary school child was reportedly hit by a train in Adelaide. A man has been arrested over an alleged $5m bushfire extortion attempt. Thank you so much for spending part of your day with us – we will be back tomorrow morning to do it all again. Ruby Rose speaks out on LGBTQ+ discrimination and exclusion at school formals The queer advocate Ruby Rose will join a new partnership between Hilton and Minus18 as an ambassador to raise awareness of the discrimination and exclusion LGBTQ+ teens experience at school formals. Announced in Sydney on Tuesday, the partnership will expand access to LGBTQ+ young people to free and inclusive school formals in new cities and regional areas. Rose says: As a queer person who came out at a very young age, I cannot overstate the importance of this cause ... to drive awareness around the need to provide more inclusive spaces for LGBTQIA+ teens. We must never underestimate the impact inclusion and acceptance has on both young people in their formative years. Attending a school formal as your true self is a rite of passage that every teen deserves. Queer high schoolers too often don’t have the right support network when navigating who they are. It’s time to change this. Since 2010, more than 5,000 young Australians have attended Minus18 events including its Queer Formals. Education ministers agree to consultation on draft national early childhood education policy A consultation approach was also agreed upon at the latest meeting of education ministers on Monday for a draft national early childhood education and care vision, focused on children’s education and development outcomes and parents’ workforce participation. It will be presented to national cabinet in the middle of the year. The federal minister for early childhood education, Dr Anne Aly, presented the principles guiding the development of a preschool outcomes measure for trial, and a national methodology to measure enrolment and attendance, which were endorsed by education ministers. Terms of reference were also accepted for a review to inform the next National School Reform Agreement (NSRA) between the commonwealth and states and territories. The review will be released in the coming weeks, and is due to take effect in 2025. A report released by the Productivity Commission at the end of January found there had been little improvement in educational outcomes since the NSRA was established, with targets “too incomplete and vague” to drive reforms. Also on the agenda was teacher workforce shortages, including the implementation of the national teacher workforce action plan and the feasibility of teaching programs to be reduced to 12 months without reducing quality and standards. Following the release of the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics report on schools, which showed a rise in drop-outs, ministers commissioned the Australian Education Research Organisation to investigate the causes of declining attendance and provide advice on improvements. The rate of year 7 and 8 students in public schools staying in school full-time through to year 12 was 76% in 2022, down from 83.1% in 2018. Education ministers have agreed to develop a framework to guide schools in harnessing and using artificial technology tools in teaching and learning. At the latest communique meeting held by the education minister, Jason Clare, on Monday, the minister and his counterparts discussed opportunities from AI technologies following the viral rise of ChatGPT. A number of states and territories including Victoria, Queensland and NSW moved to ban the use of ChatGPT amongst students in public schools prior to term one due to the threat of plagiarism. A task force, including AI experts, will be established to develop the framework and return to ministers this year. In January, Guardian Australia reported concerns from an academic that schools were “flying blind” on the use of artificial technology in classrooms. Pocock backs super changes The independent senator David Pocock has backed the government over its proposed super tax changes on balances of $3m or more, which he described as a “really sensible move”. Pocock told ABC Melbourne: At a time when the budget is so tight I welcome discussion of winding back tax concessions for people who have accumulated millions of dollars of superannuation. Millions of dollars of superannuation is so out of reach for the average Australian. These are the kind of sensible things that we should be doing when we face the sort of budget we face and most Australians are dealing with a huge cost of living ... These sorts of tax breaks are only benefiting a very small percentage of Australians. Asked if the government should go further, Pocock said: It seems like there are a whole bunch of things that are taboo to talk about. Something like this is fair. Pocock proposed capping the number of investment properties eligible for negative gearing tax concessions at one or two. Fifty-five cough medicine products are being urgently recalled by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) due to a potentially life-threatening ingredient that can cause anaphylactic reactions. The TGA is aware of 50 suspected cases, including one death, where the ingredient has caused patients to go into shock after being mixed with general anaesthesia. The cancellation and recall actions are being taken because of a link between pholcodine-containing medicines and an increased risk of anaphylactic reactions to certain medicines used as muscle relaxants during general anaesthesia. The TGA chief, John Skerritt, says: It is difficult to reliably predict who may be at risk of anaphylaxis during anaesthesia and some patients may not know if they have taken pholcodine medicines recently. Some patients undergoing emergency surgery may not be in a position to talk to their anaesthetist at all. In addition, while surgical facilities may ask about which prescription medicines a patient is taking, they may not ask about over-the-counter products. Fortunately, safer alternatives to treat a dry cough are available and consumers should ask their doctor or pharmacist for advice. I urge consumers to check if any of your over-the-counter cold and flu medicines contain pholcodine and, if they do, ask your doctor or pharmacist to suggest an alternative treatment. Pholcodine has been used in a wide range of over-the-counter pharmacy medicines to treat non-productive (dry) cough, particularly in syrups and lozenges. It is also used in combination with other medicines in products that treat the symptoms of cold and flu. I will bring you more soon. It’s time to shut down greyhound racing for good, NSW Greens say Greyhound racing would end within a year and all dogs would be rehomed and rehabilitated under a New South Wales Greens plan unveiled on Tuesday. The policy includes a transition package to reskill affected workers for other jobs. The Greens spokesperson Abigail Boyd says: Six years on from greyhound racing coming within a whisker of being shut down for extraordinary and well-documented animal abuses this cruel gambling-fuelled industry is again breaking records, with injuries and deaths higher than ever. The industry was given its second chance, and it has thoroughly failed to reform. It’s time to shut down greyhound racing for good. Last week Guardian Australia revealed the number of greyhounds injured or dying on racetracks around the state had surged, with a report from the state’s industry regulator finding that last winter was the worst on record for the sport since 2018. The independent MP for Curtin, Kate Chaney, has come out in support of super changes: 99.5% of Australians will not be affected by today’s announcement. I agree that superannuation is for retirement and ordinary Australians don’t need to be subsidising tax concessions to this extent for people who have more than $3m in their super account. I don’t see it as being a substantial change. It’s more like closing a loophole – superannuation has been used by some for tax avoidance, rather than to prepare for a dignified retirement. I haven’t seen the detail of the amendment yet, but it seems to be a sensible and sustainable measure, consistent with the expectations of most Australians that super is for retirement. Closing this loophole is only a small change. I would like to see a broader long-term review of our tax system, to ensure that we can fairly meet the needs of our changing demographics over the coming decades. Independents react to proposed superannuation changes The independent MPs Zoe Daniel and Kate Chaney have both released statements reacting to the government’s proposed super changes. Here is Daniel’s statement: If the treasurer is correct, his proposal would affect just one half of one per cent of all Australians. Those who are older than 63 who want to remove their money from super and reinvest it elsewhere before the changes flow through will be able to do so. It appears that those who have already invested their money under existing rules, and will not turn 63 before 2025-26, will be the primary group to absorb the proposed tax increase. Daniel said she was seeking information from the Australian Taxation Office about how many people in Goldstein this would impact and would consult her community. That said, while some members of the Goldstein community have large superannuation balances, most have much more modest super accounts. Others are struggling with the various economic pressures that could be offset with the revenue that these changes offer. This remains a consideration for me as I seek to understand this plan. Daniel said she was interested in how the government plans to spend that revenue, including the potential to add superannuation entitlements to paid parental leave. As the treasurer points out revenue foregone from superannuation tax concessions is costing the budget no less than $50bn a year and is projected to exceed the cost of the pension by 2050. This is, therefore, a discussion worth having, however we should be having it as part of a broader review of our tax system. Chemical plant fire prompts evacuation order for Sydney’s Banksmeadow An evacuation order has been issued for Banksmeadow in Sydney after a large fire started at a plastics plant this morning: Jacqui Lambie Network open to superannuation changes And the Jacqui Lambie Network has flagged it is open to the super changes: Senator Tammy Tyrrell says: I think it’s great that the government is looking at these changes, and I’m open to them. But there’s nothing on paper yet. You wouldn’t buy a car without test driving it, would you? I’ll wait until I see what the actual bill looks like before making up my mind. WA premier says police will pursue any breaches of law over Disrupt Burrup Hub campaign Western Australia premier, Mark McGowan, has warned that police will continue to round up, arrest and charge protesters who break the law in the ongoing campaign against Woodside over the fossil fuel giant’s activities on the Burrup peninsula in the north of the state. On Monday night the Fremantle home of Trent Rojahn, lead singer of the Perth punk band Last Quokka, was raided and the musician taken into custody. He was charged with criminal damage over a 13 February incident where he allegedly spray painted Woodside’s corporate headquarters in yellow paint from a fire extinguisher. Rojahn’s alleged actions were part of an ongoing Disrupt Burrup Hub campaign, which is calling on the Western Australian government to put a stop to Woodside’s gas and fertiliser operations on the Burrup peninsula, know as Murujuga to the traditional custodians. The area is home to as many as one million ancient rock art carvings, thought to be as old as 50,000 years. McGowan told ABC Perth radio: If you break the law and you commit acts of vandalism, the police are going to pursue it – and I don’t object to that. The premier said Woodside had been operating in the Pilbara region for more than 50 years. They’re subject to very stringent environmental conditions…[Woodside] provides gas to the city that keeps our lights on, our hospitals functioning and puts gas into your stove. That’s the nature of our society. Rojahn has been bailed to appear in court on March 27. It was the second night raid in a week related to Woodside protests, with six counter-terrorism officers descending on the Perth home of ceramic artists Joana Partyka on 24 February. Partyka had already been sentenced and ordered to pay $7,500 in fines and costs after pleading guilty to a 19 January incident, where she stencilled a yellow Woodside logo over the Frederick McCubbin masterpiece Down on His Luck at the Art Gallery of WA. Burke vows not to repeat the mistake of failing to act on asbestos The live feed of the Burke presser had only one question before we cut away – which is about the CFMEU banning engineered stone from July 2024, no matter what the federal government does. Burke: Unions and organisations will make whatever decisions they make within the law. It will also be the case that some suppliers will start to look now at how they can get lower levels of silica in the bench tops or how they can look for other alternatives in people’s kitchens and bathrooms. So a whole lot of adjustments will happen straight away. What we’ve done today is the job of governments. I wish governments had started this process sooner. Of course I wish when the now prime minister and myself were making speeches in the parliament about this when we were in opposition, of course we wish this process had begun then. The decision we made today though we weren’t going to wait for the official start date of getting things moving to next year. As I said, Australia took 70 years from the time we were warned about asbestos to the try that we got to the point of a ban. We’re not going to make that mistake again. Burke said not all engineered stone is 97-98% silica, there are some forms that have a much lower level – so Fair Work would look at what risk level was safe. And then to also scope out how you can have a nationally consistent licensing system for whatever remains as being viewed as safe to be on the market. That licensing system would have to apply to legacy products. We need to remember now even for the most dangerous of these products, they will now be in kitchens where as long as they’re left alone, they’ll be quite safe. But what happens when that homeowner decides it’s time to renovate? What happens if there’s a demolition of the house? Burke says the legacy issue we had with asbestos will be the same for stone bench tops. No one should be worried in terms of what they currently have in their home and think suddenly that’s a dangerous item to have but the moment it’s adjusted, the moment it’s moved, the risk is real and we do not currently have the rules in place to make sure that it’s safe. We initially went to the meeting on the basis that we would try to meet again in six months’ time. We ended up resolving if the report is ready earlier than that we will meet earlier than that. We will scope out the different things that can be done at each level of government. Burke: Silicosis is a disease that hits people regardless of age. Here in this building when I was in opposition a couple of years ago I met a young woman by the name of Joanna who was 35 at the time. She told me her greatest fear was not seeing her daughters grow into adulthood. She explained she was in a workplace with high levels of silica dust and working as an administrative assistant and now has a terminal illness. Burke said the states and territories have asked Safe Work to investigate the dangers and scope out the regulation that is needed for people to work with these products: I’m pleased to say we have ended up with a unanimous decision across every state, territory and commonwealth. We have now tasked Safe Work Australia to do the work to scope out what regulation is required for all workplaces where you deal with silica dust and to also scope out specifically with respect to engineered stone and engineered stone bench tops to do the work starting now on what a ban would look like. Hello everyone – Tony Burke is talking about silicosis: There’s been a big conversation about the dangers of silica in the workplace and what that means for silicosis and other lung diseases. It’s for that reason that I asked all state and territory ministers to meet together today to work through how can we move together to provide that simplest of protections to make sure that when somebody goes to work, they’re not contracting a terminal illness simply by attending their job. Silicosis does not only, is not only relevant to kitchen bench tops. A huge percentage of the earth’s crust is silica. And some people will say silica is a natural product, it’s naturally occurring. So is asbestos. There are products when they’re in high levels of concentration create unacceptable levels of risk. There’s been an understandable focus therefore on kitchen bench tops, even though that’s not the whole story with respect to risk of silica. Kitchen bench tops can be in the order of 97%, 98% silica. It’s all happening on the blog this afternoon! I am handing over to Cait Kelly who’s going to take you straight to the employment relations minister Tony Burke speaking in Canberra. Taylor says there are details on super changes the government needs to provide: Now there’s a great deal of detail that hasn’t been laid out about what’s been proposed today. We don’t know how to find how benefits will be treated under this and how undivisible assets will be treated, unlisted assets, how they’re going to be liquid assets and be treated under what’s proposed by Labor. Taylor ends on the familiar note of criticising Labor’s spending: It’s clear this has been rushed but what is also clear is that when the Labor party runs out of money, it comes after yours. And we’re going to see, I’m confident, a lot more of this from the Labor party. They’re not talking about managing their spending and managing their budget. They’re talking about raising taxes. Australians will pay for a Labor party that adds over $114bn at the last budget in October. A Labor party that has committed an extra $45bn of off budget spending that will have to be paid for by Australians. This is the Labor party that wants to spend your money and is going to have to tax all Australians in order to be able to do that. Taylor seems worried the government could change its mind on stage-three tax cuts next: We also know from the treasurer that he is keen to get rid of the stage-three tax cuts. Tax cuts that are crucial to prevent inflation, raising the average tax for a large proportion of Australians. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, is speaking in Sydney responding to the government’s changes on super announced today. He’s continuing Hume’s theme they represent a breach of trust of what was said before the election: The prime minister has walked away to his commitment to the $275 reduction in electricity prices. We’ve seen the prime minister walk away from cheaper mortgages that he committed before the last election. And today we’ve seen the prime minister and the treasurer walking away from their commitment to not add taxes to superannuation. Now this was an unambiguous commitment from the prime minister. He said he wouldn’t raise taxes on Australian super. Australian super is Australians’ money. That must be the starting point here. It is clear Labor is prepared to break a promise to charge more tax. The prime minister and the treasurer released a report laying out more than $150bn of additional taxes that they may well choose to impose on the Australian people. They refused to rule out imposing capital gains tax on Australians’ homes. They refuse to rule out getting rid of negative gearing. And we know they’re coming after franking credits. Indeed, they’ve introduced broad-ranging legislation to come after franking credits into the Parliament already. This is the Labor party that says one thing before an election and does something very different afterwards. Leon also sought advice on her own legal position. She told the inquiry: Discussions that were being had with other ministerial offices and conveyed to me suggested that some ministers wanted to see whether we could stop the process, but not repay the debts. Stop the process but not tell anyone. Stop the process and only repay if people appealed. There were a lot of suggestions going around that seemed to be inconsistent with my obligations to do the right thing and the lawful thing. She went on: I ended up having to stop the program in advance of a decision by the government to do so. Leon also corroborated a top departmental lawyer’s claim that the then attorney general, Christian Porter, had told Robert words to the effect of, “It’s right, mate”, in relation to the solicitor general’s advice. Leon said: And really it was only from that point that minister Robert and the government as a whole felt they did in fact have to abide by the solicitor general’s opinion, because the first law officer had confirmed it. Robert announced on 18 November 2019 the robodebt scheme would be “refined”, but did not apologise and claimed only a “small cohort” of people were affected. Guardian Australia revealed in March 2020 the government had privately accepted it would need to refund hundreds of thousands of victims. It announced the decision on a Friday afternoon in May 2020. Robert is set to appear at the royal commission on Thursday. The inquiry, before Catherine Holmes AC SC, continues. Leon was asked about another meeting with Robert on about 7-8 November 2019, again before the program had been shut down but after the solicitor general had determined it was unlawful. Leon said she told Robert the best option was to apologise, admit the error, and “inform customers and staff of the steps we will take to correct the error”. Leon claims Robert responded: We will absolutely not be doing that. We will double down. He said it confidently and firmly. I have a very strong memory of it because I was so surprised and shocked … I thought my advice was obvious … It seemed the only thing for an organisation that had been found to be doing something unlawful was to cease doing it and to remediate and to apologise. Leon said after that conversation a brief was prepared for Robert to set out that “one couldn’t just dismiss” the solicitor general’s advice. The former government services minister Stuart Robert told the boss of his department the Coalition would not apologise and would “double down” after he was informed the robodebt scheme was unlawful, the royal commission has been told. Renee Leon, a former human services secretary, told the commission Robert had also expressed doubts about the importance of the solicitor general’s September 2019 finding that the program was unlawful. Corroborating evidence from another public service witness, Leon produced a handwritten note of a conversation from 29 October 2019, when she briefed Robert on the solicitor general’s opinion. Leon said Robert had treated the conversation “appropriately seriously”, but the minister had responded to her briefing by saying: “Legal advice is just advice.” Leon said: I remember it because it was so shocking to me, I suppose. Because we weren’t talking about some low level advice, it was the solicitor general. Leon also told the royal commission that, although the decision to stop the scheme was one for the government, she ended up halting the program herself before any decision was made. She did so after receiving advice from her chief lawyer warning of her obligations, including the risks of misfeasance in public office from continuing to oversee an unlawful program. Robert is set to appear at the royal commission on Thursday. Jane Hume criticises Labor ‘breach of trust’ on super The shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, has accused Labor of “doubling” the tax on super of 80,000 Australians, a “breach of trust, a breach of a pledge made before the election”. Hume told Sky News that despite saying the legislation was not retrospective, the changes have “not been grandfathered” so will apply to: people who sold a family business and reinvested i super; older Australians who downsized a large family home; people who made additional contributions to super. Hume said that the tax expenditure statement also referred to negative gearing and capital gains tax, questioning if changes to those will arguably “not be a breach of trust if they legislate this term but implement them in the next term”. Former Labor leader, Bill Shorten, was at least up front about wanting to cut tax concessions, she argued. Hume also fumed that the measure was an “attack on class welfare” - perhaps a slip on the more common phrase “class warfare”. Greens yet to finalise stance on superannuation changes Asked about whether the Greens are saying a blanket “no” to supporting the government’s proposed changes to super, Bandt says the Greens are yet to reach a final position: The Greens will have a discussion about the government’s proposal when we meet in Parliament and have a chance to consider the government’s proposal in full. Obviously they have only announced it today. So I can’t give you the Greens’ final position on the legislation today. The point that we’re making is that even if this goes ahead and gets this modest change to superannuation tax concessions for the very wealthy goes ahead, the very same people are going to find themselves on the receiving end of a $9,000-a-year cheque from Labor with tax cuts for politicians and millionaires that are frankly unaffordable. Our main concern is that any savings from this - even this modest measure won’t find their way into the pockets of everyday people who are struggling with rampant inflation and the cost of living crisis, but instead could just be used to fund the stage-three tax cuts for the very same people. The Greens leader Adam Bandt has just held a press conference responding to the government’s announcement on superannuation changes. Bandt is critical that winding back super tax cuts won’t make a difference to Australians facing cost of living pressures: Let’s look at reigning in the stage-three tax cuts for the politicians and billionaires, scrapping them and using that money to instead make everyday people’s lives better with cost of living measures like freezing power bills and getting dental into medicare. That’s the kind of change that will make a difference to people, not winding back super tax cuts on one hand only to give the very same people a $9,000-a-year tax cut. More on Leeser’s speech to the Uphold and Recognise conference today: Albanese has continually pointed to the 270-page Calma-Langton report, completed under the former Coalition government, when asked for detail about the voice. But the government has not formally adopted any of the report’s numerous suggestions for how the voice would work, or said it would do what the report outlined. Leeser said: I say to the minister and the prime minister, tell us which ones you have picked. Build the case. Engage in an act of persuasion. Answering the questions is about providing Australians with the roadmap of what this body will look like. It should provide confidence. Leeser put the potential failure of the referendum back on the PM himself, saying it would go down without better engagement with the public. The prime minister has argued ‘what would the neighbours think if this goes down’, my response is what would we think of ourselves having rushed to failure and insulted the first sons and daughters of our land? But I want to be clear, if a referendum question is put and fails, it wouldn’t just be the prime minister’s failure. After all, he set the timetable and the process. It would be a failure of all those who did not urge caution and proper process. We must get this right because the prospect of failure is unthinkable. Leeser calls on government to formally respond to Calma Langton Report Opposition shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Julian Leeser, claims the Labor government is “mucking it up” on the voice to parliament, calling on Anthony Albanese to issue more detail on the proposal to win support. Leeser, also the shadow attorney general and a supporter of the voice, has called on the Labor government to issue a formal response to the Calma Langton co-design report, saying people deserve to know what the Indigenous consultation body would do. He said today: The lack of a process and the lack of detail is hurting the idea of a voice. Good process and more detail will get this referendum back on track and it has to get back on track because it’s not tracking to success. Leeser, among the opposition’s staunchest supporters of constitutional recognition for First Nations people, gave a speech to the Uphold and Recognise conference today - a gathering of constitutional conservatives who back the voice in principle. After fellow Liberal Andrew Bragg gave a speech saying the referendum was “dead” without more conservative support, Leeser accused the government of “mucking it up and changing course again and again.” Leeser said: Australians have a right to know how that institution will work. I believe the way to provide the detail is for the government to formally respond to the Calma Langton Report. ACT calls for ban on gambling ads The ACT government has called for significantly tougher restrictions and potentially a complete ban on gambling advertisements, arguing companies are targeting the social insecurities of young men. ACT attorney general and minister for gaming, Shane Rattenbury, has told a parliamentary inquiry into gambling harm that Australians “are fed up with having kids particularly bombarded with online gambling advertisements”. Here’s what Rattenbury told the inquiry: We would like to see far greater restrictions, if not an outright ban on a range of gambling advertisements, particularly during hours where younger people are watching but across the board. This advertising is particularly targeted at young men. Due to a range of studies, we know that young men are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of gambling. The industry is targeting young men by putting things together like “bet with mates”, which essentially says if you want to be cool and you want to be socially accepted with a good group of friends, then you should get a betting account together. I think this is particularly insidious and I think there’s a role for the government to step in and say this is unduly harmful and unduly targeted at members of our community. Rattenbury told the inquiry that future generations would question why the scale of gambling and associated advertising was able to reach this point before regulation. NSW premier promises no more privatisation of assets The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has declared he will not sell off any more of the state’s assets and conceded the government will go deeper into debt to pay for infrastructure in the next term of parliament. Speaking in western Sydney, the premier ruled out introducing new taxes and said the state’s debt position would be “sustainable and manageable” while it increased to pay for the state’s ballooning infrastructure construction. He said: We are not privatising assets. The premier has previously said his government did not have “any plans” to sell off more assets but on Tuesday went further. The NSW opposition has already ruled out further privatisations and has been critical of the government’s record. Perrottet agreed his government would go deeper into debt to pay for its infrastructure pipeline, explaining it was part of getting back to surplus. He said: We have an incredibly manageable and sustainable debt position here in NSW. We always deal with our debt position as we move through the budget process. When it comes to getting the budget back in the black, as the treasurer knows, that’s the first starting point of surpluses is you start to invest in infrastructure. We have a pathway back to surplus. Police investigating alleged stabbing at Reservoir high school in Melbourne Victoria Police said: Officers responded to reports of a stabbing at a school on Plenty Road about 10.50am. A boy was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. A boy was arrested and is currently assisting police with their enquiries. The exact circumstances surrounding the incident are yet to be determined. There is no ongoing threat to the community. Anyone who witnessed the incident or has information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential report online at www.crimestoppersvic.com.au Robodebt inquiry told DHS secretary took ‘credit’ for scheme The former secretary of the Department of Human Services, Renee Leon, has told a royal commission her predecessor Kathryn Campbell took “credit” for the robodebt scheme. Appearing at the inquiry on Tuesday, Leon, who replaced Campbell in October 2017 and held the role until December 2019, said her relationship with her predecessor was initially collegial but became “difficult” as time went on. Leon said when she took on the position at DHS in October 2017, she was aware of deep cultural problems at senior levels at the department. She said she was told officials sometimes yelled at each other, publicly shamed one another, and there was concern about raising bad news. She said: You end up with a situation where people are afraid to raise risks or say something negative because they might get humiliated or yelled at. Leon said she tried to make clear “no one would get shot” for bringing her bad news, adding, “It’s much better to find out, than to find out afterwards, as I discovered.” Leon said she had been “shocked” to read the solicitor-general’s advice in the middle of 2019 that found the robodebt scheme was unlawful. In 30 years as a public servant, I have never discovered that I’d been administering a program of the scale that was unlawful. Campbell has told the commission she was involved in an early brief for the robodebt proposal in 2015, but did not see the plan through the budget process. She has said she regretted not seeking external legal advice but added the scheme’s legality was primarily the Department of Social Services’ responsibility, because it managed social security law. Leon was asked about her understanding of where the robodebt proposal had come from. She told the commission: It was spoken of and understood to have been the concept of the Department of Human Services… Kathryn did tend to credit for it, though that could just be because secretaries tend to take credit for the work of their department. But I understood it to be something she thought of. And in my early dealings with her, in the first six months of the role, I remember talking to her about the need for [budget savings]. She had recommended to me I should look further in the compliance area, because that was where there was money to be found, and she had had great success in doing that by coming up with the online compliance interventions and associated data-matching ideas. Campbell is expected to give evidence again at the commission. The inquiry continues. Andrews says he won’t comment directly on child sexual abuse case Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, says his thoughts are with victims of child sexual abuse following the sentencing of former Collingwood cheer squad identity Jeffrey “Joffa” Corfe. On Monday, Corfe was handed a 12-month prison term, wholly suspended for two years, meaning he will avoid prison. Corfe pleaded guilty to a charge of sexually penetrating a child under the age of 16. If he did not plead guilty, the judge would have handed him a prison sentence of two years and four months with a non-parole period of 14 months. With the suspended sentence, he will be a registered sex offender for 15 years. If he commits a crime in those two years, he could be re-sentenced to serve out the whole 12 months in prison. Asked if the state’s attorney general will urge prosecutors to appeal the sentence, Andrews said: I’ve had a number of people reach out to me on that judgement and we understand how confronting that is. We understand how triggering and how deeply distressing that is. I don’t want to comment on individual judgments that’s not appropriate but the OPP [office of public prosecutors] regularly reviews these sorts of issues, [and] has all manner of different options available to them. But I’ll let the attorney general and the OPP deal with that. That should be away from a press conference. But I do understand and I do appreciate that yesterday was a very challenging day for victims survivors of child sexual abuse. - with AAP The press conference with the PM and treasurer has wrapped up and I have a few bulletins from my colleagues to catch you up on, including circling back to Dan Andrews’ press conference. Albanese is asked about his trip to India in a week’s time, and whether he will be raising with his counterpart Narendra Modi his role in the 2002 Gujurat riots. Reporter: A recently revealed report by the UK government found [Modi] was directly responsible for a climate of impunity during the Gujurat riots which killed more than 800. Human Rights Watch is warning of a rise of mob violence in India. Can you guarantee Australians, particularly the Muslim diaspora here, that this is something you’ll raise with him when you meet with him? Albanese doesn’t directly engage with the substance of the question about the riots and human rights in India: I look forward to the visit. I’m going at the invitation of prime minister Modi. I’ll be taking some of you along, I think, although Kieran just got put with the luggage! I’ll be talking as well the CEOs of some major Australian companies. Can I say this about the relationship with India: The Varghese report which I think one of the best documents about Australia’s relationship with the rising power that has ever been written. And it’s a pity that a whole lot of it has just stayed on the shelf. What I’m determined to do is to build a better relationship between Australia and India. I see it as a relationship of opportunity. I look forward to having positive discussions with the Prime Minister. One of the things that my government has done also is to return to acting like a diplomatic government should. We’ll continue to act in that vein to develop positive relationships, we always stand up for our values and I’m very much looking forward to the visit to India along with the CEOs of major Australian corporations. This is a very significant visit and later on in the - possibly in the first half of this year as well, I’ll welcome prime minister Modi, prime minister Kishida [of Japan], and president Biden to Australia for the Quad leaders’ meeting. That will be a very significant event to be held here in Australia as well. Australia’s back around the international table engaging with our neighbours, pursuing our interests, but also pursuing our values. That’s a positive thing. We took you straight to the breaking news of the prime minister’s announcements about superannuation, but just taking you back a moment to the beginning of his speech. This is what Albanese had to say in a tribute to the communities of southern Queensland and the northern rivers of New South Wales on the one year anniversary of the disastrous floods: One year on, our thoughts are with the loved ones who lost their lives during and as a result of these floods, as well as the thousands of people who were dislocated from their homes and from their businesses, communities like Lismore, were doing it really, really tough and continue to do so. Our thoughts are also with the volunteers. The Australian Defence Force personnel. All those who have come in and provided support and assistance on the ground, that I have witnessed firsthand In northern New South Wales and in Queensland. Since then, tragically, of course, we have also seen major flooding in southern and western New South Wales, in Victoria, in Tasmania, in the riverland in South Australia and of course around Fitzroy Crossing and the north-west of Western Australia. This is a difficult country. But at the worst of times we see the best of the Australian character. And over the last year we have seen that. So, my thoughts are with those who today it will be a very difficult day. We’ll continue to provide support to state governments, to local government, to individuals, over $3bn has been committed to recovery from the February last year, New South Wales floods, from state and the federal government. We’ll continue to roll out resilience and betterment projects as well as in disaster-prone regions, including to our new disaster ready fund. We need to make sure we don’t just build back to what was there, but build back better, so that communities are greater protected. And I thank all those today for whom two will be a tough day. Paul Karp follows Murph: You said the 99.5% will see what you’re doing today but I don’t think they heard you categorically say you’re not going to do other changes to superannuation. Do you want to take an opportunity to do that and say - say that’s not part of your plan, you’re not going to do that even on the other side of the next election? Albanese: There will be no changes, no changes, this term, even this change. What we are doing is pointing towards - is pointing towards 2025. Now, we can’t be clearer, not just in our words, but in our actions. That’s what counts. We’re being very clear here by our actions what we intend to do. As always, Murph gets to the heart of the matter: Just picking up on the structure point, forgive me I’m a bit confused as to where the boundaries of action are. You have released a document today that basically categorises a bunch of tax concessions that are unaffordable across the board that punch an enormous hole in the budget and you - you basically worked out a situation where you have identified one reform that you want to make that you will put to the people before it takes effect. So are you seriously saying that that’s it - you’re not going to do any more on any other concession that has been identified in the document today between now and the election? Why is that? Because the top 10 tax concessions show $150bn in foregone revenue. With so many pressures on the budget, and so many barriers to tax reform, is this it? A tiny slice of what amounts to $50bn in tax concessions that will only come into effect after the next election? Anthony Albanese: The tax expenditure statement isn’t a policy document. It’s an action of transparency. It’s important that people be able to see exactly what the system is, where the ins are, where the outs are, revenues and expenditures and it’s about transparency. That’s why it’s been done today so people can see that. So, no other movement there, but the expenditure is laid out clearly. Will that start a grown up conversation? Let’s see. Taking questions, Albanese wants to emphasise this is his government taking a long-term view: This is about long-term sustainability and the structural problems that are there. One of the things I often get in media conferences, why do politicians always just focus on the short term? Where’s the long-term thinking? My government is focused on short term issues – we’re focused on dealing with the floods, all of that - but we’re very much focused as well on the long-term challenges that Australia faces. That’s why we’re making this decision. Anticipating the Coalition’s criticisms, Chalmers warns the opposition will have to explain to the Australian people why they’re “prepared to go to war for the one half of 1% of people.” Now, one final thing about our opponents. This is the same - these are the same people who gave us a trillion dollars of debt and deficits as far as the eye can see, they now want to borrow even more and have even bigger deficits in order to give the most generous tax breaks to people with tens of millions of dollars in super. In 2016, they jacked up taxes on superannuation to the tune of $5bn. At the time, Angus Taylor said it’s inappropriate that someone who contributed millions and millions of dollars continues to get the 15% concessions. That’s what Angus Taylor said in 2016 when they increased taxes on super. If they want to vote against this change and try and prevent this change, they can explain to people why they’re not prepared to back energy bill relief for pensioners, they’re not prepared to back people fleeing domestic violence with more affordable homes, and a broader and deeper industrial base in this country, manufacturing jobs, but they’re prepared to go to war for the one half of 1% of people with more than $3m of superannuation in their accounts. They can explain that to the Australian people. We take our responsibilities seriously. This is about responsible economic management. We think we have struck the right balance here and we’re confident we have. Chalmers says while he knows this is a contentious area, he’s confident Australians are going to understand this is a fair change: I’m confident that Australians will see this change as modest and reasonable and fair. But one which makes a difference to the sustainability and affordability of the superannuation system that we cherish. I think it’s good that more people have become aware over the course of the last week or so, about some of the features of the tax concessions in superannuation, I know this is and can be a contentious area. But equally, we take our responsibility to manage the budget in a common sense way, very, very seriously. We are interested in the right path here, and not just the path of least resistance. So who are we talking here? What are the numbers? Anthony Albanese: People can see what we’re doing here. Which is we’re proposing a change that will have the impact on 0.5% of the population. And Mark [Riley, reporter], if you knew there was someone out there who had $400 million in their superannuation account, I didn’t, if you knew there was 17 people who had $100 million in their account, I didn’t, and it’s hard to argue that those levels is about actual retirement incomes. Which is what superannuation is for. Chalmers clarifies some of those numbers around super and who this will affect: The average superannuation balance is about $150,000. And the few people with balances above $3 million hold an average of almost $6 million in their accounts. As the prime minister said, 17 people have got more than $100m, one person has got more than $400m. $100m fund earning a 5% return receives a tax break upwards of $1.5 million a year, compared to a return outside of super if it was taxed at the marginal rate. It takes 100 average wake earners paying the average amount of tax to pay the tax break for that simple super account every year. 100 ordinary people to fund with their taxes the tax break on someone with $100m in super. Every dollar spent on a tax break with tens of millions of dollars in super is a borrowed dollar that makes the deficit bigger. There will still be tax concessions for you, they just won’t be quite as generous as they were before. Treasurer Jim Chalmers is being VERY careful in his language in announcing these changes. We are talking about changes to the tax concessions for 0.5% of people with superannuation accounts. In 2025-26. So the policy won’t even kick in until after the election, and will be part of a future mandate the Labor government would be seeking. So nothing changes now, and maybe something will change in a couple of years for those 0.5% of super holders, who have more than $3m in their retirement accounts. For context, the average super account holds $150,000 (mine isn’t there yet). So this is not even something that most people would even have to worry about. But because so much of budget talk when it comes to tax reform is a toxic cesspit, here we are. Dancing around about making changes for about 80,000 people – who will still get tax concessions, but maybe not as much. And who have more than $3m in their super accounts. Here is Chalmers explaining the tax expenditure statement: It’s important to understand what the tax expenditure statement is not. It is not a statement of government policies or even policy intent, it shouldn’t be read that way. It’s an honest reporting of the facts, what the various concessions are, who benefits from them, and how much they cost the budget. We tried to be up-front in the our time in office about the challenges in our economy and in our budget. And I think people are pretty familiar with them by now. We inherited $1 trillion of debt that is getting more and more expensive to service as interest rates go up. We have persistent and growing spending pressures in health, defence, aged care. In the near term in the budget we’re doing pretty well from a combination of higher commodity prices, lower unemployment, and the beginnings of stronger wages growth. But beyond the next couple of years the budget pressures are intensifying rather than easing. This is the mess that we were left and this is the mess we’re trying to clean up. And the announcement the Prime Minister has just made is part of that effort. Now, in the past week or so, there’s been a welcome debate about the sustainability of some of the more generous tax concessions in our superannuation system. And what the tax expenditure statement shows is that the cost in revenue foregone from super tax breaks is about $50 billion a year. And that will surpass the cost of the aged pension as I said before, by around 2050. This debate or this part of the debate began when we released the proposed objective of superannuation, but making sure its purpose is to deliver a dignified retirement for working people. That’s what super is for. Only 17 people have over $100m in their super accounts, says Albanese Albanese goes on to explain the rationale behind the decision, including $2bn in savings to the government’s bottom line when it is operating on a full-year period. Labor built the superannuation system and we have fought to keep it strong. But Australians who are having to make tough decisions around the kitchen table expect their government to be prepared to make tough decisions around the cabinet table. And with 17 people earning over $100 million - having over $100 million in their superannuation accounts – the individual who has over $400 million in his or her account, most Australians would agree that is not what is superannuation was for. It’s for people’s retirement incomes. Confronted with this information, it will be irresponsible to not take any action whatsoever. That’s why we’ve made this decision today. This reform will strengthen the system by making it more sustainable. The savings that are made from the reduction in these tax breaks will contribute $900m to the bottom line over the forward estimates. And some $2 billion when it is operating on a full-year period. PM confirms timing of super reforms is ‘intentional’ for post the 2025 federal election Good afternoon from Canberra – where, after a week of discussion, the government has announced where it is going on super. And, as flagged by Paul, Murph and I over the last couple of days, the government will cap tax concessions for people with more than $3m in their superannuation account. So instead of a 15% tax concession, it will move to 30%. Here is how Jim Chalmers explains it in his press release: From 2025-26, the concessional tax rate applied to future earnings for balances above $3m will be 30%. This is expected to apply to around 80,000 people and they will continue to benefit from more generous tax breaks on earnings from the $3m below the threshold. This adjustment does not impose a limit on the size of superannuation account balances in the accumulation phase. And it applies to future earnings – it is not retrospective. This modest adjustment to tax breaks for the biggest accounts is expected to generate revenue of about $2b in its first full year of revenue after the election. The 2022-23 Tax Expenditures and Insights Statement released today shows that the revenue foregone from superannuation tax concessions amounts to about $50b a year. The cost of these concessions is projected to exceed the cost of the Age Pension by 2050. You might notice it is not coming in until 2025-26. That is AFTER the next election. Anthony Albanese says that is intentional: It’s after the next election. It’s also not retrospective. It applies to future earnings. Labor built the superannuation system and we have fought to keep it strong. But Australians who are having to make tough decisions around the kitchen table expect their government to be prepared to make tough decisions around the cabinet table. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is now speaking in Canberra about the changes just announced to superannuation. After acknowledging the anniversary of the Northern Rivers floods, Albanese says: The cabinet has met this morning and had a discussion about superannuation. You may have noticed it’s been occurring over recent times. This Government inherited a trillion dollars of debt with very little to show for it. Today I’m announcing that the earnings on super balances above $3 million will be a concessional rate of 30% rather than 15%. This proposal does not change the fundamentals of our superannuation system. 99.5% of people with superannuation are unaffected by this reform. Under 80,000 will be impacted by this. Importantly, this change will not occur until 1 July, 2025. You will have noticed that’s beyond this term. It’s after the next election. It’s also not retrospective. It applies to future earnings. From 2025-26, the concessional tax rate applied to future earnings for balances above $3m will be 30%. The change is expected to apply to around 80,000 people, which is 0.5% of the Australian population. The 15% rate continues for balances under $3m. Queensland education union calls for urgent action following damning report on health and wellbeing in sector A union representing more than 17,000 principals, teachers and staff across Queensland and the Northern Territory has called for urgent action to address the health and wellbeing of students and staff following a damning report into the sector. The Independent Education Union QNT branch secretary Terry Burke said the summary findings of the latest Australian Principal Occupational Health, Safety and Wellbeing Survey reinforced the extent of the sector’s workload crisis. The survey found the number of principals looking to retire had tripled in the last three years, broadly due to workload and a lack of time to focus on core duties. Burke: We see this in the burnout of our teachers and other school staff and the increasing rates of school refusal by students. We don’t have a teacher shortage - we have a shortage of teachers willing to work under oppressive workloads. Like teachers, our school leaders are forced to do too much work unrelated to their core duties, severely impacting their health and wellbeing. Both government and school employers need to take urgent action on the issue of workload and work intensification in our schools by putting in place meaningful reforms to tackle the paperwork, red tape and obsession with data which are sucking the life out of our profession. Victoria will not follow Queensland in rolling out pill testing, the state’s premier, Daniel Andrews, says. Speaking to reporters at Box Hill Secondary School, in Melbourne’s east, he claimed the service created a false sense of security for drug users: I don’t think that we will be putting in place a pill testing regime because I don’t think that you can take these drugs at any level and be safe. Pill testing can often give people the sense that it is safe to take these drugs. And it isn’t. The pharmacology, the evidence, is very, very clear. The Queensland government on Saturday announced it would introduce pill testing at mobile and fixed sites following the trials in Canberra. The service would allow users to have their illicit drugs chemically tested for the presence of potentially dangerous substances and chemical compounds. Retails sales rebound, trade surplus swells – will this mean 10 out of 10 RBA interest rate rises come next Tuesday? Data out from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) points to the resilience of the economy. First up, retail sales rose 1.9% in January, reversing part of December’s 4% retreat. (CBA had tipped January’s sales to rise 2.1%.) Department stores did particularly well, with turnover up 8.8% for the month, when seasonally adjusted. On the trade front, Australia garnered a $14.1bn current account surplus in the December quarter up from a revised $753m surplus in the September quarter. (Initially, this was reported as a deficit.) The trade surplus reached $40.9bn, the second highest on record, the ABS said, with higher commodity prices helping. The net primary income deficit fell to $26.4bn following the record-high deficit of $30.4bn in the September quarter. Economists believe the fatter current account surplus will add 1.1 percentage points to the December quarter’s GDP growth (and make up for the 0.8ppt subtraction from the change in inventories, we saw yesterday). We’ll get those GDP figures tomorrow. Both the retail sales and trade numbers will be seen as positives for an economy absorbing a record series of interest rate rises. Prior to today’s ABS figures, investors were lifting their expectations for how high the Reserve Bank will lift its key interest rate. They are now looking at the equivalent of four more 25 basis-point increases to come. The first of those will almost certainly come next Tuesday. If so, that would be 10 rises in 10 RBA meetings. Liberal moderate Andrew Bragg calls for draft of voice to be released, warning it is ‘dead’ unless ‘no’ camp is convinced to change Liberal senator Andrew Bragg warned the voice to parliament referendum is “dead” without a major increase in conservative support, claiming supporters were focusing on “convincing Australians who are already voting ‘yes’.” “This will not be effective,” the NSW senator warned in a speech today. Bringing all Australians to the table on the Voice is now urgent. Bragg, a Liberal moderate and one of the opposition’s staunchest supporters of constitutional recognition for First Nations people, will give a speech to the Uphold &amp; Recognise conference today - a gathering of constitutional conservatives who back the voice in principle. He said that winning the backing of liberals and conservatives for the referendum “will be challenging but essential”, pointing out recent polling showing only 13% of Liberal voters supported the change. The reality is, that the government needs to take liberal and conservative voters with them to succeed at this referendum. If only 13% of Coalition voters vote yes, the voice is dead. In reality, at least 25% of Coalition voters will be required to vote yes if the voice is going to get up. Bragg has called for a parliamentary inquiry into the referendum so that politicians can probe the proposed constitutional amendment and question. He repeated those calls in his speech, suggesting an exposure draft of the voice bill be released pre-referendum, but also suggesting a change in the overall campaign itself. At the moment, a lot of the campaigning seems focused on convincing Australians who are already voting ‘yes’... We need to convince Australians who are on the fence or planning to vote ‘no’. Bragg claimed this needed to include precise information about what the government “wants to achieve with a new power ... We need to know exactly what is being proposed by the government of the day”. I am concerned too few Australians can see how this new power will be deployed to help communities close the gap. My view is that an exposure draft of the Bill or at least a detailed policy should be published by the government. This must set out how the voice will improve lives and help close the gap in communities. Harvey Norman posts fall in interim earnings and dividend as consumer spending slows Leading retailer Harvey Norman appears to be seeing the signs of slower consumer spending, but remains confident of withstanding any economic headwinds. The company today reported a fall in interim profit, but said the result represented solid growth that was above pre-pandemic levels. First-half net profit totalled $369.8m – down from $433.7m in the previous corresponding period – on total revenue of about $2bn, including $1.5bn of sales of products to customers. After stripping out foreign currency items, and land, building and other asset revaluations, the attributable profit for the six months ended December was $390.2m, down from $461.4m. Harvey Norman said in a statement: Despite the macroeconomic headwinds and cost of living pressures affecting discretionary retail, our strong balance sheet and our substantial growth in net assets throughout the pandemic has left us in a solid position to withstand these challenging circumstances. We remain confident in our brands and the strong market position held by our Australian franchisees and overseas company-owned stores. Brands include Harvey Norman, Domayne and Joyce Mayne. Harvey Norman declared an interim dividend of 13 cents per share, down from 20 cents in the same period in the previous financial year. - AAP The Guardian is turning 10!

Immediate 3% pay rise offered to Curtin University staff after emphatic ‘no’ vote to previous offer by management Curtin University staff have been offered an immediate 3% pay rise after overwhelmingly voting “no” to management’s latest enterprise agreement proposal. On Monday afternoon, it was revealed 72% of staff voted “no” to management’s offer, which offered staff 2.2% annual pay increases over the next five years. NTEU Curtin branch president professor, Scott Fitzgerald, said staff had sent an “emphatic message” to management. The NTEU is keen to strike a fair agreement as soon as possible. Now we need management to work constructively with us on our reasonable claims around issues such as pay, job security and workloads. Given the overwhelming size of the No vote, Curtin management have finally responded to our calls for an administrative pay increase for all staff to help with the cost-of-living crisis while negotiations continue. Let’s not forget people who work at Curtin are the only staff in WA public universities who haven’t received a pay rise since July 2021. Dylan Botica, president at the Curtin Student Guild, said it was pleased staff had sought to secure a “fairer offer”. Workers at Curtin already do not have sufficient resources to provide feedback, answer student concerns and improve the student experience. We are pleased that they rejected a bad offer that would have made student learning conditions worse. ‘This is a lone actor event’, Smith confirms That police press conference has wrapped up but here are some finals details. Smith described the attacks as happening without any time for the officers to engage in negotiation: Both incidents themselves had seconds. There is just not an impending time. It is immediate. He launches through the glass doors at the officers. They had very little time to react. They’re trained to call out warnings in relation to it and that will be a matter for critical incident. I can assure you the cleaner had no idea of the attack and certainly the officers were caught upon fairly quickly and responded quickly as well. Smith says he wants to “reassure the public this is a lone actor event. We are not looking at [anything] further in relation to it”. Smith says the officers involved and the 28-year-old cleaner will receive “extensive counselling”. Smith says the cleaner is in a stable condition. Smith confirms man ‘launched at and tried to attack the two police’ A reporter asks police for more detail about what triggered a response from officers: The initial press release said the man threatened police. But when you’re explaining it now, it seems he’s just standing outside the doors in what way was he threatening? Smith confirms that the man attacked the two police: I think maybe a better description of it - he launched at and tried to attack the two police. You know, thank God, obviously, training and their response quickly, you know, averted an officer also being significantly injured in this matter. It was an attack at the railway station. It was a further significant attack at the police station. The nexus between the two is a matter for the critical incident team to discover. Obviously, that will include, you know, notifying the coroner and we have oversight who were there last night. Previous interdictions related to checking Covid status of alleged attacker Smith says the possibility that the alleged attacker had a history of mental illness is a line of inquiry being pursued by the investigating team but that none of the five police interdictions with the individual are related to mental health. Those interdictions were only related to police checking on his status while he was ill with Covid. Smith: There are only five interventions or five interdictions with this individual, none criminal and none relating to mental health or anything else. Reporter: So it wasn’t a breach of Covid rules? It’s that they had Covid and were checked on to maintain lockdown status that right? Smith: The south-west was subject of significant lockdown. Police obviously knocked on doors through that period. Those five are benign. They are benign to this investigation other than to establish that reference in the cops’ database. Smith questioned about involvement of counter-terrorism unit Smith is asked to provide detail on why the counter-terrorism unit was involved and says it is part of the response when someone arms themself with a knife: It’s part of our model in terms of response. Obviously, when someone arms themselves with a knife, stabs an individual and then tries to attack - which the CCTV footage is highly concerning. It would have been a stressful situation for the officers. They had no alternative but to respond. When that’s involved, it triggers a number of intelligence responses and investigative responses which we’re dealing with as we speak. Alleged attacker identified as 32-year-old Auburn resident who arrived on student visa in 2019 Asked about the identity of the alleged attacker, Smith says he arrived on a student visa in 2019: What we know about this 32-year-old man: He arrived in Australia on a student’s visa from India in 2019. He remains in that processor visa. We are reaching out, or investigators from the critical incident led by homicide, are reaching out to the Indian consulate so we can confirm his identity. That process is expected to be delayed. … He resides in the Auburn area. Some supplementary inquiries by the critical incident team - we locked down Auburn police station, Auburn railway station and a third residential area subject of a crime scene warrant which is being processed as we speak. We are leaving no stone unturned in establishing the intent of this individual. Police investigation over Auburn shooting involved counter-terrorism intelligence Smith: A critical incident investigation has been established. It will be led by homicide. There is significant response to this. It includes a large contingent of investigators from south-west region and includes some counter-terrorism staff, real-time intelligence centre, assisted by terrorism intelligence unit, have worked through the night to build a profile. We can say the man had five interactions with police, none of them criminal, during the Covid period. Police are speaking in western Sydney about what occurred in the fatal overnight shooting in Auburn. They say a stabbing incident at the Auburn railway station preceded the altercation with police. New South Wales Police assistant Commissioner Stuart Smith says: A male person from Auburn, 32 years of age, entered the turnstiles of Auburn railway station. It was at this time he launched a frenzied attack on a 28-year-old cleaner working at the facility. As a result of that stabbing he received a puncture wound to his left forearm and fell to the ground. The attack was not discontinued. It continued with a further frenzied slash and the 28-year-old victim has further suffered a puncture wound to the hip region. Leaving that individual there, what we now know is around four minutes later, this same male, this same 32-year-old Auburn man arrived and was in the vicinity of the outside glass doors which separate the council building from the Auburn police station. He was hyperventilating and he appeared to be looking towards the police station. Very soon after, a 000 call came over the air for responding police to attend the stabbing incident at Auburn railway station and two police officers moved from the police station through a set of glass doors and attempted to exit the building through the glass doors. At that stage, the 32-year-old male then went to attack the officers, who both retreated inside the police station. The senior male officer then withdrew his Glock service pistol and fired three shots. Two of those shots connected with the chest area of the 32-year-old man, whilst a probationary constable, a female, in his near proximity, withdrew the taser to cover the suspect. The male fell to the ground, he continued thrashing and he was subdued. He was treated by first aid. He was rushed to Westmead Hospital where life, unfortunately, was announced extinct at 1.32am. Australia bans Liberian-flagged container ship for 90 days A Liberian-flagged container ship has been banned from Australian ports for 90 days due to the operator’s dangerous maintenance practices. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority yesterday issued a refusal of access direction notice to the MSC Kymea II because of months of substandard performance from the ship’s operator, MSC Shipmanagement Ltd (MSC). In a statement, AMSA said it has detained nine MSC ships over the past two years, including five ships in 2023 alone, many of which showed systemic substandard maintenance practices onboard. The statement went on to give details of what defects the authority has found: The AMSA inspection of the MSC Kymea II found 21 deficiencies in total, including a defective free fall lifeboat steering system, defective fire safety systems, dangerously-stored flammable materials, and multiple wasted or missing railing safety chains used to prevent stevedores from falling from heights when lashing cargo. Another MSC vessel inspected two weeks ago was found with a corroded fuel-oil tank air pipe, and the evidence suggests that the ship attempted to hide the seriousness of the defect from authorities by covering up the rusted pipe with canvas and painting over it. AMSA executive director of operations Michael Drake said the agency’s inspection regime has shown that MSC has failed to meet its obligations to properly maintain its vessels. AMSA has zero-tolerance for sub-standard ships operating in Australian waters and we will not hesitate to ban vessels that fail to meet basic safety standards. The Australian public has an expectation that ships operating in Australian waters meet or exceed the minimum international standards for safety and environmental protection. Ships should be on notice that this kind of repeated poor performance is not acceptable, and Australia will take action. Billion-dollar loss for EnergyAustralia underscores grid’s fragility We know the electricity grid has its woes. These include last June’s market suspension for about a week and last week’s warning from the operator about potential “reliability gaps” in coming years without “urgent” investment in renewables. EnergyAustralia, one of Australia’s big three generator/retailers, has provided additional details on those strains after it reported a full-year loss of about $1bn for 2022 (via its Hong Kong-listed parent CLP). Those losses came in part because of unplanned outages of its ageing Yallourn brown coal-fired power plant in Victoria. In NSW, its Mt Piper black coal-fired power plant also couldn’t get all the coal it had contracted from Centennial Coal, forcing it to buy more costly spot market coal. (We covered some of those issues at Mt Piper in this feature.) Anyway, as for what’s coming, EnergyAustralia said it would bring forward “major outages” at the 1480MW Yallourn where it will try to patch up two of its four units in 2023 and do the same for the other two next year. (The market operator will be watching that 740MW outage and how it might affect supplies.) The company said: This will provide the opportunity to address in a targeted way the main causes of forced outages in 2022. For Mt Piper, the company has renegotiated the coal supply deal to include a second mine, Airly, to support Springvale “thereby partially reducing supply risk”, it said. Separately, EnergyAustralia said it had pleaded guilty in December to three charges under the Victorian Occupational Health and Safety Act relating to the 2018 death of Graeme Edwards, an operator at Yallourn. “EnergyAustralia again expressed its profound regret and remorse for the tragic and avoidable death of Mr Edwards and acknowledged the impact it has had on his family and his workmates,” it said, adding that sentencing in Victoria’s County Court earlier this month resulted in a $1.5m penalty for the company. Watt says he takes Lismore promises ‘very personally’ Watt said the government “absolutely” intends on keeping the promises made to stand by the communities devastated by last year’s floods. He says it’s an issue he takes “very personally” having heard from the individuals who went through near-death experiences. I would ask people to look at what we’ve done since coming to office. Keeping the commitments that we’ve made, whether it is to flood victims or anyone else, has been a core part of the way that the Albanese government has operated. And I take it very personally, having spent so much time in Lismore, to make sure that we do follow through to people. I remember … You know, I’ve met people in the days after the floods, who thought that they were going to die, who were trapped in the cavities of their homes or being rescued [by] helicopters and the tinny army. I don’t want to let those people down and our government doesn’t want to let those people down and we’ll stand with the communities as long as it takes to get them back in shape. ‘All Australians are thinking of the survivors’ on anniversary of floods, Watt says The emergency management minister, Murray Watt, has told ABC News Breakfast he has “mixed feelings” on the one year anniversary of the Northern Rivers floods: I’ve been back to Lismore seven or eight times since the floods, and I’ll be heading back there this evening for the memorial service. On the one hand, every time you go there, you do see progress. You see shops reopening. You see big institutions like Norco, a big employer in the region, starting to rebuild. You do see people moving back into their homes. But of course, at the same time, you recognise how much more there is to be done. This was a massive event, and I always remember the Lismore mayor telling me the first time I met him, was that this wasn’t just a flood - this was a disaster. That’s the kind of scale of things that we’re dealing with. And I just want to say that I think that all Australians are thinking of the survivors, the emergency personnel, the ADF and all the community members who helped out a year ago through those terrible events. Eight coal projects to be considered by NSW forecast to add 1.5bn tonnes to global emissions Eight coal projects the New South Wales government will consider in 2023 would add at least 1.5bn tonnes to global greenhouse gas emissions if they all proceeded, according to analysis by Lock the Gate. The anti-mining group said it was the largest proposed expansion of coalmining in the state since the Paris agreement on climate change was signed and showed a need for changes to planning laws to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis considered eight proposed expansions of existing mines that could be assessed and determined in NSW in 2023. Models still tilting towards drier conditions for most of Australia Later today, the Bureau of Meteorology will provide its fortnightly update of the main near-term climate drivers for Australia. (Global heating being the main background mover, of course.) As we reported at the start of January, it’s been clear for a while that the “three-peat” La Niña was subsiding with the prospect of an El Niño taking its place. The latest climate models used by the Bureau continue to point that way: As climatologists will underscore, autumn provides an annual predictability hurdle so we can’t be sure yet that we’ll get an El Niño forming in the Pacific. Meanwhile, the Indian Ocean typically works in tandem with the Pacific, and the models too are leaning towards a positive phase of the ocean’s “dipole” (which compares relative warmth of sea surface temperatures in the west and east of the basin). Again, we’ll need a month or two yet to be certain but both the Pacific and Indian oceans are setting up for drier conditions particularly for eastern Australia. That might provide some solace for those in northern NSW and south-eastern Queensland who are marking the first anniversary of the huge floods. However, those remembering the Black Summer fires of 2019-20 might not be so cheered by the prospect of increased risk of heatwaves, drought and bushfire if the current model projections hold up. There are reports a primary school child has survived being hit by a train in Adelaide’s north this morning. Police and paramedics were called to Tambelin railway station after a person was struck by a train just before 8.15am this morning. According to the Adelaide Advertiser, it was a child, who the paper understands is conscious and breathing. Police confirmed the crash occurred at Evanston Gardens involving a pedestrian and a train. Education minister heading to India with higher education delegation The education minister, Jason Clare, has revealed the delegation of higher education representatives accompanying him to India this week, where he will sign a sweeping mutual recognition agreement between the two nations. Clare: This will be the broadest and most favourable recognition agreement India has signed with another country and will enhance student mobility between both countries. The Modi government’s National Education Policy has a target to get 50% of young Indians into higher education and vocational education by 2035. That’s nation-changing for India, and a genuine opportunity for Australian education providers to do more to collaborate with India. The visit provides an important opportunity for Australian universities to showcase new partnerships and plans which they can deliver in India, including opportunities for joint degrees and campuses. Among Clare’s delegation will be vice-chancellors and leaders from the University of Queensland, RMIT, Australian National University, the University of Sydney, La Trobe, the University of Wollongong, Western Sydney University, Central Queensland University, the University of NSW, the University of South Australia and Charles Darwin University. University of Wollongong’s Global Brand Ambassador and former Australian cricketer Adam Gilchrist will also join the delegation. Wendy’s v Wendy’s US burger chain Wendy’s is making moves to roll out in Australia, but it won’t come without a fight from Australian brand Wendy’s Milk Bar, recognisable for its pink banner often found in shopping malls. The US chain will hope to avoid the fate of Burger King, where the US chain was made to rebrand to Hungry Jack’s in Australia due to an existing Burger King franchise in the country. My colleague Jordyn Beazley brings you the full story: PM pays tribute to Northern Rivers flood disaster anniversary The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has paid tribute to those who lost their lives in the Northern Rivers flood disaster on the one year anniversary since residents woke up to “streets turned into rivers”. A man has been arrested in Melbourne’s north-east following an alleged $5m bushfire extortion attempt. Police allege the 27-year-old man from Bundoora sent an online message to a Queensland emergency service last year demanding the hefty sum be paid in crypto currency within three days or a bushfire would be lit. Investigators traced the message back to Victoria and last week a search warrant was executed at a Bundoora address, where police seized several items, including two computers and a phone. No money was paid and the threat was never carried out. The man was taken into custody on Monday and charged with extortion with threat to endanger life, threat to destroy/damage property, possessing a drug of dependence, and failing to provide information under a warrant. He is set to appear in Heidelberg magistrates court on 1 August. - AAP The first pole-mounted electric vehicle charger in Sydney has launched as part of a plan by energy provider Ausgrid to install 30,000 stations throughout Australia over the next six years. The charger, installed in the inner-west suburb of Glebe, is the first installed outside Newcastle where the project launched in December last year. Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore, said the facility could help to boost the confidence of apartment dwellers weighing up whether to buy an electric car. Ausgrid chief executive, Marc England, unveiled the Sydney charger on Monday, in conjunction with charging infrastructure firm EVX and the City of Sydney. England said the new facility was designed to be unobtrusive in the urban location and give current and future electric car drivers another option to recharge, particularly those who did not have access to a private garage. Glebe is exactly the kind of suburb where demand for this solution will grow in the coming years, it is densely populated and many people don’t have access to off-street parking. We believe that once the community see more charging infrastructure like this close to their homes, they will feel confident they can make their next vehicle purchase an EV. Mounting the chargers on poles ensured the chargers would not take up “precious road and footpath space,” Moore said. Ausgrid has committed to installing 30,000 pole-mounted electric vehicle chargers around Australia by 2029, with the technology promising to be cheaper to deploy than standalone vehicle-charging stations. - AAP Tony Burke ‘confident’ states will back engineered stone ban report Earlier, the workplace relations minister Tony Burke told Radio National he was confident today’s meeting of work health and safety ministers will agree for Safe Work Australia to start now on a plan to ban engineered stone benchtops. Burke said: At the moment the number of Australians with silicosis keeps rising. This is part of the cause. If you could easily regulate it, you wouldn’t be considering a ban at all. The view I’m putting to ministers today … is that we should be asking Safe Work Australia as of today to be scoping the options for a ban as well ... I have a good degree of confidence about how the meeting will go today. As we’ve had the conversations office to office, it hasn’t been a party political [issue] across which governments, Labor or Liberal. There has been a good degree of support that we shouldn’t be delaying scoping what a ban might look like. Burke said that after Safe Work Australia reports back ministers will have to consider “a few different options” including what percentage of silica in benchtops should trigger a ban. After a decision in the second half of the year, it would take “a good 12 months or more” to phase it in. Lismore mayor reflects on work needed to rebuild a year on from floods Lismore mayor, Steve Krieg, has told ABC News Breakfast that it is “still quite emotional, and very raw 12 months on” from last year’s flood disaster. The fact we have thousands of people living in temporary accommodation, they’re paying mortgages on houses that are unliveable. The businesses they worked in were so badly affected as well. There’s so much strain and stress on people in the northern rivers region. This isn’t Lismore specific, so to speak. Today’s going to be a very hard day for the community. We hope that everyone rallies around each other. And we’ll get through today and look towards the future and rebuilding. Asked about the mixed feelings today, with some wanting to avoid all mention of the anniversary while others feels the need to commemorate, Krieg says: I can’t rewrite history, you can’t change what happened. You need to be objective and say, righto, this is what happened to our beautiful city. But how do we plan for that moving forward? You’ve got to keep the optimism and the hope alive that Lismore will come back and build back better. Asked what he would like if he could have a “wishlist” from the government, Krieg says the federal emergency management minister “Murray [Watt] has been outstanding” but there have still been many roadblocks: Every recommendation coming out of the studies the federal government is funding, the CSIRO study, we need that work to be done. We still have a tractor system to operate our pumps. $30m last week announced to upgrade our pump systems is a good start. But it’s important to remember it’s just the start. We’ve got a long journey ahead of us and we need those promises fully funded so that Lismore can grow and thrive again. Today the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will release the tax expenditures and insights statement, which measures tax concessions, credits, deductions and other expenditures in Australia’s tax system. The key findings of this year’s statement are: Superannuation tax breaks are worth about $50bn a year The 10 biggest tax breaks are worth more than $150bn annually The majority of tax breaks go to high income earners. Chalmers has noted in recent days that fewer than 1% of account holders have more than $3m. Proposals to cap super balances or to limit tax concessions on large balances could be worth a few billion a year. Fresh evacuations in Gisborne as NZ’s big wet continues New Zealand’s saturated summer has one last sting in the tail, with residents in Gisborne facing fresh floods after an overnight deluge. On the last day of a summer that will break records for rainfall, residents of the Gisborne suburb of Mangapapa were ordered to evacuate at 5am. The city received about 60mm of rain in the eight hours to 8am this morning, on top of already saturated land. Gisborne mayor Rehette Stoltz told Radio NZ: The rain woke I’m sure everyone up in Gisborne at 3am, it’s rain like we’ve never heard it before. Residents have reported flooding in around 10 streets already ... it’s pouring. Absolutely pouring. There are reports the Matokitoki Stream has burst its banks, running about two metres higher than usual. Gisborne District Council chief executive Nedine Thatcher Swann said about 15 households had been ordered to evacuate and others had chosen to. Climate agency NIWA said more than 100mm of rain has fallen in parts of northern Hawke’s Bay and Gisborne in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. As at 9am, MetService have heavy rain warnings in place for the Gisborne-Tairawhiti district and the Wairoa region of Hawke’s Bay. The latest rainfall has produced fresh slips and highway closures on the North Island’s east coast, cutting off remote communities such as Tokomaru Bay. Parts of hard-hit Napier were also flooded again overnight from the same weather system, with residents urged to stay off key roads. - AAP On the voice, Dreyfus also confirms that the government’s intention is that the voice be able to provide advice to the executive government. It’s been suggested the wording could be watered down and the executive advice provision removed in order to secure support from the opposition. But Dreyfus confirmed the government still wants to include both: Those are the words that were included in the draft that the prime minister laid out in the historic speech that he gave at Garma on the 30th of July. … I’m convinced that the voice will be effective if, as a constitutional requirement, it is able to make representations to the parliament and to the executive. But I also understand that when we introduce the constitution alteration bill, it will go to a parliamentary committee. There will be public submissions as is appropriate and will come to final wording when the bill is debated in both houses of the Australian parliament, which will be a process finalised probably in June. Government discussing modernising referendums with opposition: Dreyfus Ahead of the referendum on the Indigenous voice to parliament, Dreyfus says there have been cooperative discussions with the Coalition on the need to modernise referendums to make them more like general elections. Those discussions are continuing. And we want there to be as far as possible agreement across the parliament on how the referendum is to be conducted. I think there is already agreement that we need to modernise the really adequate processes that apply to referendums current, most of it comes from an act that passed in 1912. We need to modernise it to make sure that this referendum that’s going to be conducted in the second half of this year looks like as far as possible a general election. And there have been so far cooperative discussions with the opposition. The much more important bill of course, is the constitution alteration bill which is going to follow in late March, and that will contain the words to change the constitution. But the process is on track. And we are, as all of my colleagues, the prime minister [and] Linda Burney [have] kept saying, wanting this to be an inclusive, cooperative process which involves the whole parliament. Mark Dreyfus ‘hopeful of doing more’ to better protect journalists and sources The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, is speaking to ABC Radio following his meeting yesterday with key media figures on how to better protect journalists and their sources. They discussed a range of issues around privacy laws, whistleblower protections, defamation and warrants, such as those that were used to raid the ABC and the home of journalist Annika Smethurst in 2019. I think most Australians agree that journalists should never face the prospect of being charged just for doing their jobs. I think there’s agreement across the parliament across the community about that, and that improved protections are overdue. This is the start of a process. I’ve invited journalists and media organisations to put forward further thoughts. So it’s a start of that conversation yesterday. But I’m hopeful of doing more moving on. Last year, Dreyfus dropped the prosecution of whistleblower Bernard Collaery. RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas asks him whether he will also drop cases for David McBride who has been prosecuted for allegedly leaking top secret defence information to the ABC or Richard Boyle who has allegedly revealed unethical debt recovery practices. Dreyfus says he won’t comment on the cases, which are currently before the court. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, and the opposition leader, Chris Minns, are both expected to attend the memorial in Lismore. Amid criticism for the speed of the home buyback, Perrottet on Monday noted the mammoth task facing authorities and the community. It will be a long journey ahead. It will be a challenge and we will stand with those communities have we had as we have over the last 12 months. Minns said it would be a tough day for residents affected by the floods but all of NSW was committed to continuing the rebuild of the Northern Rivers. Minns said ahead of his visit to Lismore: One year on from the floods that devastated the Northern Rivers, we are reminded of your resilience, your courage, your community spirit. From the tinny army, to the locals who put their own lives in danger to save others, to our emergency services. The first home buyback offers were issued on 21 February, with all 250 offers expected to be issued by April. - AAP With the devastating Lismore floods still imprinted on the NSW city and its 45,000 residents, locals will pause for the Gathering of Reflection and Healing. Five lives were lost and more than 3,000 homes were damaged or destroyed in the Northern Rivers city on 28 February 2022, when a month of record rainfall lifted the Wilsons River to a new high of 14.4 metres. The memorial today will be preceded by a private ceremony to acknowledge the herculean effort of dinghy owners who ferried hundreds of people from rooftops to safety. The event kicks off three weeks of events in the city, including a music festival in the CBD this weekend and a celebrity cricket match on 11 March. About 60% of businesses have returned to the CBD, but the relocation of schools means hundreds of their customers have gone. Ella Buckland, whose house was inundated with 1.5 metres of water, told AAP: Initially everyone was pumped up on adrenaline. And then you had little wins, like the coffee shop coming back and everyone was really excited and supportive and kind, like cuddling people who you didn’t know. Now everyone is just exhausted. - AAP ABS seeks feedback on what questions to ask in 2026 census The government is seeking public feedback on questions that will be in the 2026 census – which new questions should be added, and which old ones should be dropped. Assistant minister for treasury, Andrew Leigh, said the Australian Bureau of Statistics was opening public consultations today on the next census. Following feedback before the last census in 2021 (the census is done every 5 years), the ABS added new questions on long-term health conditions like asthma and diabetes, and about Australian Defence Force participation. But the ABS will also consider questions that could be discontinued, with previous census counts dropping topics like whether people had been married more than once, or about televisions and internet connections in households. Leigh said feedback on census topics can be submitted through the ABS website. Leigh said in a statement today: Omitting less relevant topics makes it easier to add new questions. The Census helps Australians understand how we’re changing as a nation. The public has a vital role to play in shaping the topics to be included in the Census. As Australia’s population changes, so too does the information we need to make the right policy decisions for our future. ‘Really clear’ wages are not driving inflation, Tony Burke says Circling back to the interview with employment relations minister, Tony Burke. He’s asked about soaring corporate profits, which were up more than 10% in the December quarter compared to wages which rose 2.6%, and whether that demonstrates that it’s corporate profits driving inflation – as the union movement is arguing – not wages. Burke replies: It is really clear that wages are not driving inflation, are not the principal driver of inflation here. It’s really clear we don’t have some sort of spiral of inflation being caused by high wage growth. It’s also really clear we don’t have high wage growth. I was pleased that the last wage price increase got up to 3.3%. To the extent that that’s the highest it’s been for some time and had we not taken actions that we took last year, particularly with respect to the minimum wage and awards, you wouldn’t have got to figure as high as but it’s still much, much lower than inflation. So the argument that somehow wages are the problem here is an argument that I think really needs to be put to bed. ‘Maggot-infested’ meals allegedly served to Snowy Hydro workers Hopefully you’ve already eaten your breakfast before you take a look at this story which comes from AAP, or you might just lose your appetite: Workers on the Snowy Hydro 2.0 project are threatening to walk off the job over conditions, saying safety is being compromised and workers have been served maggot-infested food. The Australian Workers’ Union has released photos of steak riddled with maggots allegedly served on the site in the NSW Kosciuszko national park where workers are building a national renewable energy project. AWU NSW secretary, Tony Callinan, said the food being served was indicative of a broader management problem on the site. Callinan said in a statement today: Supermax prisoners are served better food than the workers building Snowy Hydro 2.0. You have workers living, literally locked up in a camp with limited recreational facilities in the middle of nowhere, being fed maggot-infested food. The site has an abysmal safety record. It’s an absolute pressure cooker right now. Many workers were living off canned tuna and two-minute noodles, and were threatening to walk off the job. Callinan alleged: The problem is the joint venture who was awarded the contract is pinching every penny they can to try and improve their profit margin. The union also claims it receives regular reports of serious safety issues on the site. Callinan said: The whole site’s a tragedy waiting to happen. Comment is being sought from Snowy Hydro. Tony Burke confident enough ministers will be on board to fast-track engineered stone ban The minister for workplace relations, Tony Burke, is speaking to ABC Radio ahead of his meeting with other state and territory workplace safety ministers which will consider banning the engineered stone linked to a deadly lung condition. Burke says he doesn’t want to repeat the mistake that was made waiting to ban asbestos: We waited 70 years from when we were told about the dangers of asbestos before we got to a ban. I don’t want us to be making the same mistake this time. Burke says he doesn’t want to let 12 months lapse while Safe Work Australia scopes out what a ban would look like; “I want that work being done straight away,” he says. If 60% of ministers at the meeting are on board, the ministers will fast-track banning the dangerous material. Burke says he’s reasonably confident they will have the numbers to do so: I’ve got a good degree of confidence as to as to how the meeting will go today. But obviously, jurisdictions are free to put whatever view they want. But as we’ve had the conversations office to office, it hasn’t been a party political thing across which governments Labor or Liberal, there has been a good degree of support for the concept that we shouldn’t be waiting any longer before we’re at least scoping out what a ban might look like. Chief of air force pushes for low-cost killer drones My colleague Daniel Hurst has told you what the defence minister, Richard Marles, told the Avalon airshow last night. At the same event, Australia’s chief of air force, Robert Chipman, has flagged Australia needs to urgently acquire large numbers of low-cost killer drones to be able to take on well-armed adversaries. The airshow is one of the country’s biggest defence industry expositions before it opens to the public from Friday. The Australian reports that Chipman told the audience of Australian and international air force heads at yesterday’s symposium ahead of the event that that “fifth-generation” fighters such as the F-35 “will not be enough” to win future conflict: (Drones) don’t replace the roles of contemporary combat aircraft, but they might serve as a useful complement. We are considering the potential of low-cost drones to bring mass to our air combat system. And we’re considering what key measures are necessary to defend against them. The impediments to boosting capability are often policy-related, procedural or cultural … While advanced platforms teamed with cutting-edge and disruptive technologies can be gamechangers, we won’t realise their advantage without evolving our thinking. State and territory workplace health and safety ministers will be asked to fast-track a ban on the domestic use of silica, following its link to a deadly lung condition. An estimated 600,000 workers have been exposed to silica dust generated through mining, construction, building and manufacturing. Kitchen benchtops made from engineered stone are particularly dangerous, with about one in four stonemasons who work with them developing the deadly and incurable disease silicosis. The federal workplace minister, Tony Burke, will put the ban proposal to ministers at a meeting today, with the hope regulations could be drafted by the end of the year. The dust and diseases taskforce recommended governments start considering a ban in July next year. But a report by Safe Work Australia to be presented to the ministers will recommend three actions: an education and awareness campaign, better regulation of silica dust across all industries and further analysis and scoping of a ban on use of engineered stone. If two-thirds of ministers agree, Safe Work Australia will be tasked to begin consultations on a potential ban on engineered stone, including silica content levels and other risk factors. Safe Work will present a report on the potential ban within six months, and draft regulations by the end of the year. As well, Burke is set to announce the federal government will consider an importation ban, after consulting stakeholders. Burke said: If a children’s toy was harming or killing kids we’d take it off the shelves – how many thousands of workers have to die before we do something about silica products? We can’t keep delaying this. It’s time we considered a ban. I’m not willing to wait around the way people did with asbestos. Occupational health experts say the material can’t be worked with safely despite the use of equipment such as masks. - AAP Good morning! Natasha May on deck with you. Thanks to Martin Farrer for kicking things off for us. Workplace health and safety ministers are meeting this afternoon to discuss banning the importation of engineered stone, a material that has been linked to a deadly lung condition known as silicosis in the stonemasons handling it. The federal minister for workplace relations, Tony Burke, says that if two-thirds of ministers agree, Safe Work Australia will be tasked to begin consultations on a potential ban on engineered stone, including silica content levels and other risk factors. In Victoria, the international Avalon airshow kicks off in Geelong today. Chinese and Russian militaries have been excluded from the event where a new Australian-designed lethal drone will be unveiled this morning. In NSW, a memorial will be held commemorating the one year anniversary of devastating floods in the Northern Rivers where five lives were lost and more than 3000 homes were damaged or destroyed. The memorial will be preceded by a private ceremony to acknowledge the tinny army that ferried hundreds of people from rooftops to safety. Let’s get into it. New technology diminishes advantage of Australia’s remote geography: Marles Richard Marles also told the industry event last night that Australia could no longer rely on its remote geography, which had previously been “a huge asset in the defence of our continent”. The defence minister said capability advancements – particularly in the last decade – meant “the advantages of our geography have been diminished”: Today we face a range of threats – including longer-range missiles, hypersonics and cyber-attacks – which render our geographic advantages far less relevant. Marles did not give exact timing on when the Aukus submarine plans would be announced by Australia, the US and the UK, but it is widely expected to be in March. He did, however, give a broad outline on what the “optimal pathway” would entail: This announcement will describe how Australia will evolve our submarine capability from operating our six diesel-electric Collins Class submarines today to the point where Australia is building and operating its own nuclear-powered submarines in the future. We will describe how we intend to invest in Australian industry to make this happen. We will make clear how Australia and our partners will meet our non-proliferation obligations and, in the process, establish the highest bar possible for transfers of this technology. And we will articulate the cost. While describing nuclear-powered submarines as “the single biggest leap in Australian military capability since the war”, Marles also emphasised that the government would remain focused on diplomacy: And while Australia will always do what we must to get the hard power equation right so that we have the capabilities which keep our people safe, I also want everyone to understand that our government knows the frontline of Australia’s engagement with the world is diplomacy. And this will be our abiding focus. For it is through diplomacy that we can create pathways for peace. Marles says Australia will be transparent with Pacific partners amid defence spending boost The defence minister, Richard Marles, has promised that Australia will be upfront with its partners across the region to ensure there are “no surprises” amid an increase in defence spending and the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines. The Morrison government’s original announcement of Aukus in 2021 sparked a diplomatic rift with France and concerns in Indonesia and Malaysia. Marles told a defence and industry dinner in Melbourne last night that China was “driving the largest conventional military buildup we’ve seen anywhere in the world since the second world war and much of this buildup is opaque”. He said that meant it had “never been more important for Australia to employ sober, responsible and clear-eyed statecraft”. Marles said Australia would increase its overall defence spending and grow its military capability “in a way that is both predictable and transparent”. He added: We want to ensure we are consulting our partners in the region, and around the world, so that there is understanding and no surprises. Marles said the Defence Strategic Review – to be released alongside the government’s response to it in April – included a line from former defence chief Angus Houston and former defence minister Stephen Smith that “investing in our Indo-Pacific regional partnerships is essential”. Marles said the Albanese government agreed and wanted “our partners to be confident in the steps we are taking and the level of transparency we intend to maintain – not just at the time of these announcements, but over the years ahead”. He added: I conveyed this commitment to my counterparts in the Philippines and Thailand during my visit last week. I conveyed it to Minister Subianto Prabowo of Indonesia during his recent visit to Australia. A critical incident investigation is under way after police shot dead a man armed with a knife in the early hours of Tuesday morning, New South Wales police said in a statement. About 12.08am, an as-yet-unidentified man attended Auburn police station, in Sydney’s inner west, and threatened officers with a knife before he was shot, the statement said. Officers immediately performed first aid and the man was taken to Westmead hospital but died a short time later. Police believe he was involved in the stabbing of a 28-year-old man at 12.03am at Auburn railway station. Neither man is known to one another. The younger man is at Westmead hospital in a stable condition. A critical incident team composed of officers from state crime command’s homicide squad will now investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident, including the discharge of a police firearm. Good morning and welcome to the rolling news blog. I’ll bring you the top overnight stories before my colleague Natasha May takes over. First up, CSIRO scientists are warning this morning that the spread of superbugs resistant to antibiotics and antifungal treatments threatens a “global health crisis” unless there is greater coordination and better management of patient data. It comes as researchers say that an invasive strep A variant first identified in the UK and thought to be behind a surge in deaths has likely contributed to a similar uptick in serious disease and hospitalisations in Australia. The voice to parliament referendum will be at the top of the political agenda today as leading social justice groups step up a push to win a yes vote in the face of some divided opinions. The Fred Hollows Foundation, Oxfam Australia, the Australian Council of Social Service and First Nations advocacy organisation Antar will lead nearly 150 organisations in the Allies for Uluru Coalition, which will be launched in Melbourne today. The defence minister, Richard Marles, told a dinner in Melbourne last night that China was “driving the largest conventional military buildup we’ve seen anywhere in the world since the second world war and much of this buildup is opaque”. It meant that it had “never been more important for Australia to employ sober, responsible and clear-eyed statecraft”. We’ve got more to come on what Marles said. One of Australia’s biggest trucking companies, Scott’s RL, has gone into administration, putting 1,500 jobs at risk. The company is a refrigeration trucking specialist and is a key contractor for all the major supermarket supply chain, so the insolvency also threatens to disrupt the nation’s food supply chains. We’ll have more on this story soon."

                    "bodyText": "Good morning. Where once there was protocol, now there is protocol amended by framework. I’m talking, of course, about the announcement yesterday that the UK and the EU have agreed a deal to end the interminable dispute over post-Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland. The news was finally announced by Rishi Sunak and EU president Ursula von der Leyen in a highly choreographed, and conspicuously cheery, appearance at Windsor Guildhall – previously better known as the wedding venue for Charles and Camilla, and Elton John and David Furnish. “We have removed the border from the Irish Sea,” Sunak said, in a House of Commons appearance later that felt like a victory lap. But there’s much more to the Windsor agreement, as it is grandly known, than that – and further to go until Brexit can truly be said to be done. As the prime minister heads to Northern Ireland this morning to sell the deal, today’s newsletter is your guide to what we know, and what we don’t. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Palestinian territories | Hundreds of Israeli settlers have gone on a violent rampage in the northern West Bank, setting alight dozens of cars and homes after two of their number were killed by a Palestinian gunman. One man was reported killed in what appeared to be the worst incident of settler violence in the area in decades. Read Bethan McKernan’s dispatch from Huwara, West Bank. UK news | A missing couple that disappeared with their newborn baby in January are in police custody after being arrested in Brighton. Police said that an urgent search was now underway for Constance Marten and Mark Gordon’s child. US media | Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire owner of Fox News, acknowledged under oath that several Fox News hosts endorsed Donald Trump’s lie that the 2020 election was stolen, court documents reveal. Murdoch made the admission during a deposition in a $1.6bn lawsuit brought by a voting machine company that accuses Fox News of defamation. Fertility law | Children born via sperm or egg donation would not need to wait until adulthood to find out more about their biological parents, under proposed updates to the law in the UK. The information would only be shared with the consent of the donor. Politics | Betty Boothroyd, a former Labour MP and the first female speaker of the House of Commons, has died at the age of 93.The current speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said Boothroyd “broke that glass ceiling with panache”. See her life in pictures and obituary. In depth: ‘Sealing the protocol deal was the easy part’ *** What we do know The outline of the changes. For a full breakdown of the key provisions, see this explainer from Lisa O’Carroll. As expected, there will be a “green lane” that almost totally eliminates checks for goods headed from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland, and a “red lane” with more stringent checks for goods that could end up in the EU. The British government will be able to make changes to VAT and alcohol duty in Northern Ireland, and pets will exult in their newfound freedom to cross the Irish Sea. Perhaps most interestingly, while some EU law will continue to apply in Northern Ireland, there will be a “Stormont brake” on its operation. What the “Stormont brake” is. Northern Ireland’s assembly is not currently sitting, because the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) withdrew from power sharing over the protocol. As and when it returns, the government’s framework paper (pdf) sets out that the brake allows 30 of the 90 members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) from two or more parties to raise a petition objecting to changes to EU rules operating in Northern Ireland. The UK government will then notify the EU, and the rule will be suspended unless and until both sides agree it should go back into force. “This would give the UK an unequivocal veto,” the paper says. It also says that the brake “will not be available for trivial reasons” but only if the rule “has a ‘significant impact specific to everyday life’ that is liable to persist”. The DUP’s 25 MLAs could not veto EU rules on their own. And because of the two-party rule, even if the DUP had more MLAs in future, they would still need the support of another party. But there are 12 other unionists in the assembly – so, while not every detail of this mechanism is clear yet, it appears to amount to a unionist veto. The hope is that this power will persuade the DUP to return to Stormont: if they don’t, they can’t use it. Andrew Sparrow has more about how this works here. Here’s a pithier version. UK-EU relations are better than they have been in a while. One trivial index of this was Ursula von der Leyen referring to Sunak as “dear Rishi”, not a phrase you would have heard much in Brussels about his recent predecessors. In general, EU diplomats “gave a cautious response to the Windsor framework”, having only been briefed on Monday, Jennifer Rankin reports. Sunak had a good day. Whether through exhaustion, relief, or tactical delay, there was little immediate sign of dissent from his deal among his MPs – even the European Research Group hardliners are keeping their powder dry. The headlines this morning are largely supportive, as you can see in the front pages section below and in notably warm editorials from the Sun, the Daily Telegraph, and the Daily Mail. But, writes Pippa Crerar in her analysis, “sealing the protocol deal was the easy part … where previous Brexit deals have got into trouble was when they reached the Tory party”. The NI protocol bill is being scrapped. Studious First Edition readers may remember that the “nuclear option” bill – which is on pause in the House of Lords – was designed to give the British government the ability to make unilateral changes to the protocol, probably in defiance of international law. The government said that there was now “no legal justification for enacting [the bill]”. MPs will have a vote on the framework, eventually. Sunak said that “parliament will have a vote at the appropriate time and that vote will be respected”. But he signalled that that could take some time. Some Brexit sceptics say the deal just demonstrates how flawed the underlying project is. “Let no one imagine that Monday’s choreographed signing, grip-and-grins, nor even the king’s gracious blessing, will undo the monumental self-harm of Brexit,” writes Polly Toynbee. Others suggested that the excruciatingly-won benefits for Northern Ireland are … quite similar to the position the whole of the UK was in as part of the EU. Thérèse Coffey has pivoted from British turnips to British sausages, which the government is curiously obsessed with reminding us will now be available in Northern Irish supermarkets. At root, she thinks the deal’s a banger. She is not alone. *** What we don’t know What the DUP will do. The main unionist party’s leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, welcomed “significant progress” but said the DUP would take time to study the detail before announcing whether they would return to power-sharing – one of the key goals of the negotiated changes. Some in his party were highly critical, such as Ian Paisley, who said it did not “cut the mustard”. Rory Carroll writes that Donaldson “may try to sell the deal as a victory” but that “the risk is that rebels in his party, and unionist rivals outside it, will destabilise his leadership”. What Boris Johnson will do. There was some hilarity in the House of Commons last night when Sunak thanked his predecessors “for laying the groundwork for today’s agreement”. Last week, Johnson said that his NI protocol legislation should not be ditched and refused to back a new deal. His opposition would be very dramatic, but not necessarily decisive: even his allies in Westminster may be more interested in what the DUP think. PoliticsHome reports that he has urged the DUP to be “cautious” about any endorsement. While Johnson did not comment publicly yesterday, Aubrey Allegretti reports that he is still “dangling the threat of a rebellion over Rishi Sunak”. How that UK parliamentary vote will go when it happens. Any vote would not be binding on the government’s ability to proceed, and in any case the backing of opposition parties means that success would be assured regardless of what Conservative backbenchers do. But a Tory rebellion, coupled with opposition from the DUP, would still be very tough politics for Sunak. Aubrey Allegretti has more on the Brexit hardliners’ response, and says that Tory strategists believe that any rebellion will be small – “but even a dozen Conservative MPs opposing the deal could trigger bigger problems for Sunak further down the line”. If the rebellion is small, sheer weariness may be a factor. This extraordinary Newsnight interview with Northern Ireland minister and former ERG leading light Steve Baker, who now backs the “fantastic” deal, gives a sense of what the last seven years have cost at least one of the leading protagonists. What the King thought of it all. One sideshow of the last few days has been plans for a role for King Charles in the choreography of the agreement yesterday. In the end, to the outrage of the DUP and Tory Brexiters – who criticised Sunak for dragging the monarch into a highly political moment – he met with Ursula von der Leyen (above) at Windsor Castle. Jessica Elgot has more. How it will change life in Northern Ireland. Beyond Stormont, the fundamental question about the deal is what difference it will make to Northern Ireland’s prosperity, the stability of the Good Friday agreement, and the security of the region – impossible to know for sure until the framework is up and running. Richard Partington hears from NI businesses, who largely welcome the news. What makes this a framework whereas the last thing was a protocol. I could probably find this out, but I choose not to. What else we’ve been reading I loved this interview by Rachael Sigee, who spoke to actor Indira Varma (above) about her impressive, multifaceted career, and ageing in an industry that “places ruthless expiration dates on women”. Nimo The supermarket chain Morrisons was founded on thrift and good value.

Nimo Sport Cricket | England lost to New Zealand (above) by just one run in one of the most dramatic test match finales of all time. The nailbiting result, ending a run of six straight victories for England and making New Zealand only the fourth side in history to win a test after following on, means that the sides draw the two-match series. A near-delirious over-by-over report by James Wallace and Tanya Aldred captures the tension of the final stages. Football | England’s march to the Euro 2022 title has led to Sarina Wiegman being named best women’s coach at the Best Fifa awards in Paris. A key member of that team, Mary Earps, was also named best women’s goalkeeper at Monday night’s ceremony. Barcelona’s Alexia Putellas was named best women’s player for the second year in succession. Tennis | The Lawn Tennis Association believes it faces an “existential threat” if the ban on Russian and Belarusian players continues and it is stripped of its prestigious pre-Wimbledon events such as Queen’s Club and Edgbaston by the sport’s governing bodies. Talks between the LTA and the government continue, with a decision expected by early April. The front pages We have a separate front pages rundown on the Northern Ireland deal today including some island of Ireland editions. Our usual summary follows … “PM hails ‘new chapter’ in relations with EU after Northern Ireland deal” says the Guardian’s front page this morning. The Times is more terse: “Brexit breakthrough”, while the Telegraph says “Sunak: My deal is a new way forward”. “Has Rishi done the impossible?” asks the Daily Mail, and the i has “Sunak secures breakthrough on Brexit – as tensions loom”. “You can put the oven on” – the Metro takes a jab at Boris Johnson there. The Daily Express says “PM: my Brexit deal ‘now takes back control’”. The Financial Times takes a broader view: “Northern Ireland trade deal eases post-Brexit tensions with Brussels”. All that is just a puff box in the Sun – “PM’s historic N Ireland deal” – while the splash is “Broadchurch star dumps Downton star for Better co-star”. The Daily Mirror has “Ripper secret revealed – Evil’s End” – that’s the story that the Yorkshire Ripper’s ashes were scattered at a seaside “beauty spot”, according to a niece.

Cartoon of the day | Steve Bell The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad In many countries across Africa, shifting consumption and lifestyle patterns have meant that meat and dairy have gone from rare luxuries to everyday staples. Vegan chefs, however, have said that this change is not good for the planet, for animals or for people’s health and finances. One of those chefs is Nicola Kagoro, who returned to Zimbabwe after a five-year stint as executive chef at one of Cape Town’s premier vegan restaurants. She quickly found that there was no appetite for her food, as meat had become such a fundamental part of most people’s diets. Seven years on, Kagoro and others have made it their mission to reawaken and remind people of the vegan roots in the cooking of many cultures across the continent. Kagoro now fronts a cookery slot on Zimbabwean television, and is launching a takeaway service next month. “I think there are more African vegans coming out of the closet now,” she says. “They just didn’t speak about it before.” Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday Bored at work?

                    "headline": "A greener Marx? Kohei Saito on connecting communism with the climate crisis",
                    "bodyText": "When academic Kohei Saito submitted his manuscript on Karl Marx, the ecological crisis and arguments for degrowth economics, he hoped it might introduce at least some people in Japan to a new perspective on the climate crisis. Fast forward three years and the subsequent book, Capital in the Anthropocene, has sold more than half a million copies and Saito, a thoughtful 36-year-old, is now something of a Marxist celebrity. “It was a big surprise,” admits Saito on Zoom from his study in Tokyo, “because who cares about Marx and communism?” Now Saito, who says he has not always been a “degrowth communist”, has written a more academic text, Marx in the Anthropocene, which builds on those arguments to propose degrowth communism as a “new way of living”. At a time when degrowth economics is being hotly debated within and outside the environmental movement, Saito’s aim, he explains, is to “overcome the divide between Marxism and degrowth”, bringing together the red and the green. Many in the environmental movement argue that capitalism and its “infinite accumulation on a finite planet … is the root cause of climate breakdown”, writes Saito. But because Marx’s writings on ecology have often been marginalised, there’s a view that his socialism is pro-technological and anti-ecological – supporting the development of technologies to lay the foundation for a post-capitalist society and ignoring nature’s limits, believing it can be dominated by humans. According to Saito, it is possible and necessary to reconstruct Marx so we can see how he analysed economic and ecological crisis. Saito first studied Marx when he was an undergrad at the University of Tokyo, trying to understand degrading working conditions among temporary workers in Japan. After the earthquake and the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, he realised “how capitalism is not just simply exploiting workers but also seriously degrading the environment”. Influenced by scholars who made the case for Marx as an ecological thinker – including Paul Burkett and John Bellamy Foster – Saito sharpened his analysis studying in the US and began to learn German before his next move. It was in Berlin, where he researched his PhD-cum-award-winning book, that he became involved in editing the new complete works of Marx and Friedrich Engels, Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe, including some of Marx’s long-neglected notebooks. “If you look at his notebooks, one realises he studies two weird fields: one is natural science and the other one is capitalist societies.” While Marx was supposed to be finishing Volume II and III of Capital, he was “actually studying natural science, chemistry, geology”. This shift points to a vital change in Marx’s thinking, argues Saito. “With his growing interest in ecology,” Saito writes, “Marx came to see the plunder of the natural environment as a manifestation of the central contradiction of capitalism.” By synthesising these different approaches, Saito developed a “unique way of reading Marx”, he says, as a “degrowth ecological communist”. Degrowth argues that economic growth – the holy grail for governments in most countries – is simply not sustainable and that to stop climate breakdown, we need to reduce consumption. Saito cites Jason Hickel’s work as one example. He is conscious of the critique that denying many countries in the global south the chance to “develop” in the way the north has could be destructive to people who are already very poor. Woven throughout Marx in the Anthropocene is a mindfulness of this global imbalance. “Like many degrowth people I limit the scope of the argument to the global north, developed countries like the UK, Japan and the US. I am obviously pro-growth for those poor countries in the global south.” What is needed to achieve that is a new idea of “abundance” and “progress”, Saito says. Everyone on the planet should have access to the basic things we need to live – electricity, water, education – but “we need to come up with a vision where mass production, mass consumption and mass waste can be avoided.” Crucial to imagining this alternative world is another strand of thinking in Marx’s notebooks: his interest in pre-capitalist, non-western societies. Contra to the ethnocentrism in some of his earlier work, in the end, Marx emphasised “the importance of learning” from these parts of the world “for the western societies”. Informed by this and his ecological studies, Marx’s idea of communism changed significantly, and was no longer growth-driven. “The pre-capitalist society had a unique way of communal regulations of land,” Saito says, “and they also imposed various rules on their production and consumption which realised a more steady-state of sustainable production.” Still, you may wonder why such a deep engagement with a 19th-century thinker matters today. Saito argues that Marx’s way of understanding the relationship between humans and nature – encapsulated in the theory of “metabolic rift”, a vigorously debated subject in Marxist circles – can determine how we respond to the climate and ecological crisis we now face. The basic premise of this thesis is that human/nature interaction is the “basis of living”, but capitalism organises “human interactions with their ecosystems” in such a way that it creates “a great chasm in these processes and threatens both human and nonhuman beings”, Saito says. Some criticise this concept, arguing that it divides nature and society so as to ignore how the former is completely transformed by capitalism. But Saito doesn’t agree. His use of the term Anthropocene is meant to recognise that the “entire planet is now fully transformed by our economic activities”, but he rejects that this means we don not have to distinguish between nature and society. If we understand the two as the same, Saito argues, we risk believing environmental problems can be overcome through more human intervention. We must be attuned to the differences to grasp what “we cannot change” – such as temperature increases due to CO2 and the natural chain reactions that flow from that – and what we can: most urgently “the fossil fuel industry”, Saito says. This makes him sceptical of technological utopianism. Though he had once been optimistic about the possibility of technological progress, he now sees the limitations. “By hoping there will be new technologies, we simply wait until they will be invented but the result will be they will never be and we will be all dead,” Saito says. This is not just a criticism of much-lauded technological fixes within capitalism, such as carbon capture and storage, but of the idea that we can transfer capitalist technologies to an automated communist utopia – where collectively owned robots do the vast majority of the work and there is no more resource scarcity thanks to green energy and things like asteroid mining. Saito welcomes these attempts for imagining a post-capitalist world but sees them as ultimately misguided. “This kind of abundant future appeals to the satisfaction of people’s immediate desires without challenging the current imperial mode of living in the global north,” he observes. “Such a vision accepts too uncritically existing value-standards and consumerist ideals.” Capitalism doesn’t just flout natural scarcity, caring little for the planet’s limits, Saito argues – it artificially creates a social scarcity, where we are always compelled to want more: the latest phone, car or jacket. But we can reorganise our relationship with nature, Saito insists, to imagine a new kind of abundance: regulating advertising, SUV usage and constant mobile phone model changes while “distributing both wealth and burdens more equally and justly among members of the society”. Some sectors – those that don’t make a profit and so are underdeveloped in capitalism – would be improved, which would mean more money and resources for “education, care work, art, sports and public transportation”. Saito maintains this is not a miserabilist alternative future. Pointing to Kate Soper’s thinking, he says that the constant need to engage in competitive work and consumption is not a mark of the good life and in fact limits opportunities for fulfilling experiences outside the market. Without the need to produce for excessive, unnecessary consumption (that which is “necessary” for economic growth, not the development of the individual), jobs could be fundamentally changed. We could spend far fewer hours working, using our abilities and talents to do what we can and sharing the unpleasant and boring tasks more fairly. Saito, though, does not see this as a romanticised “return-to the countryside”, abandoning all technologies in the process; nor is he a Soviet Marxist. Using André Gorz’s distinction between “open” and “locking technology”, he advocates for the former. While the latter is “about domination over people and nature”, where “technology is for discipline and monopoly” – he gives nuclear power plants as an example – open technologies can be run at a local level by cooperatives. Solar panels, for instance, are a more democratic way of “controlling energy and electricity”, he says. This doesn’t amount to doing away with the state entirely, but he stresses: “My vision is not Soviet-style – I am not arguing for the state ownership of everything or state-planned economy.” That would simply change too little. One question, though, is how possible any of this actually is. Saito is aware of the challenges, but he points to Gen Z, Just Stop Oil, climate protests around the world, and Alberto Garzón, the Spanish minister for consumer affairs, who recently wrote about the limits of growth. This is a big change compared with the past 30 years, when such movements have been marginalised. “I am hoping the 2020s and 2030s will become much more turbulent as the crisis deepens,” he says, and hopes that the amount of radical protest will grow and changes in our values will continue to accelerate. “What I am trying to do,” Saito says at the end of our conversation, “is, inspired by these movements, offer something for them … I tried to show why it is necessary to criticise capitalism and why socialism or communism can be a more solid foundation for their movements too.” Marx in the Anthropocene: Towards the Idea of Degrowth Communism is published by Cambridge University Press on 28 February"

                    "bodyText": "Righto, I think we are done here. I’m spent. Spare a thought for Ali Martin who is likely grappling with the mother of all match reports as we speak. How do you even begin to sum that up? It’ll be along soon and very much worth the wait. Safe to say that was easily my most intense OBO session to date. It was a real pleasure as always and all the better for all the correspondence spooling into my inbox from around the globe - all of us hooked and united by this brilliant mad thing at the same time. Very special. Don’t get emotional, that ain’t like you… Thanks to England and New Zealand for that barnstormin’ game, thanks to my fellow Guardian OBO scribes and most of all thanks to you for tuning in and making it what it is. Goodnight, good morning and Vive Test Cricket! Look at that – I’m sure he was watching… and his call of that at the end would have been unmissable. Marnus was watching, course he was: Here’s Ben Stokes: Strawberry blonde quiff dancing in the breeze, he somehow finds the words to sum it all up: That game is what Test cricket is about! The emotions we were going through and the Kiwi boys as well… everyone’s got their money’s worth today. [It was actually free entry at the Basin today but I’m splitting hairs…] We knew that at some point Tim would have to roll the dice, Joe and I knew that was the opportunity to pounce, and sometimes things don’t happen how you want them to… we’re disappointing to end on a loss but four out of five away from home is something we will take great pride in” Alison Mitchell on the BT coverage asks him about his knee and he is admirably honest. Stokes says it is massively frustrating to not be able to give it his all and fulfil the role of a fourth seamer in the side but he is hopeful that there is enough time to get it sorted over the next few months. He really did look crook for large parts of this game and England need his bowling for when the Aussies role into town. Tim Southee speaks: He looks utterly drained and a bit shellshocked. Only a handful of sides have come back from the follow-on to win. Once it digests, the guys will soak it up. The character they’ve shown in the last few days, the guys were calm, if we’d walked off and shaken hands and it wasn’t good enough, it wasn’t good enough. England were class here but Daryl, Kane, Tom Blundell... it was a typical Kiwi scrapping effort” He gives Neil Wagner a shout out for his gargantuan effort with the ball after lunch and then finishes with the following. “It’s great for Test cricket, the way England are playing” He’s not wrong but New Zealand matched them blow for blow in this match and Southee had his calm hand on the tiller throughout. My current predicament: Here’s that winning moment: Harry Brook is Player of the Series: The young tyke has had a princely start to his Test career but was run out without facing a ball today, completely BBQd by Joe Root. Up or down, he’s cool as a kumquat this one. Looking at the pitch on the first day, we didn’t think it’d [the game] would last that long. In the end, it was a very good cricket wicket. It was an enjoyable game to watch!” On getting his first Test scalp as a bowler: I wouldn’t say I am a bowler, I’m just glad that I contributed in that stage of the game and managed to get the breakthrough. That opened it up for us but the result didn’t go our way. Credit to New Zealand, they were fantastic” Kane Williamson is Player of The Match He’s class personified: It doesn’t quite feel right to be standing here, after a game of cricket like that and the contributions we’ve seen from both teams throughout. It was a fantastic game of cricket to be a part of For us as a team, we’ve been fighting away in the Test format for a while so it’s nice to get across the line on this one. This England team is playing incredible cricket at the moment and we were up against it coming into this game. So to fight away, compete and ultimately just get across the line is, is a really nice feeling.” “Hi James, Farheen from India here. What a match this one! What a comeback from the Newzealanders! Only the fourth ever victory in Tests after a team was asked to follow-on. Unsurprisingly, this was the closest of them all. Leach will not want to remember his 1* from this one. Jimmy Anderson gets a taste of Kasprowicz’s agony from Edgbaston 2005. Headlines abound! Brilliant!” Theo Boardman is a happy customer: “Well, if that’s how we’re going to lose them in the Bazball era, then that’s fine with me. What an unreal game. I was convinced the first tied Test in my lifetime was coming there.” That thought had crossed my mind ‘mongst the madness too, Theo. Tim is never wrong: Excuse me whilst I nip off for a err convenience break and I need to drink some water. “What I love about that is that every player on that field knows that they provided top class entertainment. Even England seem happy that they contributed to an amazing spectacle. Stokes is laughing in a FML kind of way. Brilliant.” Gaz ‘Bigdog’ isn’t wrong. Brendon McCullum can also be spotted with a big smile on his face. Don’t be fooled though, that will hurt for England. The camera lingered on an utterly dejected James Anderson at the end and panned away when he started screaming in admonishment at himself (I think!) for what he had done. Wow. That is one of the greatest Test matches you could ever wish to see. One for the history books. Anderson gets a tickle on a short ball and is caught by Blundell behind the stumps. New Zealand have done it! Wagner has done it. What a victory, what a game. By the barest of margins! 74th over: England 256-9 (Leach 1, Anderson 4) Tim Southee to bowl. He goes short and Leach evades. Next ball is fuller and Leach leaves it but the ball darts back dangerously close to off stump! Eeeesh. Leach drives the fourth ball down the ground but it is just stopped by mid-on. No run. And it is a maiden. James Anderson to face Neil Wagner. Two runs or a wicket, that’s the equation. 73rd over: England 256-9 (Leach 1, Anderson 4) This is nuts. Jack Leach steps away and tries to upper-cut Wagner but only gets fresh air. Breathe. Leach tries again and get’s a top edge that lands… SAFE. One run scampered. Anderson to face Wagner. YIKES. Anderson gets one that spits up at his grill and he gloves it just safe. He did well there did Jimmy, a brute of a ball. WOW. Jimmy carves for four! What a shot! The ball traces away to the fence. Anderson just gives a little nod of the head. Two to win for England or a wicket for New Zealand. 72nd over: England 251-9 (Leach 0, Anderson) Anderson blocks out the final two balls from Southee. It is tense. So tense. Leach will be on strike for the next over from Neil Wagner. Folk are emailing me from all over the world, which is lovely, amazing even… BUT I can’t be flicking through the emails right now, my tiny brain can’t compute it all. I’ll get to them I promise. A top edge is held by Wagner on the fine-leg fence! Foakes can’t believe what he’s done. Out comes James Anderson. What a sport. Gulp. 7 runs or 1 wicket. Simple as that. 71st over: England 249-8 (Foakes 33, Leach 0) Wagner steams in, what a spell this has been from him, huge heart and no little stamina to keep smashing the ball into this Wellington pitch. Foakes gets a single with a swivel-pull and leaves Leach with two balls to survive. Does he? He does. 9 runs to win for England. 70th over: England 248-8 (Foakes 32, Leach 0) Tim Southee brings himself into the attack. Ben Foakes gets him away for a couple with a punch through point. Two deliveries left, can Foakes get the single he needs to keep strike? He can! A push into the gap at cover. One ball left at Leach… he survives. On we go. 10 to win for England. Sam Willis sends an epic picture of some misty and mystical Chinese scenery into my inbox with the following note. “I’m up a mountain in China filming a documentary for NatGeo. I’m trying to explain to my cameraman who Jack Leach is and where he fits in the pantheon of England history” This OBO is mind boggingly global. I see you David Keech in Florida, Adam Roberts in the Cayman Islands and Kim Thonger in Somerset. 69th over: England 244-8 (Foakes 29, Leach 0) Ben Foakes you beauty*! A short ball from Wagner is baseball batted straight back down the ground for a blistering four! What a shot that is. Unbelievable. FOUR MORE! The next ball is pulled by Foakes from deep in his crease and it bisects the fielders on the leg-side boundary perfectly. Epic stuff this from Foakes. Wagner responds with a bouncer that is deemed too high and thus a wide, another precious run to England. Foakes gets onto his tip toes to flick off his hip for another single to leave Leach with two to face… Wagner sprays them both down the leg side. A sign he is tiring perhaps? England need 14 runs to win. NZ need 2 wickets. *No bias here. He is v handsome. It’s a fact. 68th over: England 234-8 (Foakes 20, Leach 0) A couple off the over, a no-ball for too many fielders behind on the leg side (wake up dozy!) and a single to Foakes. Leach blocks out the final two. Here comes Wagner! Hello to Chris Taylor: “I really really want to go to bed, but this is ‘Proper Test Cricket’ TM. Gruelling and enthralling. It’s doing my nut and already ruining tomorrow whatever the result. Fantastic.” 67th over: England 232-8 (Foakes 19, Leach 0) Foakes takes on Wagner and just - just – manages to clear the fielder at deep mid-wicket! Four runs to England. It was -who else – Michael Bracewell who had sauntered in off the rope and the ball ended up going JUST over his head and outstretched hand. Foakes clobbers to leg to pick up another couple. England holding on and chipping away. 27 more needed for the win. 66th over: England 225-8 (Foakes 12, Leach 0) Foakes cuts Bracewell for two and then nudges a single. Leach is watchful off the back foot, dead-batting the ball into the ground. Too short from Bracewell who has had such a mixed-bag of a Test match. 65th over: England 222-8 (Foakes 9, Leach 0) Foakes throws the kitchen sink, fridge, kettle and toaster at a Wagner short ball… he top edges… for four! Welcome runs for England, the target into the thirties now. A single brings Leach on strike with two to face. A back foot block and a slightly ruffled duck from Leach. Michael Bracewell is coming on to bowl some spin. He snared Foakes in the first innings, remember that? It feels about eight years ago. 64th over: England 217-8 (Foakes 4, Leach 0) Foakes takes a single off the fourth ball to leave Leach with two balls to survive. Survive he does. Never in doubt. On we go. England need 41 and New Zealand need 2 wickets. “Hi James,” Hello Kevin Tong! “It may be 2am in the UK but it is 10am in Singapore and I AM RIGHT HERE WITH YOU with my eyes glued to the OBO and constantly refreshing for updates! Keep it up!! P.s. I’m supposed to be working” So am I Kevin, so am I. You must’ve downed tools now? 63rd over: England 216-8 (Foakes 3, Leach 0) Foakes turns down a couple of easy singles to keep the strike. I think he has to trust Leach here, it’ll be some job to farm strike for the next 42 runs. He takes a single off the third ball to bring Leach on strike to Wagner. Nearly! Wagner clobbers Leach on the elbow and the ball flies in the air past the close in fielders. Two dots finish the over. I can confirm Jack Leach has not wiped his spectacles once, yet. 62nd over: England 215-8 (Foakes 2, Leach 0) Deja vu hits hard as Henry steams in at Jack Leach who is rock solid in defence. The tension is palpable, I can feel it wafting out of the TV like that scene from Poltergeist. A wicket maiden for Matt Henry. Ian Jefferson is tuning in from San Francisco: “I’m trying to explain to my wife what on earth is going on! She doesn’t have a clue...” She’s not the only one Ian. GONE! Broad tries an uppercut and gets a decent connection but it is straight down the gullett of, who else, Wagner on the fence at third. What a finish this is. England need 43, NZ need two wickets. Jack Leach strides to the crease, he knows how to deal with this sort of thing, don’t you Jack? Jack? 61st over: England 215-7 (Foakes 2, Broad 11 ) Wagner hits the middle of the pitch and Broad takes him on, its thrilling stuff. Broad resembles a blindfolded man trying to swat a piñata out of the branches of a tree. He cloths a few but manages to pick up a couple through mid-wicket. Foakes nudges more conventionally, five runs in total off the over. We do want this to happen really… don’t we? 60th over: England 210-7 (Foakes 2, Broad 7 )My oh my. Broad ramps (you read that right) Matt Henry over the keeper for four! This is Test cricket on speed. A single brings Foakes on strikes and it’s a tad calmer. Henry zones in on Foakes’ pads and he’s forward and blocking. Wagner coming back on,Broad on strike… DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET. Eng need 48 to win. NZ need three wickets. 59th over: England 205-7 (Foakes 2, Broad 1 ) Neil Wagner is pumped, veins throbbing and legs pounding like pistons. What a return this is. He whangs some more short stuff down at Foakes who paddles for a single to bring Broad on strike. Ayeeechi, Broad has a flap at a short one and it lands safe, they scamper one. It’s 2am in the morning here in south London. Everyone in the vicinity is asleep but I am bang into this… whilst remaining quiet as the proverbial ecclesiastical mouse. Erm, thanks Tanya! Root hangs his head and trudges off. Wagner bangs one in short, as predicted, and Root leans back on the shot, splicing tamely straight up in the air where Bracewell takes the catch. Game on! The Revenge of Wagner! England still need 55 and New Zealand need three wickets. Stuart Broad is the new ‘batter’. 58th over: England 202-6 (Root 95, Foakes 0) England need 258 to win Joe Root contemplates a reverse-ramp, but has a last second change of plan. Grins all round. Foakes plays Henry carefully, prodding him back into the pitch, folding everything into place. Right, that’s it from me – Jim Wallace will be your fabulous guide to Root’s century and all the rest. Thanks for all the messages, pedants and all – good night! 57th over: England 201-6 (Root 94, Foakes 0) England need 258 to win Wagner, short sleeves, bustle of a man who likes to get things done. And he gets it done – removing the limping captain and sending down two more fiercely directed bouncers. Foakes swings at the last and Southee goes for the review for a caught behind– but there is nothing on it. The breakthrough! Wagner sends down one of his bumper specials, Stokes has a mad one-handed flail, rocking rapidly onto the back foot, and Latham takes the offering at square leg 56th over: England 200-5 (Root 93, Stokes 33) England need 258 to win Williamson wipes some sweat from his forehead, applies it to the ball then gives it a good polish on his trouser leg. Henry receives the anointed ball, delivers it to Joe Root, who pushes back for no run. Two hundred up for England – 58 to win. 55th over: England 199-5 (Root 92, Stokes 33) England need 258 to win Actually I take it back, he leaks only a couple as a snore rattles the floorboards, from upstairs. A theory on that run out by David Howell: “England have been playing video game cricket for a while now. It was inevitable that, at some point, they’d press the wrong button and set off for an accidental run.” 54th over: England 197-5 (Root 91, Stokes 32) England need 258 to win England happy to play a maiden off Henry, because they know Bracewell is coming the other end. 53rd over: England 197-5 (Root 91, Stokes 32) England need 258 to win Bracewell serving up a mixture of pies and precision, which isn’t quite what Southee wants right now. 52nd over: England 196-5 (Root 90, Stokes 32) England need 258 to win The last time England beat New Zealand at home was in 2008. It looks like that record is about to go, unless New Zealand can take a wicket fast. Henry probes away, Stokes totally foxed by the last ball after wandering down the pitch and resorts to shoving it away. “Hello from the Basin Reserve. Just thinking that if Root hadn’t run out his fellow Yorkshire player, and Brook had then scored at his usual run-a-ball, instead of Stokes’ uncharacteristically slow 28 off 100, England would be home and dry by now.” You lucky thing David Lloyd. Is it as gorgeous as it looks? You might be right, but Root is playing his dues. 51st over: England 195-5 (Root 89, Stokes 32) England need 258 to win New Zealand need to get rid of one of these two poste haste. Stokes looks the most likely – though as I type that he rocks back and pulls a Bracewell pie for four, before grimacing in pain and reaching down to massage the kneecap. 50th over: England 190-5 (Root 88, Stokes 28) England need 258 to win Stokes swings at Henry again, and this time the ball squeezes through the inside edge. An immaculate defensive shot follows. The target now only 68 more. 49th over: England 189-5 (Root 87, Stokes 28) England need 258 to win.Gallop and flick – Root lofts Bracewell up, up and into the stands. The DJ choses Dont You Want ME by the Human League in between overs. 48th over: England 182-5 (Root 80, Stokes 28) England need 258 to win.Stokes plonks down the wicket, throws the bat and gets a huge outside edge flying high, brushing the fingers of Mitchell, leaping at full stretch at slip. Henry rubs his eyebrows in restrained dismay, he’d already seen Root shoot him away between slip and gully for four more. 47th over: England 173-5 (Root 75, Stokes 24) Another maiden – this time Bracewell to Stokes, who looks temporarily befuddled as well as limping. 46th over: England 173-5 (Root 75, Stokes 24) Matt Henry returns, after pulling up in the morning session with a back spasm. He seems to be running in pretty smoothly – and in fact sends down a maiden. Ah, it seems Joe Root has just gone past Steve Waugh’s total of Test match runs – and nudges up to number 11 in the pantheon, just below Allan Border. The highest average in the top ten is Kumar Snagakkara – who spoke at the Oxford Union last week. 45th over: England 173-5 (Root 75, Stokes 24) Root starts the session by calling Stokes through for a rapid single. Bracewell testing Stokes, who in turn tests his legs by wobbling from foot to foot. He then sweeps masterfully for four – but can’t actually get back up from the prone position. “Hi again Tanya,” Martin Wright. “Seems I was wrong (31st over) about that non-striker’s call business. No less an authority than Lord Gower has just slapped me (and many others, apparently) down, insisting that it’s the striker’s call when the ball goes behind square on the offside. Only when it’s down leg does the non-striker call the shots. Ah well, learn something new every day. I look forward to applying it in the middle this summer (and thereby running out vast quantities of my team-mates, as per....).” I also stand corrected. Right, they’re out for the post-lunch session. That Brook run out in all its glory: Over to you Gary! Hello Anthony Baxter: ”All this talk of nightbirds and my thoughts turn to my mate Paul, stuck in his nest in Venice nursing a broken wing (his own bloody fault, for hurtling down a hill in the Dolomites on a vintage bike with dodgy breaks). An OBO shout out might help keep his beak up. Come to think of it, I should have sent this on 111…” Get well soon Paul – hope you can still enjoy Venice in your convalescence. I’m a soft touch this time of night… (but this does look good). Right, with it all in the balance, but Joe Root on the way to atoning for his Yorkshire on Yorkshire sins, I’ve got to make a cup of tea. Back shortly. 44th over: England 168-5 (Root 74, Stokes 20) Southee, smart in black piping , sends down the last over before lunch. Root picks a single, a leaden footed Stokes struggles through the rest of it – ignoring and blocking. Quite the session: 120 runs, four wickets, 33 overs. “Why doesn’t Stokes retire hurt?” asks Stephen Dobbie. “And let Root knock them off with Foakes playing proper test cricket. Surely he could always come back if the Nighthawk and Englands fit all rounder don’t get it done…without troubling the old man into padding up?” I think he would see it as a personal failure. 43rd over: England 167-5 (Root 73, Stokes 20) England need 258 to win.Root, on the charge, has decided he needs to get a wriggle on, so that his captain can limp through till lunch. Crunch, he lifts Bracewell for six. Then a sweeping dab, just over the fielder, for four. Stokes gets a quicker one last ball that nearly skids through the defenses. We’re on the brink of lunch. 42nd over: England 156-5 (Root 62, Stokes 20) England need 258 to win.Might New Zealand, the commentators muse, try some short stuff against the limping Ben Stokes? I think they might. Not this over though. Southee sure and steady. 41st over: England 155-5 (Root 61, Stokes 20) England need 258 to win. Stokes’s knee is causing him serious issues. It seems to lock as he plays a cut shot, momentarily immobilising him. And as he tries to run (after flaying a ball that eventually goes for four) he ends up hobbling like a old man. 40th over: England 151-5 (Root 61, Stokes 16) England need 258 to win. Lovely and full from Southee, finding some swing. Root picks up a couple through third. “I have just got up (I live in Asia) and logged in to check the score. 1443 for 5. A record, surely. Tuesday is obviously going to be a great day.” Craig Shepherd, may I refer you to Pedant’s Corner? You’ll find quite a few OBOers are already there. 39th over: England 149-5 (Root 59, Stokes 16) England need 258 to win. Bracewell has settled into a rhythm now, and England are content to knock him for a fistful of singles. Good news for New Zealand as Henry, after a spell on the rack, is ready to come back on the field. 38th over: England 146-5 (Root 57, Stokes 15) England need 258 to win. England only pick up singles off Southee, but that’s all they need. The target is only 112. On the green slopes of the ground, Wellington locals lean back and shoot the breeze. 37th over: England 143-5 (Root 55, Stokes 14) England need 258 to win. A maiden from Bracewell. “Can we please drop the myth that Brearley was some sort of King Solomon-Alexander the Great hybrid? writes Marcus Abdullahi. “He was whitewashed in Oz, dodged West Indies twice (as well as India away), and with both bat and supposed superbrain cost England a World Cup final. Stokes is streets ahead - and that with Crawley up top rather than prime 1977 Boycott.” Rewrite Brearley? You’ll be telling me Drake wasn’t really playing bowls on Plymouth Hoe next. 36th over: England 143-5 (Root 55, Stokes 14) England need 258 to win. Stokes pushes with hard hands at Southee but luck is on his side, and the thick edge flies behind where it is stopped by a flying Neil Wagner on the boundary. Still half an hour till lunch. 35th over: England 139-5 (Root 54, Stokes 11) England need 258 to win. Bracewell, dirty right knee, trundles in. Lovely action, some nice turn. Stokes is watchful. “I’m not sure about this idea of removing a consonant from Pope’s name,” sniggers Ed Bayling. “It’s the ‘ope that kills you...Anyway, ‘ave a good evening!” 34th over: England 138-5 (Root 53, Stokes 11) England need 258 to win Bad news for New Zealand as Matt Henry pulls up after bowling the fifth ball of the over – it looks as if his bat has spasmed. The physio runs out and pulls him around, stretches his back. He can stand, but not bowl, and walks off the field. Southee finishes the over, which Stokes defends. 33rd over: England 135-5 (Root 52, Stokes 9) England need 258 to win. Southee brings Bracewell back for a settling over, that leaks just one run. Root calls for a drink and Matthew Potts wipes down the bottle with a towel like a good French waiter. Meanwhile Adam Hirst in Rio is suspicious of Root’s motives. I”’m not buying it! Little Joey knew exactly what he was doing there. That’ll teach you to steal my thunder, young man! He’s never made such an ignored century before. He’ll have to score another now to make up for that.” 32nd over: England 134-5 (Root 51, Stokes 9) England need 258 to win Root’s second fifty of the match – in a career of 29 hundreds and 57 fifties. Not Henry’s best over tbh – serves up a wide one for Root to cut for four, and another wide one which Stokes launches into and sends over the slips for four more. Did someone press play on the Bazball tape? “Can anyone see the Northern Lights? You asked a few overs ago. Yes, in my dreams. Of long ago, 1980 in Alaska, on a nuclear base (Don’t ask).” I now have so many question Robert Lewis. 31stth over: England 125-5 (Root 46, Stokes 5) England need 258 to win Root drives through cover one one knee like a man drawing a finger through a bowl of whipped cream before gobbling it up. Evening Tanya,” Hello Martin Wright. “That Brook run out: am I being hopelessly old school in thinking surely it was his call? I mean, when the ball goes behind the wicket, doesn’t the non-striker have the say so? Couldn’t he have just yelled ‘No!’. Or was Root too far down the track? What am I missing here?” Unfortunately the camera angle doesn’t show us what was happening at the non-strikers end but – basically – yes, it should have been. Maybe he didn’t feel confident enough to tell Root no? 30th over: England 120-5 (Root 41, Stokes 5) England need 258 to win Uneven bounce suddenly coming into play. Henry beats Root with one that suddenly flies, he edges -but just short of slip. Then Stokes gets a hot potato, which he edges over the keeper. 29th over: England 117-5 (Root 38, Stokes 5) Root unfurls a straight drive to die for off Wagner. Purrrrrr. From Jonathon Broscombe :“I can’t be the only one … [er] …to have read Kim Thonger’s pedantry in forensic detail and be delighted to point out a dropped consonant in Pope may lead to Poo but not Pop.” 28th over: England 112-5 (Root 33, Stokes 5) Bracewell replaced after that expensive over, by Henry. He’s on point, beating Stokes’ outside edge and the last ball rises out of nowhere, catches the top edge of Stokes’ bat, onto the fingers of BLundell’s gloves and flies over the slips for four. Kim Thonger – what have you done? Ben Smith removes the lid from his fountain pen: “Re. Kim Thonger’s pedantry - ‘Pop’ has been reduced by a vowel, not a consonant. Good to know that as England collapse and Bazball fades into our memory, the OBO can revert to the white heat of pedantry.” And Kevin Rodgers, “Surely to get ‘Pop’ for our teletubby trio you need to remove a vowel from a name, not a consonant. Just sayin’.” Jeremy, “Please tell Kim Thonger for me and all my fellow pedants that if you remove a consonant from the name of Pope you may get Ope or Poe, but certainly not Pop.” And Matt Harriott, “Not one usually one to jump on a bandwagon but if pedantry is the theme of the hour it feels appropriate to point out that Pope less a consonant would be Poe. Maybe the latest iteration of the nighthawk should be The Raven?” 27th over: England 106-5 (Root 31, Stokes 1) An edge! Wagner twisting yarns and Stokes is drawn in – but it falls just short of Latham at slip. They take drinks – New Zealand’s hour. “I suppose after Root’s crazy call, the least he can do to make it up to Harry Brook is to play a (former) captain’s innings in tandem with current captain Stokes.,” taps Colum Fordham. “What a finely poised match. England’s two best players in a precarious position but extremely capable of making amends, with the Kiwis desperate to wreak Revenge on defeat in the first test.Wagner is bowling very well and getting bounce. He Could prove quite a handful. Fine day’s (morning’s) test cricket in prospect.” It should be a thriller! In other news, can anyone see the Northern Lights? 26th over: England 106-5 (Root 31, Stokes 1) Root takes out his frustration on Bracewell – prancing down the wicket to ping him for six, and sweeping him viciously for four. Another short one is dispatched for four more. Southee and Williamson give him a quick pep talk, but the next one is short again – only stopped by Latham’s ribs at short leg. 25th over: England 89-5 (Root 14, Stokes 1) Wagner slips over in his follow through, spears down a pillow on the leg side and Root gratefully accepts a single. England grateful for crumbs right now. 24th over: England 86-5 (Root 12, Stokes 0) Southee, tail up, manages one more. Stokes – Bazball temporarily in the bin - plays out a maiden. Worth staying up for. 23rd over: England 86-5 (Root 12, Stokes 0) Root edges Wagner through the gap where third slip would have been and picks up four. Not a nerve settling four, but a four nonetheless. “Could I respectfully point out to a previous correspondent whose name escapes me,” hisses Kim Thonger, “that Alan Knott had two ts in his name not one. Pedantic it may be but where would we be if we reduced the number of consonants in names willy nilly? Our middle order would be Roo, Broo and Pop which sounds like something from Teletubbies. I cannot let it lie.” And where would the OBO be without a healthy dose of pedans? 22nd over: England 80-5 (Root 6, Stokes 0) Root puts his head in his hands as Brook finishes his first run and trudges off without having faced a ball. Possibly the worst run Root has ever called in his entire career. England now on the rocks. Oooops. Brook run out without facing a ball. Root dabs behind and sets off without looking, but a superb pick up and throw at slip destroys the stumps with Brook still four paces out of his crease. 21st over: England 80-3 (Pope 14, Root 6) The heavy footed Wagner drops short and Ollie Pope slams him through midwicket. Two balls later, he’s on his way. Never quite looked in the mode today. A smashing take tumbling backwards at first slip, as Pope has a limp cut 20th over: England 76-3 (Pope 10, Root 6) A leg bye the only runs off the excellent Southee, who is a weather-beaten mix of Stephen Fleming and Brad Pitt. “Evening Tanya.” Brian Withington! ”Oh, Tom! When did we start picking and choosing our preferred heroic match-winners?! I’d settle for any one of the England team seeing us limp over the line here. 258 looks a very long way at the moment.” 19th over: England 75-3 (Pope 10, Root 6) “It’s never a good sign when one hand comes off the pull shot,” says David Gower, as Pope swats a fly. But he picks up four past the slips, and a couple more as Henry’s over costs 11. 18th over: England 64-3 (Pope 1, Root 4) The excellent Southee keeps the pressure on. Pope off the mark but looks jittery. Root already stepping into his hush puppies. “Can I add my thanks to so many others; as the working day draws to a dank, dark close hear, I’m grateful to the OBO for keeping me in touch with the important happenings of the day. I moved here before my twins were born (to my wife, for clarity) and they turn 19 next month. when they were very little I compared their speech to the nurdle methodology one I Ron Bell utilised at the crease. They’re now full grown exuberant adults, having obviously followed the development of the team in the full Stokes mold.” Thank you John Sims! 17th over: England 61-3 (Pope 0, Root 2) Root picks up a couple immediately off his toes but suddenly England have two new batters at the crease, and the ball is new. “I’d love it if Duckett could be the hero tonight. He’s been there bustling away in the background all winter and putting in cameos, but never quite grabbing the headlines. Meanwhile, Root, Broad, Anderson, Leach and Robinson have all had headlines for their redemption stories following questions being asked about their longevity and ongoing suitability; Pope is being bigged-up as a future captain; Brooke as a future Bradman; Foakes ans the modern Knot and Stokes as the modern Brearley. It’s got to Duckett’s turn to shine today.” Sorry Tom Vd Gucht, posted this just a minute twoo late Well now! Duckett squeezes his eyes shut as he trudges off, his mouth a squeeze of lemon. A daft swipe is picked up by Blundell 16th over: England 53-2 (Duckett 27, Pope 0) The target drops below 200. Tom Hopkins points out possible email issues. My email, which should work… is tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com. “Evening Tanya,” Hello Tom! ”Another Test winter draws to a close and as I’m still not prepared to pay Rupert to watch it the OBO has been my window into Baz’s world. I’ve no idea how you keep it so vibrant in the middle of the night, but I’m very glad you do! Heartfelt thanks to you and all the other OBOers.” Thank you for your very kind words on behalf of my colleagues – the job is a pleasure, whatever the weird hours. 15th over: England 53-2 (Duckett 27, Pope 0) A short wait while the keeper collects his helmet. Some super fielding at slip by Bracewell prevents four squeezing through the cordon. A nervous looking Pope does well to survive a probing over by Henry. 14th over: England 53-2 (Duckett 27, Pope 0) A beautiful over from Southee, who not only gets rid of Robinson but sends down three screaming deliveries at Ollie Pope, the first beating the outside edge by a whisker, the third by a whisper as Pope dances down the pitch. A take-that hoopla with a thick top edge. The ball flies high and behind to backward point where Bracewell holds on with both hands. 13th over: England 53-1 (Robinson 2, Duckett 27) Raised voices filter through from the table tennis match going on next door. Duckett and Robinson – the night owl? – prod at Henry and pick up four with this and that. Apparently England called for the heavy roller this morning. 12th over: England 49-1 (Robinson 1, Duckett 24) An offkey Jerusalem greets Southee. He creeps back to his mark, like a man who has been swimming in his new party trousers. Just a single from the over, a little push into the covers by Duckett. Checkerboard grass at the Basin Reserve. “Shows how England have flipped the script,” says Steven Finn. “250 in the last innings when you’ve been in the field for 200 overs is tricky with fatigue and everything. The fact we’re talking about it how quick they’re going to get the runs rather than the challenge is a credit to the way England play.” Southee has the ball, here we go… It is sunny and altogether gorgeous in Wellington. While I make a quick cup of tea – do send me an email or two. And in another world, some news: The baton was handed over with great grace yesterday as Kane Williamson overtook Ross Taylor to become New Zealand’s highest Test run scorer. Hello and welcome to the final curtain. The culmination of England’s Test winter that started in Rawalpindi on December 1 and finishes three months later a hemisphere and a flat white away. England need just 210 runs for a clean sweep of five wins from five games in Pakistan and New Zealand, and to become the first England team since the 19th century to win all their winter Tests. It would also be their seventh consecutive Test win – and if I’d told you that a year ago, after England had lost all 10 wickets for 56 runs in 22.4 overs at Sydney for a 146-run defeat inside three days and a 4-0 Ashes whitewash, you would sent for the white coats and the concussion Test. The Kiwis, whose stock has fallen nearly as quickly as England’s has risen, need nine wickets to make England the fourth team in Test history to lose after enforcing the follow-on. Throw in a new ball, a michievous pitch, and bullish captains – anything could happen. Zac Crawley must watch from the pavilion, after a brisk one-upmanship innings of 24, 20 of them in boundaries, mulling over his summer chances. He is probably first in line for the chop when YJB – last spotted watching Leeds v Hull at Headingley on Friday night - returns. Nightwatchman Ollie Robinson and Ben Duckett will start the chase at 9.30pm GMT."

Across the street from the Capitol at the supreme court, justices have agreed to hear the Biden administration’s appeal of a lower court ruling that would have defanged the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Here’s what else happened today: TikTok could be banned across the United States, if a bill House Republicans are pursuing becomes law. Primetime TV viewers can tune in tomorrow to a congressional hearing on the Chinese Communist party and how its policies affect the United States. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen has made a surprise visit to Kyiv on the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Marianne Williamson is back, becoming the first Democrat to challenge Joe Biden for the presidential nomination. Democrat Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA analyst who recently won re-election in one of America’s toughest House districts, is jumping into the Michigan Senate race. Elissa Slotkin, a Democratic House lawmaker from Michigan who won re-election last year in one of the most hotly contested races of the cycle, announced she will stand for the state’s open Senate seat in 2024. “I’m running for Senate because I believe that we need a new generation of leaders that thinks differently, works harder, and never forgets that we are public servants,” Slotkin wrote in an email to supporters. She would replace Debbie Stabenow, Michigan’s Democratic senator who has opted not to seek another term. A former CIA analyst who worked in the defense department under Barack Obama, Slotkin banked heavily on her support of abortion rights in her successful run for election last November. John Fetterman’s office has released an update on the senator’s health after the Pennsylvania Democrat earlier this month checked himself into a hospital to be treated for clinical depression. “There’s no real news to report except that John is doing well, working with the wonderful doctors, and remains on a path to recovery,” his communications director, Joe Calvello, said in a statement. “He is visiting with staff and family daily, and his staff are keeping him updated on Senate business and news,” Calvello said. “We understand the intense interest in John’s status and especially appreciate the flood of well-wishes. However, as we have said this will be a weeks-long process and while we will be sure to keep folks updated as it progresses, this is all there is to give by way of an update.” At today’s White House press briefing, national security council spokesperson John Kirby downplayed the energy department’s report into Covid-19’s origins, noting it represents the opinion of just one part of the US government: There was more intelligence-related news this weekend, when the department of energy weighed in on the origins of Covid-19 and found it probably emerged from a laboratory, but could not say for sure. The conclusion will no doubt fuel the ongoing dispute over the pandemic’s origins and the extent to which China deserves blame. The Guardian’s Nicola Davis and Amy Hawkins took a closer look at what exactly the report says: What has the US energy department said about the origin of the Covid outbreak? According to the Wall Street Journal, an updated and classified 2021 US energy department report has concluded that the coronavirus behind the recent pandemic most likely emerged from a laboratory leak but not as part of a weapons programme. Does this report mean it is more likely Covid came from a lab? Not necessarily. The report’s conclusion runs counter to that from several scientific studies as well as reports by a number of other US intelligence agencies. What’s more, experts are unable to scrutinise the evidence the US energy department report is based on. The top Democrats and Republicans in Congress and the leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees will receive a briefing tomorrow on the classified documents found in Donald Trump’s, Joe Biden’s and Mike Pence’s possessions. That’s the word from the Guardian’s Hugo Lowell: The Gang of Eight is an informal term for top lawmakers who are occasionally given classified briefings by the intelligence community. The group today encompasses speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy and the chamber’s top Democrat Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and his Republican counterpart Mitch McConnell, as well as the leaders of the chambers’ intelligence committees: Republican chair Michael Turner and Democratic ranking member Jim Himes in the House, and Democratic chair Mark Warner and Republican ranking member Marco Rubio in the Senate. Lawmakers, particularly in the Senate, have demanded a briefing from Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines ever since the Mar-a-Lago classified documents scandal became public last year. Their calls only grew louder as more documents turned up in Biden’s and Pence’s possession in the months that followed. The FBI recently arrested a Virginia man on allegations that he participated in the deadly US Capitol attack more than two years ago after matching a photo of the shoes he wore at the Capitol that day with a photo of him wearing the same shoes while doing a Crossfit workout, NBC News reporter Ryan J Reilly tweeted Monday. Jeffrey Etter, of Portsmouth, faces charges of illegally entering a restricted federal building as well as engaging in disorderly conduct at the Capitol, according to court documents filed on 22 February. There was no telling on Monday how long it might take for the case against him to be resolved. As of Monday, at least 1,000 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol attack, which a bipartisan congressional report linked to nine deaths, including the suicides of officers who were traumatized after securing control of the building, according to officials. More than 475 of those have pleaded guilty, and a smaller number have been convicted at trial. Supporters of Donald Trump who were trying to prevent the congressional certification of his defeat to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race staged the attack. Trump, who told his supporters to “fight like hell” on the day they targeted the Capitol, has not been among those charged in connection with the attack. The bestselling self-help author Marianne Williamson has announced that she is again running for president in 2024, becoming the first Democrat to sign up to challenge incumbent Joe Biden for the party’s nomination next year. Williamson, 70, ran in the 2020 race which saw Biden oust Donald Trump as president, bringing what the Associated Press described as “quirky spiritualism” to the campaign. In a Facebook post over the weekend that alluded to Trump’s White House victory in 2016 without mentioning him or how it was the Republican’s first time holding elected office, she argued that it was foolish “for anyone to think they can know who can win the presidency”. “I’m not putting myself through this again just to add to the conversation,” Williamson added in the post. “I’m running for president to help … bring forth a new beginning.” Williamson is sure to face the steepest of odds trying to win her party’s nomination over the sitting president. She is scheduled to kick off her campaign in Washington DC on Saturday. Biden hasn’t formally declared himself a candidate for re-election. But first lady Jill Biden gave one of the clearest indications yet on Friday that the president would seek office again, telling the AP in an interview that there is “pretty much” nothing left to do but set the time and place for the announcement. In a separate interview with CNN published on Monday, Jill Biden was asked if there was any chance her husband wouldn’t run. “Not in my book,” Jill Biden said. Jill Biden added that she was “all for it, of course”, when asked if she supported her 80-year-old husband’s search for a second term in the White House. The Ohio train derailment has found its way on to Congress’s agenda, where House and Senate lawmakers say they are determined to get answers, but will also probably use the accident as a cudgel against their political opponents. Across the street at the supreme court, justices have agreed to hear the Biden administration’s appeal to a ruling that would have defanged the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Here’s what else has happened today so far: TikTok could be banned across the United States, if a bill House Republicans are pursuing becomes law. Primetime TV viewers can tune in tomorrow to a congressional hearing on the Chinese Communist party and how its policies affect the United States. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen has made a surprise visit to Kyiv on the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. After the East Palestine train derailment, Democrats have accused Donald Trump of laying the groundwork for the accident by deregulating the freight rail and chemicals industries during his presidency. But a Washington Post fact check of some of those arguments shows they don’t hold water, at least based on the information currently available. “From our analysis, none of the regulatory changes made during the Trump administration at this point can be cited as contributing to the accident,” the piece concludes. However, there does seem to be some difference of opinion on whether electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brakes could have made a difference in the crash. Barack Obama’s administration promulgated a rule that would have required this more sophisticated braking system on all “high hazard” trains. Trump put that rule on hold when he took office in 2017, and Joe Biden hasn’t reinstated it. Indeed, his chair of the National Transportation Safety Board Jennifer Homendy has said it would not have made a difference even if it had been in place. However, there’s this, from the Post’s fact check: “Cynthia Quarterman, who helped write the rule as administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration during the Obama administration, told The Fact Checker that if the rule had not been delayed and then shelved, she believes ECP brakes might have been widely adopted by industry and could have ended up on this train.” Last week, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin announced he was pulling out of New Start, its last major nuclear arms control treaty with the United States. Perhaps he spoke too soon. CNN reports that the state department says Russia was still complying with the treaty as recently as today: Want to help Ukraine? Adopt an orphan. That’s the message from the leader of one non-profit, as the Guardian’s Ramon Antonio Vargas reports: Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine a little more than a year ago, some in the US have shown their support for the encroached country by volunteering to fight for it while others have called on politicians to equip the defenders with munitions and weapons. Randi Thompson is calling on Americans to ponder another way: aiding efforts to place Ukrainian children orphaned by the Russian invasion in new families within their country. Thompson is the president, chief executive officer and co-founder of the Los Angeles-based non-profit Kidsave, which is dedicated to connecting older children in institutionalized care around the world with families to adopt them. The group had worked in Ukraine for six years before the invasion by Russian forces on 24 February 2022 made a bad situation worse. Officials estimate there were more than 105,000 children across 700 orphanages, boarding schools and other institutions in Ukraine when the war there started – that’s more than 1% of the nation’s underage population and Europe’s highest rate of youth institutionalization. Numbers since then are harder to track as children have been evacuated and moved out of Ukraine’s institutionalized care for safety reasons. But there’s reason to think things have gotten only harder for Ukraine’s orphans. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen has made a surprise visit to Kyiv, where she’s underscoring Washington’s continued support for Ukraine one year after Russia invaded. We at the Guardian have a separate live blog with all the latest Ukraine news, which you can follow along here. In other regulatory news, Punchbowl News reports that House Republicans are moving forward with a bill that would allow the president to ban social media app TikTok: Despite its worldwide popularity, TikTok has been a subject of increasing concern in Washington due to its ownership by Chinese firm ByteDance. Lawmakers of both parties fear the Chinese Communist party could be controlling ByteDance, and using TikTok as a way to access users’ data. Late last year, Congress banned the app from government-owned devices. In March, TikTok’s CEO Shou Zi Chew is expected to testify before the Republican-controlled House energy and commerce committee. Before she became a senator, Democrat Elizabeth Warren played a major role in the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She advised Barack Obama on the agency’s set-up, and takes credit for proposing the idea behind it. Here’s what she has to say about the supreme court’s decision to review an appeals court decision that, if upheld, could defang the agency: Despite years of desperate attacks from Republicans and corporate lobbyists, the constitutionality of the CFPB and its funding structure have been upheld time and time again. If the Supreme Court follows more than a century of law and historical precedent, it will strike down the Fifth Circuit’s decision before it throws our financial markets and economy into chaos.” The supreme court has agreed to hear the Biden administration’s challenge to an appeals court ruling that could have defanged the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to ensure Americans are treated fairly in the financial sector. The conservative-dominated high court will review an October decision from the fifth circuit court of appeals, where three judges appointed by Donald Trump ruled the CFPB’s funding mechanism was unconstitutional. According to the Washington Post, the Biden administration has argued that the decision “calls into question virtually every action the CFPB has taken in the 12 years since it was created.” The CFPB has long been in conservatives’ crosshairs, and in 2020, the supreme court allowed the president to fire its director, but held back from the more expansive ruling business groups were hoping for: Here’s more on the latest challenge, from the Post: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act moved to insulate the CFPB from political influence by making the agency independent from an annual appropriation from Congress. Instead, it is funded from the operating reserves of the Federal Reserve, which itself is funded through bank assessments. The 5th Circuit judges agreed with two financial associations who were challenging the CFPB’s regulations regarding payday lenders and argued that the agency’s structure was unconstitutional. They said the structure violated the constitutional command requiring congressional appropriation of any “Money … drawn from the Treasury.” The appeals court vacated the payday lending rule and said it was taking that action not because the CFPB lacked authority over the issue but because of “the Bureau’s unconstitutional funding scheme.” U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar told the Supreme Court that the 5th Circuit decision was in direct conflict with every other court that looked at the funding structure. “The court of appeals’ novel and ill-defined limits on Congress’s spending authority contradict the Constitution’s text, historical practice, and this Court’s precedent,” Prelogar wrote in a petition asking the justice for review. “And the court of appeals compounded its error by adopting a sweeping remedial approach that calls into question virtually every action the CFPB has taken in the 12 years since it was created.” Republican congressman Mike Gallagher, chair of the newly created House select committee on China, says he hopes the panel’s first primetime hearing on Tuesday will be to impress that the Chinese Communist party’s influence is “not just an over-there problem” but a matter of “American sovereignty”. “We have a responsibility to communicate not only to our colleagues but also the American people why any of this matters,” Gallagher told reporters on Monday, previewing tomorrow night’s hearing. He said that panel’s work was designed to expose how the CCP’s “Orwellian model of totalitarian control is designed not just for the roughly 12 million Uighur Muslims living in an open air prison, or even the nearly one and a half billion Chinese citizens but increasingly, for all of us.” Gallagher added that his expectations were realistic – accepting that the panel’s hearings likely wouldn’t pull in “Netflix viewership”. But he hopes that by embracing methods that are a “little bit outside the box”, the panel can lay out a compelling case for why Americans should care about the CCP. As an example, the members intend to hold events and showcases, possibly including audiovisual “wargaming”, in addition to hearings. On Saturday, Gallagher held an event in New York with Democratic congressman Ritchie Torres at the site of a former CCP-run police station used to monitor and harass Chinese citizens living in exile. On Tuesday, the panel will hear from four witnesses, including former national security adviser HR McMaster and former deputy national security adviser and journalist Matt Pottinger. The panel’s first hearing will be an intentionally broad preview of the work it plans to do over the next two years. The Wisconsin lawmaker said he anticipates future hearings on land purchases by Chinese citizens, Taiwan, TikTok and the way China exerts control over US companies that operate there. Gallagher said he was hopeful that much of the work would be conducted in a bipartisan fashion, commending the makeup of the committee. He also emphasized that the committee’s mission was focused on the Chinese government, not its people, whom he called the “primary victims of CCP repression.” The committee was established on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. But several House progressives objected to the panel’s creation, worrying that it would exacerbate anti-Asian American hate, which has increased sharply since the start of the pandemic. Gallagher said the committee formally defines the relationship between China and the US as one of “strategic competition”. But, he said: “The reality is, it isn’t a tennis match. It’s about what kind of world we want to live in.” Representatives of federal agencies went door-to-door in East Palestine, Ohio, this weekend, checking on families affected by the disaster, according to the White House. The teams composed of Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Emergency Management Agency and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff spoke with 350 households by the end of the weekend, and expected to hit their target of 400 families later today, a White House official said. Here’s an interview from Fox News with the leader of the CDC’s response to the derailment: If you pay attention to rightwing media, you’ll hear certain terms thrown around about the East Palestine disaster. The Guardian’s Ed Pilkington and Nina Lakhani report on how conservatives are attempting to make the environmental catastrophe about race: Until 2 February it was business as usual in the small rural community of East Palestine, Ohio. The local paper carried obituaries and sporting results, interspersed with stories of a homecoming queen, an abusive puppy mill and the driver in the Toughest Monster Truck Tour who was arrested for human trafficking. The next day it all went up in flames. “Train derailment sparks massive fire, prompts evacuations.” “Videos show major fire raging after tanker train derails.” The derailment of a 50-car freight train carrying toxic materials on 3 February shattered daily life in East Palestine and sent a pall of black smoke over the region. Potentially lethal chemicals spewed into the air, ground and water. Three weeks into the disaster, a new set of headlines has started to billow up from rightwing outlets and commentators. Now the tragedy of East Palestine has morphed into a racialized lament for the “forgotten” people abandoned by the uncaring “woke” Biden administration. For “forgotten”, read white. With Democrats in Congress demanding answers from America’s freight rail companies, Adam Lowenstein reports on how the industry has in recent years spent handsomely on political contributions, public relations and other methods aimed at crafting public opinion: Six children, smiling and laughing, sit at a table with lunch boxes open in front of them. “Hey guys! My dad can stop a train with his finger,” one brags. “My mom can see into the future,” another says, holding up her hands as binoculars. “My mom? She speaks train,” a third claims. Just then, her mom walks into the room. Another child asks if it’s true that she can talk to trains. “You betcha,” she says with a wink, as she stands in front of a sky-blue sign emblazoned with the logo of the Norfolk Southern Corporation. The kids’ conversation takes place in “Everyday Superheroes”, a 2018 video created for Norfolk Southern, the $12.7bn operator of the train carrying toxic chemicals that derailed earlier this month in East Palestine, Ohio, causing an environmental disaster of still unknown proportions. The derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals that may have done long-lasting, potentially life-changing damage to a small Ohio community is certainly the type of calamity Congress is equipped to look into. And on the surface, the hearings announced by a House and a Senate committee thus far seem intent on doing just that. “Thousands of trains carrying hazardous materials, like the one that derailed in Ohio, travel through communities throughout the nation each day. Every railroad must reexamine its hazardous materials safety practices to better protect its employees, the environment, and American families and reaffirm safety as a top priority,” Maria Cantwell, the Democratic chair of the Senate commerce committee, wrote in a letter sent to the heads of the US’s top freight rail companies. Republican House commerce committee chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Bill Johnson, who leads the environment, manufacturing and critical materials subcommittee and also represents the district encompassing East Palestine, addressed their letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) head Michael Regan. They asked for “information to our Committee regarding the EPA’s overall response, the controlled burn of some of the rail cars, and its testing plan to ensure people are kept safe”. Both sound like serious efforts to get to the bottom of the derailment, and they may well be. But they’re also opportunities for each party to make the case that the other is responsible for laying the groundwork for the disaster. For Republicans, they’ll argue the buck stops with Joe Biden and the leaders he’s chosen for the EPA and transportation department. For Democrats, don’t be surprised if they bring up Donald Trump, arguing his deregulation policies were friendly to the rail industry at the expense of the communities around their tracks. Good morning, US politics blog readers. East Palestine, Ohio, became America’s latest political battleground earlier this month when a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in the small community, sparking fears of life-changing pollution for its nearly 4,800 residents. Congress is now poised to get involved, with lawmakers of both parties pledging to hold hearings into the incident. For Democrats in the Senate, the focus looks to be on whether government deregulation and corporate malfeasance contributed to the accident. House Republicans, meanwhile, may see it as another opportunity to turn the public against the Biden administration. Here’s what else is going on today: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will hold a White House event to celebrate Black History Month at 5pm eastern time. Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will take reporters’ questions at 2.30pm. The House and Senate are back in action, though no votes are expected."

                    "bodyText": "It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has met with Volodymyr Zelenskiy and other key Ukrainian government officials in a surprise visit to Ukraine to reaffirm Washington’s support for Kyiv. Yellen said following talks with prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, that the US has provided nearly $50bn in security, economic and humanitarian assistance and announced another multibillion-dollar package to boost the country’s economy. Belarusian anti-war partisans claim to have severely damaged a Russian military aircraft in what an opposition leader has called the “most successful diversion” since the beginning of the war. BYPOL, the Belarusian partisan organisation, said it had used drones to strike the Machulishchy airfield 12km from Minsk, severely damaging a Beriev A-50 airborne early warning and control aircraft (Awacs). Russian forces have escalated shelling and infantry assaults in the Bilohorivka, Svatove-Kupiansk and Kreminna areas of Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk province, according to the region’s governor Serhiy Haidai. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a video address early on Friday, said the situation in the east was “very difficult, painful” but that Ukrainian forces were “doing everything to withstand it”. Ukraine’s ministry of defence claimed in total to have shot down 11 of 14 drones deployed, including nine over Kyiv. Air raid alerts sounded across Ukraine’s Kyiv region late on Sunday night as Kyiv’s regional military administration confirmed the country’s air defences were at work. Two emergency service workers were killed and three other people injured during a drone attack on Khmelnytskyi, according to city’s mayor. Russia “will likely be concerned that unexplained explosions are occurring” in and around Mariupol, a location “at least 80km away from the frontline … [which] it had probably previously assessed as beyond the range of routine Ukrainian strike capabilities”, the UK’s ministry of defence has claimed in its latest daily intelligence briefing on the war. The airline carrier Wizz Air has announced it will suspend flights to Moldova’s capital, Chisinau, from 14 March due to concerns about the safety of its airspace. In a statement, the company said it had taken the “difficult but responsible” decision to suspend flights because of the “high, but not imminent” risk in Moldova’s airspace. Russia is paying “a great deal of attention” to China’s peace plan to end Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and its details will need to be analysed in detail, the Kremlin has said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said any initiatives that might bring peace closer were worthy of attention, but that Russia was continuing to prosecute its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine and that, for now, he didn’t see any signs suggesting a peaceful resolution could be achieved. The US is “confident” that China is considering providing lethal equipment to support Russia in Ukraine, according to the CIA director, William Burns. In an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday, Burns said he was “confident that the Chinese leadership is considering the provision of lethal equipment” but noted “we also don’t see that a final decision has been made yet, and we don’t see evidence of actual shipments of lethal equipment”. A Ukrainian court has sentenced two captured Russian soldiers to prison for taking part in the shelling of residential areas in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian security service (SBU) said. One of the soldiers received a 10-year sentence and the other has been jailed for nine years, the SBU said in a statement. Poland has announced a joint initiative with the European Commission to trace Ukrainian children who have been abducted and taken to Russia during the ongoing war in Ukraine. The aim of the scheme is to track down the missing children and to “ensure those responsible are brought to justice”, Poland’s EU affairs minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sęk said. “We need to return the abducted children to Ukraine and punish russia for its crimes,” Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said. A Ukrainian Nobel peace laureate has called for the swift creation of a special tribunal to try Vladimir Putin and his associates for the crime of aggression, Oleksandra Matviichuk, the head of the Centre for Civil Liberties, told the Guardian that a speedy start to war crimes trials against the Russian president and soldiers it could have “a cooling effect” on atrocities committed by the Kremlin’s invading forces. The UN chief, António Guterres, has warned that respect for human rights has gone into reverse, and called for a renewal of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 75 years after its signing. Pointing to the war raging in Ukraine, and threats to rights from soaring poverty, hunger and climate disasters, António Guterres said the declaration was “under assault from all sides”. He said the “Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered the most massive violations of human rights” being witnessed in the world today. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, is due to visit Beijing on Tuesday for a meeting with Xi Jinping, in a high-profile trip symbolising the widening gulf between the US and China over the war in Ukraine. Xi’s meeting with Lukashenko, a close ally of Putin, is seen internationally as a sign of where China’s sympathies lie. Gleb Pavlovsky, a Russian political scientist and Vladimir Putin’s former adviser who later became one of his most prominent critics, has died at the age of 71, according to local reports. Pavlovsky had been an influential figure in Russian politics in the first decade of Putin’s rule, serving as the Russian president’s adviser and “political technologist”. Vladimir Putin has given an award to actor Steven Seagal for international humanitarian and cultural work, a state decree published on Monday showed. Seagal, a frequent visitor to Russia, backed Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 as “very reasonable”, joined a pro-Kremlin party in 2021, and visited a Russian-controlled part of eastern Ukraine last summer, where he met with a Russian-backed separatist leader. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine live blog today. Thank you for following. I’ll be back tomorrow. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires of the besieged town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. Russia’s suspension of participation in the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as New Start, has not yet come into force, according to a US official. The assistant secretary for the US bureau of arms control, verification, and compliance, Mallory Stewart, said she expected treaty notifications will cease once Russia’s suspension is finalised. Speaking at an event at Brookings Institution, reported by CNN, she said: The suspension hasn’t been officially affected yet in the sense that we’re still receiving notifications, as recently as today, under the treaty, regular notifications. But we expect that as soon as that suspension has been formalised, that those will stop. Vladimir Putin announced Russia will halt its participation in New Start, the last major remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the US, in a speech last week devoted to the one-year anniversary of Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Russian leader claimed the US wanted “to inflict a strategic defeat on us and claim our nuclear facilities”. However, the Russian foreign ministry later said Moscow intended to continue abiding by the restrictions outlined in the treaty on the number of warheads it can have ready. The US is “trying to follow up” with the Russians “to truly understand what else could be included in the suspension, and what could be continued”, Stewart said. She added: Right now we expect it will just be the launch notifications under that 1988 agreement, and that they said they’ll abide by the actual numerical limitations. Earlier we reported that the European Commission is launching a joint initiative with Poland to trace Ukrainian children who have been abducted and taken to Russia during the ongoing war in Ukraine. The Commission’s spokesperson, Dana Spinant, has tweeted about the initiative, which she said would be unveiled in the coming days. Russian forces have sent thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia, Spinant said in a news conference. She said: The abduction of Ukrainian children is a great social problem, a tragedy and a crime. The aim of the initiative is “to join forces to collect evidence that the abducted children can be found and those responsible for the crime are brought to justice”, she said. The airline carrier Wizz Air has announced it will suspend flights to Moldova’s capital, Chisinau, from 14 March due to concerns about the safety of its airspace. In a statement, the company said it had taken the “difficult but responsible” decision to suspend flights because of the “high, but not imminent” risk in Moldova’s airspace. It said: Wizz Air has been closely monitoring the security situation in Moldova and has been constantly in contact with various local and international authorities and agencies to ensure the highest level of safety and security of operations. The safety of passengers and crew remains Wizz Air’s number one priority, and as a result of recent developments in Moldova and the high, but not imminent, risk in the country’s airspace, Wizz Air has taken the difficult but responsible decision to suspend all flights to Chisinau starting on March 14. It said it would lay on extra flights from the Romanian city of Iasi as replacements. Earlier this month, Moldova temporarily closed its airspace for several hours to investigate reports of a balloon-like object in the sky, a day after the small east European country accused Russia of plotting to bring down its government. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has also posted about his meeting with Janet Yellen, the US Treasury secretary, in Kyiv today. Zelenskiy described the meeting as “important,” writing in a Telegram post that the US has been “powerfully supporting” Ukraine since the invasion not just with weapons but with financial aid. He added: It is necessary to further strengthen sanctions to deprive Russia of the ability to finance the war. US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has posted a photo of her meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during her surprise visit to Kyiv. America will “continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes”, Yellen wrote on Twitter. In a private meeting with Zelenskiy late in the afternoon, Yellen commended him “for his leadership and resolve in the face of Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war”, the US Treasury said. The Treasury said she welcomed Zelenskiy’s actions to strengthen governance and address corruption – actions needed to ensure that US economic aid is being spent responsibly. Here are some images we have received from the news wires of the US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, in Kyiv. The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has met with Volodymyr Zelenskiy and other key Ukrainian government officials in a surprise visit to Ukraine to reaffirm Washington’s support for Kyiv. Yellen, flanked by sandbags at the Ukrainian cabinet ministers’ office, told the prime minister, Denys Shmyhal: America will stand with Ukraine as long as it takes. In a phone briefing with reporters, she said Russia should bear the costs of damage caused by its invasion of Ukraine, but there are “significant legal obstacles” to fully seizing the $300bn (£249bn) in Russian central bank assets frozen by sanctions. She said the US and its allies were discussing strategies to ensure that Russia pays for the devastation that its war, with estimates in the hundreds of billions of dollars and growing every day. Yellen also said Washington would study Kyiv’s calls to impose sanctions on Russia’s nuclear energy sector, but needed to be “mindful” of the potential consequences of such an action on western allies. She said: We want to deprive Russia of revenue. We also need to look at potential consequences of the sanctions for ourselves and our partners. She also announced the transfer of the first $1.25bn (£1.04bn) from the latest, $9.9bn (£8.23 bn) tranche of economic and budget assistance from Washington. Shmyhal, speaking through an interpreter, said he and Yellen discussed further US sanctions on Russia aimed at weakening its economy and military and “confiscating frozen Russian assets and putting them to the benefit of the recovery of Ukraine”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmtryo Kuleba, has accused Russia of the “genocidal crime” of “stealing” Ukrainian children, claiming that it is “probably the largest forced deportation in modern history”. Kuleba, in a video address at an event on the sidelines of the UN human rights council, said: The most chilling crime is that Russia steals Ukrainian children. Kyiv has collated thousands of reports of its children being forcibly deported to Russia and has called for these deportations to be investigated as a war crime. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Belarusian anti-war partisans claim to have severely damaged a Russian military aircraft in what an opposition leader has called the “most successful diversion” since the beginning of the war.

Air raid alerts sounded across Ukraine’s Kyiv region late on Sunday night as Kyiv’s regional military administration confirmed the country’s air defences were at work. The nearby northern city of Chernihiv also reported shooting down Iranian-made Shahed drones, according to its regional governor, Vyacheslav Chaus. Ukraine’s ministry of defence claimed in total to have shot down 11 of 14 drones deployed, including nine over Kyiv. Two emergency service workers were killed and three other people injured during a drone attack on Khmelnytskyi, according to city’s mayor.

Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and close ally of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, is due to visit Beijing on Tuesday for a meeting with Xi Jinping, in a high-profile trip symbolising the widening gulf between the US and China over the war in Ukraine. US officials spent the weekend reiterating their concerns that Beijing is considering sending lethal weapons to Russia, amid China’s attempts to position itself as a peacemaker and deny that it would provide arms to Moscow. Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Jake Sullivan, the White House’s national security adviser, said the US was “watching closely” for any such shipment, which Beijing “hadn’t taken off the table” as a possibility. William Burns, the director of the CIA, said in an interview with CBS News on Sunday that the US was “seriously concerned should China provide lethal equipment to Russia”. “We don’t have evidence of a final decision to do that … all we’re trying to emphasise is the importance of not doing that,” Burns said. Read the full story here: Poland has announced a joint initiative with the European Commission to trace Ukrainian children who have been abducted and taken to Russia during the ongoing war in Ukraine. The aim of the scheme is to track down the missing children and to “ensure those responsible are brought to justice”, Poland’s EU affairs minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sęk said. Szynkowski vel Sęk told reporters at a Saturday press conference: The whereabouts of many of these children are unknown. Estimates vary widely, but even the most restrained ones speak of at least six thousand cases of documented child theft. The scheme will involve “investigative activities to collect specific evidence” of abductions and “establish a mechanism allowing the problem to be dealt with”, he said. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said Kyiv was grateful to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. Posting to Twitter today, Shmyhal said: We need to return the abducted children to Ukraine and punish russia for its crimes. A US-backed report published earlier this month said Russia has held at least 6,000 Ukrainian children – likely many more – in sites in Russian-held Crimea and Russia whose primary purpose appears to be political re-education. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has given an award to actor Steven Seagal for international humanitarian and cultural work, a state decree published on Monday showed. Reuters reports the decree said the 70-year-old actor had been given Russia’s Order of Friendship. There was no immediate reaction from Seagal. The decree mentioned Seagal’s work as a special representative of Russia’s foreign ministry for humanitarian ties with the United States and Japan. Seagal, a frequent visitor to Russia, backed Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 as “very reasonable”, joined a pro-Kremlin party in 2021, and visited a Russian-controlled part of eastern Ukraine last summer, where he met with a Russian-backed separatist leader. Ukraine in 2017 banned Seagal from entering for five years on national security grounds. Putin presented him with a Russian passport in Moscow in 2016. Russian state-owned news agency Tass reports that in Sevastopol in Crimea, Russian security services claim to have detained two suspects accused of being recruited by Ukrainian secret services to “transfer information for a monetary reward about the location of objects of the ministry of defence of the Russian Federation, the leakage of which abroad could damage the country’s defense capability”. Tass reports that the two have been charged with treason, and could face up to 20 years in prison. They have initially been detained for two months. Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014, in a move not widely internationally recognised. A planned concert by the subversive Slovenian industrial rock band Laibach in Ukraine has been cancelled after the group angered Ukrainians by remarks interpreted to suggest that Kyiv was a client state fighting a war for its western masters, AP reports. The group was scheduled to play Bel Etage Music Hall on 31 March, and claimed they were to be the first foreign group to perform a full concert in Kyiv since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. They said the concert aimed to show support for the Ukrainian people during the war, but organisers said its remarks caused “controversy” and discord, forcing the cancellation. In remarks to the Guardian published last week, the group lamented the conflict in Ukraine as “a cynical proxy war for the geostrategic interests of the superpowers and financial capital (of the military industry, etc)”. The group’s statement was compared by many Ukrainians with Russian state propaganda that portrays the invasion as a conflict with Nato and reduces Ukraine to a puppet state of the west, according to Slovenia’s STA news agency. In a Facebook post late on Sunday, the Bel Etage Music Hall said: While the team showed support for Ukraine and Ukrainians and condemned the Russian regime, a large part of the audience came out categorically against Laibach’s visit. It added: In order to prevent the unnecessary division of Ukrainians into different camps and to eliminate the cause of discord, we have decided to cancel the Laibach concert at Bel Etage. Laibach told STA they were “categorically asked to declare that all Russians are bad and that all Russian art is worthless, which of course they did not agree to do”. In a statement on Facebook, the group said “to all those who doubt our views, let us therefore once again make it very clear that Russia is the main aggressor in this clash of destructive political and geostrategic interests”. A Ukrainian court has sentenced two captured Russian soldiers to prison for taking part in the shelling of residential areas in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian security service (SBU) said. One of the soldiers received a 10-year sentence and the other has been jailed for nine years, the SBU said in a statement. The men were not named in the statement, but it said both “took an active part in the storming of Ukrainian cities on the Eastern Front” and were captured last year. It said one of the soldiers had started fighting for Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and fought for the Russian army in the Bakhmut area of eastern Ukraine last year. The other was in charge of Russian troops that shelled the eastern cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine, and was captured along with a number of his subordinates, it said. The statement said: As a result of investigative actions, indisputable evidence on the guilt of two more militants who joined the ranks of the occupation groups of the aggressor country at the beginning of the full-scale invasion was collected. The SBU said both soldiers were found guilty under laws on the encroachment on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine, and on participation in paramilitary or armed formations not provided for by law. Gleb Pavlovsky, a Russian political scientist and Vladimir Putin’s former adviser who later became one of his most prominent critics, has died at the age of 71, according to local reports. He died after a “serious illness”, Simon Kordonsky, a professor at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics, told the Vedomosti business daily on Monday. Pavlovsky had been an influential figure in Russian politics in the first decade of Putin’s rule, serving as the Russian president’s adviser and “political technologist”, the Moscow Times reports. He founded the Effective Policy Foundation, a political strategy firm that worked on the presidential campaigns of Boris Yeltsin, Putin and Viktor Yanukovych, among others. He was instrumental in the development of Russia’s “managed democracy” that saw Putin’s rivals marginalised, exiled or jailed. He also played the role of a spin doctor, hosting a weekly political segment on Russian state television in the mid-2000s. He was sacked from the presidential administration in 2011, reportedly for backing the then president Dmitry Medvedev’s re-election over Putin’s return to the presidency. After leaving the Kremlin, he became an outspoken critic of Russia’s top leadership. In an interview with the Financial Times published last February, said: Putin’s used to being lucky. That’s very dangerous for a gambler, because he starts believing fate is on his side. When you play Russian roulette, you feel that God is on your side until the shot rings out. Russian forces have escalated shelling and infantry assaults in the Bilohorivka, Svatove-Kupiansk and Kreminna areas of Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk province, according to the region’s governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai, in remarks to Ukrainian state television and quoted by Reuters, said: There is no fleeing, our units do not leave territory. Moreover, there is success in certain sectors. They are advancing, they can deoccupy areas. Of course, everything can change at any moment. He added: On the other hand, western offensive heavy equipment is on the way and therefore in any week the military command can conduct an operation following the same plan as they did in the Kharkiv region. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a video address early on Friday, said the situation in the east was “very difficult, painful” but that Ukrainian forces were “doing everything to withstand it”. Here are some images that have been sent to us from the news wires of Lyman, a key eastern city that was recaptured by Ukrainian troops in October. Russia is paying “a great deal of attention” to China’s peace plan to end Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and its details will need to be analysed in detail, the Kremlin has said. Beijing has called for peace talks while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians, in a 12-point position paper on Ukraine that was released on Friday, on the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said any initiatives that might bring peace closer were worthy of attention. He told reporters during a regular briefing: We are paying a great deal of attention to the plan of our Chinese friends. Of course, the details need to be painstakingly analysed taking into account the interests of all the different sides. This is a very long and intense process. He added that Russia was continuing to prosecute its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine and that, for now, he didn’t see any signs suggesting a peaceful resolution could be achieved. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has cautiously welcomed Beijing’s peace plan but said it would be acceptable only if it led to Vladimir Putin pulling his troops out from all occupied Ukrainian territory. Western leaders are sceptical about the proposal, and argue that Beijing does not have the international credibility to act as a mediator.

Belarusian anti-war partisans claim to have severely damaged a Russian military aircraft in what an opposition leader has called the “most successful diversion” since the beginning of the war. BYPOL, the Belarusian partisan organisation, said it had used drones to strike the Machulishchy airfield 12km from Minsk, severely damaging a Beriev A-50 airborne early warning and control aircraft (Awacs). “One of the nine Awacs of the Russian aerospace forces worth $330m (was destroyed),” said a statement attributed to BYPOL. “These were drones. The participants of the operation are Belarusians. (They have attained) ‘Victory’ and are now safely outside the country. Everyone has escaped,” said one statement attributed to Aliaksandr Azarau. The plane “definitely won’t fly anywhere”, the group added. According to some reports, the aircraft was hit by munitions dropped by two drones. A second munition reportedly hit close to the cockpit. “The front and middle section of the aircraft were damaged, as well as avionics and a radar antenna,” said a report attributed to BYPOL. The damage to the aircraft has not been independently confirmed, although both Russian and Belarusian military bloggers have reported explosions on Sunday at the airfield. One also confirmed “damage to a Russian military transport plane”. Read the full story here: China has derided US sanctions on Chinese companies, as part of its targeting of the Russian private mercenary Wagner group and its affiliates, describing them as “illegal” and accusing the US of “outright bullying and double standards”. The sanctions “have no basis in international law or authorisation from the Security Council, and are typical illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction”, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing. The measures were “seriously harming China’s interests” and China “strongly rejects and deplores that and has lodged solemn complaints with the US side”, Mao said. She added: While the US has intensified its efforts to send weapons to one of the parties to the conflict, resulting in an endless war, it has frequently spread false information about China’s supply of weapons to Russia, taking the opportunity to sanction Chinese companies for no reason. This is outright bullying and double standards. The US has sanctioned the Chinese company Changsha Tianyi Space Science and Technology Research Institute, also known as Spacety China, for providing satellite imagery of Ukraine to support the Wagner group’s combat operations for Russia. A Luxembourg-based subsidiary of Spacety China was also targeted. Air raid alerts sounded across Ukraine’s Kyiv region late on Sunday night as Kyiv’s regional military administration confirmed the country’s air defences were at work. The nearby northern city of Chernihiv also reported shooting down Iranian-made Shahed drones, according to its regional governor, Vyacheslav Chaus. Ukraine’s ministry of defence claimed in total to have shot down 11 of 14 drones deployed, including nine over Kyiv. Two emergency service workers were killed and three other people injured during a drone attack on Khmelnytskyi, according to city’s mayor. Belarus’s exiled opposition has claimed partisans destroyed a Russian plane at an airstrip near the capital, Minsk, on Sunday. “Partisans … confirmed a successful special operation to blow up a rare Russian plane at the airfield in Machulishchy near Minsk,” tweeted Franak Viacorka, a close adviser of opposition figurehead Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. “This is the most successful diversion since the beginning of 2022.” The two Belarusians who carried out the operation had used drones, he said, adding that they had already left the country and were safe. Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said on Monday that talks with Sweden and Finland regarding their Nato membership bids would resume on 9 March, after a delay in January in the wake of a Qur’an-burning protest. The meeting will take place in Brussels and will include discussion on the implementation of the memorandum signed between the countries. It later emerged that the Qur’an-burning incident in Stockholm was funded by a far-right journalist with links to Kremlin-backed media. Respect for human rights has gone into reverse, the United Nations chief warned Monday, calling for a renewal of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 75 years after its signing. Pointing to the war raging in Ukraine, and threats to rights from soaring poverty, hunger and climate disasters, António Guterres said the declaration was “under assault from all sides”. He said the “Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered the most massive violations of human rights” being witnessed in the world today. “It has unleashed widespread death, destruction and displacement,” he said. The UK’s ministry of defence has claimed that “Russia will likely be concerned that unexplained explosions are occurring” in and around Mariupol, a location “at least 80km away from the frontline … [which] it had probably previously assessed as beyond the range of routine Ukrainian strike capabilities.” The US is “confident” that China is considering providing lethal equipment to support Russia in Ukraine, according to the CIA director, William Burns. In an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday, Burns said he was “confident that the Chinese leadership is considering the provision of lethal equipment” but noted “we also don’t see that a final decision has been made yet, and we don’t see evidence of actual shipments of lethal equipment”. China has always maintained communication with all sides in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including Kyiv, a foreign ministry spokesperson told a regular news briefing on Monday. Russia’s former president said in remarks published on Monday that the continued arms supply to Kyiv risks a global nuclear catastrophe, reiterating his threat of nuclear war over Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev’s apocalyptic rhetoric has been seen as an attempt to deter the US-led Nato military alliance and Kyiv’s western allies from getting even more involved in the war. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you for the next few hours. A Ukrainian Nobel peace laureate has called for the swift creation of a special tribunal to try Vladimir Putin and his associates for the crime of aggression, arguing that it could have “a cooling effect” on atrocities committed by the Kremlin’s invading forces. Oleksandra Matviichuk, the head of the Centre for Civil Liberties, also said a speedy start to war crimes trials against the Russian president and soldiers could save people’s lives by deterring Russian forces from committing further crimes. Starting legal proceedings could have “a cooling effect” on the brutality of human rights violations that Russian troops were committing daily in Ukraine, she told the Guardian in an interview. Some troops, perhaps not all, would realise that Putin’s authoritarian regime had an end date, Matviichuk said, if they knew they would be held to account. The possibility of justice would help them realise “I will not be able to hide under abstract Putin and maybe I will have to be responsible for every thing which I commit by my own hands,” she said. Read more of Jennifer Rankin’s interview and report here: Ukrainian Nobel peace laureate calls for special tribunal to try Putin Here is a recent view of the military cemetery in Dnipro that has just been sent to us over the news wires. The Kremlin said on Monday it was worried about the state of affairs in Moldova’s breakaway Transnistria region, where it said Ukraine and other European countries were stirring up the situation. Moscow last week told the west that it would view any actions that threatened Russian peacekeepers in Transnistria as an attack on Russia itself, a warning that came amid increased concerns in Moldova, a small ex-Soviet republic located between Romania and Ukraine, of a possible Russian threat. Moldova’s pro-European president, Maia Sandu, this month accused Moscow of plotting a coup, something Russia denied. “Naturally, the situation in Transnistria is the subject of our closest attention and a reason for our concern,” Reuters reports Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the media. “The situation is unsettled, it is being provoked, provoked from outside. “But we know that our opponents in the Ukrainian regime, the Kyiv regime, as well as those in European countries, are capable of various types of provocation.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has dismissed Moscow’s assertion that Ukraine wants to take over the region, while Moldova said there was no truth to the allegations. Vadim Krasnoselsky, the self-styled president of Transnistria, had earlier described the situation in the region as tense, but urged people to remain calm and said that citizens would be informed immediately should any threat of danger arise. Respect for human rights has gone into reverse, the United Nations chief warned on Monday, calling for a renewal of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 75 years after its signing. Pointing to the war raging in Ukraine, and threats to rights from soaring poverty, hunger and climate disasters, AFP reports António Guterres as saying the declaration was “under assault from all sides.” “Some governments chip away at it. Others use a wrecking ball,” he told the opening of the UN Human Rights Council’s main annual session, describing the disregard and disdain seen for human rights around the world as “a wake-up call”. He said the “Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered the most massive violations of human rights” being witnessed in the world today. “It has unleashed widespread death, destruction and displacement,” he said. AFP reports that a second person has died as a result of Russian drone attacks overnight. It quotes Oleksandr Symchyshyn, mayor of Khmelnytskyi, saying “Unfortunately, we have another hospital death. Doctors failed to save the life of another hero, a rescuer”. Earlier, the mayor and Ukraine’s ministry of defence reported that someone from the emergency services had been killed. Ukraine claims to have shot down 11 of 14 drones deployed by Russian forces. Nine were downed over the capital, Kyiv, the head of the city’s military administration said, and there were no reported casualties or damage to infrastructure. The official, Sergiy Popko, said Russian forces were trying “to exhaust our air defences”, and said the attack had come in two separate waves. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Ukraine. Ramon Antonio Vargas has spoken to Randi Thompson, president of Los Angeles-based nonprofit Kidsave, who is calling on Americans to aid efforts to place Ukrainian children orphaned by the Russian invasion in new families within their country. Read more here: Ukrainian children orphaned by war ‘need a tremendous amount of help’ Just to add to that report from the Ukraine ministry of defence that an emergency service worker was killed in Khmelnytskyi overnight, AFP is reporting that the mayor of Khmelnytskyi, Oleksandr Symchyshyn, has said: “For now, we know of one dead and four injured” after the drone attack on the city. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has claimed that overnight its forces shot down 11 Iranian-made Shahed drones. It also confirmed that an officer of Ukraine’s emergency services was killed in Khmelnytskyi. The claims have not been independently verified. China has always maintained communication with all sides in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including Kyiv, a foreign ministry spokesperson told a regular news briefing on Monday. Reuters reports Mao Ning was answering a question on Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying he would welcome talks with China. In another question on Zelenskiy saying that he planned to speak to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, Mao said: “China’s position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and very clear.” “The core is to call for peace and promote dialogue and promote a political solution to the crisis. We have always maintained communication with the sides involved including Ukraine,” Mao said. Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said on Monday that talks with Sweden and Finland regarding their Nato membership bids would resume on 9 March, after a delay in January in the wake of a Qur’an-burning protest. Reuters reports that speaking in Ankara, Çavuşoğlu said the meeting would take place in Brussels and would include discussion on the implementation of the memorandum signed between the countries. It later emerged that the Qur’an-burning incident in Stockholm was funded by a far-right journalist with links to Kremlin-backed media. In its latest daily intelligence briefing on the war, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has raised the issue of explosions in occupied Mariupol. It writes: Since 21 February 2023, pro-Russian officials have reported at least 14 explosions around the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol. Sites of the incidents have included an ammo cache at the airport, two fuel depots, and a steel works that Russia uses as a military base. Mariupol lies at least 80km away from the frontline. Russia will likely be concerned that unexplained explosions are occurring in a zone it had probably previously assessed as beyond the range of routine Ukrainian strike capabilities. Although widely devasted earlier in the war, Mariupol is important to Russia because it is the largest city Russia captured in 2022 that it still controls, and sits on a key logistics route. The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, has reported on the Telegram app that trams and trolleybuses in the port city of Odesa have stopped this morning because of a shortage of electricity.

You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russia’s former president said in remarks published on Monday that the continued arms supply to Kyiv risks a global nuclear catastrophe, reiterating his threat of nuclear war over Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev’s apocalyptic rhetoric has been seen as an attempt to deter the US-led Nato military alliance and Kyiv’s western allies from getting even more involved in the war. The latest comments by Medvedev, an ally of President Vladimir Putin who serves as deputy chairman of Putin’s security council, follow Putin’s nuclear warning last week and his Sunday remarks casting Moscow’s confrontation with the west as an existential battle for the survival of Russia and the Russian people. Of course, the pumping in of weapons can continue .... and prevent any possibility of reviving negotiations,” Medvedev said in remarks published in the daily Izvestia. Our enemies are doing just that, not wanting to understand that their goals will certainly lead to a total fiasco. Loss for everyone. A collapse. Apocalypse. Where you forget for centuries about your former life, until the rubble ceases to emit radiation.” Belarus’s exiled opposition has claimed partisans destroyed a Russian A-50 surveillance military aircraft in a drone attack at an airstrip near the capital Minsk on Sunday. Franak Viacorka, a close adviser of opposition figurehead Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, tweeted: Partisans … confirmed a successful special operation to blow up a rare Russian plane at the airfield in Machulishchy near Minsk.

The participants of the operation are Belarusian … They are now safe, outside the country.” The Guardian has not been able to independently verify the reports. Front and central parts of the aircraft as well as the radar antenna were damaged as a result of two explosions in the attack at the Machulishchy air base near Minsk, BYPOL reported. The Beriev A-50 aircraft, which has the Nato reporting name of Mainstay, is a Russian airborne early warning aircraft, with airborne command and control capabilities, and the ability to track up to 60 targets at a time, according to Reuters. As battles continue to rage across Ukraine’s eastern front here are some of the latest images to come through our newswires. The UN human rights council is set to meet today in a united call to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and extend its investigation into war crimes in the conflict. Days after the United Nations general assembly in New York voted overwhelmingly to demand Russia immediately withdraw from Ukraine, the war is expected to dominate the opening of the top UN rights body’s main annual session in Geneva. We’re looking for this session to show, as the UN general assembly showed … that the world stands side-by-side with Ukraine,” British ambassador Simon Manley said at an event Friday marking the one-year anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion. The meeting, which is due to last a record six weeks, will be the first presided over by new UN rights chief Volker Turk, who kicks the session off early Monday. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, will also address the council on the first day, while nearly 150 ministers and heads of state and government will speak, virtually or in person, during the four-day high-level segment. Among them will be the top diplomats of the US, China, Ukraine and Iran. Moscow will send deputy foreign minister Sergey Ryabkov to address the council in person on Thursday. One key resolution will be on extending a high-level investigation into crimes committed in Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion. The so-called Commission of Inquiry, which has already determined that Russia is committing war crimes on a “massive scale” in Ukraine, is due to present a comprehensive report to the council in late March. The commission must “continue its important work, which is of paramount importance for the principles of accountability and justice”, Yevheniia Filipenko, permanent representative of Ukraine to the United Nations office in Geneva, told reporters on Friday. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold. The UN human rights council is set to meet today in Geneva in a united call to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and extend a probe into war crimes in the conflict. Days after the United Nations general assembly in New York voted overwhelmingly to demand Russia immediately withdraw from Ukraine, the war is expected to dominate the opening of the top UN rights body’s main annual session. US officials have also warned China against providing lethal aid to support Russia’s war on Ukraine. CIA director William Burns said he is “confident” that Beijing is considering providing the equipment to Moscow’s forces but a final decision has not been made yet and there has been no evidence of actual shipments of lethal equipment. It’s 7.30am in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The US is “confident” that China is considering providing lethal equipment to support Russia in Ukraine, according to the CIA director, William Burns. In an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday, Burns said he was “confident that the Chinese leadership is considering the provision of lethal equipment” but noted “we also don’t see that a final decision has been made yet, and we don’t see evidence of actual shipments of lethal equipment”. The US has made clear behind closed doors that such a move would have serious consequences. The White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in an interview with CNN’s State of the Union programme: “Beijing will have to make its own decisions about how it proceeds, whether it provides military assistance, but if it goes down that road, it will come at real costs to China.” Vladimir Putin has accused the west of seeking to “dismember” Russia and to turn the vast country into a series of weak mini-states. In an interview with the state TV channel Rossiya on Sunday, the Russian president claimed the US and its Nato allies wanted to “inflict a strategic defeat on us”. The aim, he said, was to “make our people suffer”. Putin has claimed Russia had no choice but to take into account the nuclear capabilities of Nato as the US-led military alliance was seeking the defeat of Russia. “In today’s conditions, when all the leading Nato countries have declared their main goal as inflicting a strategic defeat on us, so that our people suffer as they say, how can we ignore their nuclear capabilities in these conditions?” Putin told Rossiya 1 state television, according to Tass. “They tried to reshape the world exclusively on their terms. We had no choice but to react,” he said, adding that the west was complicit in Ukraine’s “crimes”. Ukraine’s military has dismissed claims by Russia’s Wagner mercenary group that it had captured Yahidne, a village on Bakhmut’s northern outskirts. It said intense fighting was going on across the whole frontline. On Saturday the founder of the Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his forces had taken Yahidne and the nearby village of Berkhivka. The latest Ukrainian update cited “unsuccessful” Russian offensives in the two settlements and four others. All were subject to heavy shelling, it said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy fired a senior military commander in charge of fighting Russian troops in Ukraine’s east. The Ukrainian president dismissed Eduard Moskalyov as commander of the joint forces of Ukraine, which are engaged in battles in the Donbas region, but gave no reason for the move on Sunday. Belarus’s exiled opposition has claimed partisans destroyed a Russian plane at an airstrip near the capital Minsk on Sunday. “Partisans … confirmed a successful special operation to blow up a rare Russian plane at the airfield in Machulishchy near Minsk,” tweeted Franak Viacorka, a close adviser of opposition figurehead Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. “This is the most successful diversion since the beginning of 2022.” The two Belarusians who carried out the operation had used drones, he said, adding that they had already left the country and were safe. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify the reports. Joe Biden has said the prospect of China negotiating peace between Ukraine and Russia is “just not rational”. Speaking on ABC News about China’s peace plan, the US president said: “I’ve seen nothing [that] would indicate there’s something that would be beneficial to anyone other than Russia. The idea that China is gonna be negotiating the outcome of a war that’s a totally unjust war for Ukraine is just not rational.” The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said he expected the contracts for the backfilling of howitzers that Berlin rushed to Ukraine last year to be signed by the end of March – months earlier than originally planned – “if everything works out”. Talking to German public broadcaster ARD on Sunday, he did not specify the number of weapons to be reordered. Pistorius also said it was up to Kyiv to decide when, and under what conditions, to enter talks with Moscow. He suggested the same was true for any decision on recapturing the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Washington is reportedly in talks with Berlin and Warsaw to hold joint military manoeuvres in Poland in response to Russia’s threat to the eastern border of the Nato alliance. Exercises were being “considered”, Pistorius told Germany’s ARD, without confirming or adding any details “for now”. He said military manoeuvres in a country bordering Ukraine – invaded one year ago by Russia – would send a “very clear” signal to Nato allies “but also to Putin”."

                    "bodyText": "With an in-tray bulging with the war in Ukraine, the Chinese threat to Taiwan and the potential collapse of the Iran nuclear deal, the US state department has tried to avert its gaze from the clouds gathering over Israel and Palestine, but has now found it impossible to do so. Since John Kerry, as secretary of state, expended diplomatic muscle trying to revive the Middle East peace process in the final year of the Obama administration, US Democrats have gently welcomed the rapprochement symbolised by the Abraham accords, but have not done much else. However, the advent of the most rightwing government in Israel’s history, and violence spiralling out of control, have shown the dangers of light-touch diplomacy. So the summit in the city of Aqaba on Sunday, the first of its kind in a decade, between military officials from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, the US and the host Jordan, seemed a belated chance to limit the damage. For all the talk of it being a “security” as opposed to a “political” summit – a description designed to minimise resentment among domestic audiences unwilling to negotiate – the event was a chance to bring a modicum of political control to the streets. The Palestinian Authority, after all, has severed cooperation with Israel on security issues. With the violence worsening, the meeting seemed the least participants could do. The joint communique issued by Jordan afterwards committed Israel to “stop discussion of any new settlement units for four months and to stop authorisation of any outposts for six months”. It promised a regional security commission and a further summit in a month. A US national security adviser welcomed the meeting as a starting point. But the breathing space that had apparently been created was suffocated within hours, the time it took for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to issue a tweet contradicting the summit’s conclusions. He tweeted that “the building and authorisation in Judea and Samaria will continue according to the original planning and building schedule, with no change”, using the biblical term for the West Bank. “There is not and will not be any freeze.” The denials seemed symbolic of the chaos with which the new Netanyahu coalition government has conducted itself since being elected in December. It also reflected the outsized power that the hardliners Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, the national security and finance ministers respectively, are allowed to wield inside the coalition. Ben Gvir, who has a conviction for inciting racism, is in ministerial charge of the police. Smotrich has control of the military’s responsibility for civilian issues in the occupied territories, including the settlement project. Both men rejected the summit conclusions. “What happened in Jordan (if it happened), will remain in Jordan,” said Ben Gvir. In a sense, he was right. Within hours, the summit seemed an irrelevance. By Sunday afternoon, two Israeli settlers had been shot dead by a Palestinian gunman, and by Sunday evening, crowds of settlers had burned and vandalised buildings and cars in Palestinian villages in the West Bank. Too few Israeli soldiers were present to stop the torching. The genesis of the summit was a low-key meeting between Israeli and Palestinian representatives that took place a fortnight ago, where it was agreed to calm the area. One of the results of the meeting was that the Palestinians withdrew a vote against Israel in the UN security council, saving the Biden administration from having to use its veto to protect an administration whose domestic policies, including the neutralising of the judiciary, it often abhors. Now the US has a decision to make. Having redipped its toe in the Palestinian question by orchestrating the Jordan summit, it will have to decide whether to do more than make a minimal ritualistic call for restraint on both sides. It could possibly ask pointed questions about the motives of the Israeli politicians nominally controlling the military. It could start to question the democratic direction of Israel. So far, there has been little sign that Biden is prepared to do that, but many more nights like those in Hawara, and the calculation may change."

                    "bodyText": "Donald Trump is fond of telling interviewers that he has a “very thick skin”, but it now appears that it was insufficiently robust to prevent Jimmy Kimmel jokes from getting under it while he was in the White House. Rolling Stone has revealed that in early 2018, a year into Trump’s presidency, he became so incensed with the late-night host’s jabs that he ordered White House officials to complain. At least two calls were made, the magazine reports, to top executives at Disney, which owns ABC, the channel which broadcasts Jimmy Kimmel Live. “Nobody thought it was going to change anything but [Trump] was focused on it so we had to do something,” one unnamed former presidential administration official told Rolling Stone. Kimmel replied over the weekend to the revelation that all his Trump needling had been effective. “Another perfect call …” he said, riffing off Trump’s brag about the “perfect call” he made to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that helped land him in his first impeachment. Like most late-night hosts, Kimmel responded to the advent of the Trump presidency with alacrity. At the time the calls to Disney were being made, the comedian was comparing Trump to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and inviting a porn star on to the show to describe lewd acts she had allegedly committed with him. “Happy New Year, everybody. We have two maniacs with nuclear warheads bragging about who has the bigger button,” Kimmel said in his first show of 2018, referring to Kim and Trump. Days after news broke that Trump had paid $130,000 through his personal lawyer to Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about an alleged affair, Kimmel interviewed her. He read to her a description that she had given of having sex with Trump in 2006 and asked her was it true. “Define true,” she replied. That Trump should be riled by such late-night punches is perhaps understandable. That he should use the mighty power of the Oval Office to try to stomp them out is the kind of behaviour that has earned him comparison with the late Richard Nixon, who after the Watergate scandal became the only US president to resign from office. Nixon also suffered from a president’s occupational hazard of letting public jabs get under his skin. He once grew so apoplectic towards a newspaper columnist that he planned to kill him by smearing a massive dose of LSD on the steering wheel of his car."

                    "bodyText": "The Iranian revolution is at a do-or-die moment, requiring western governments to give their full, active support or risk seeing the movement’s impact wane, Reza Pahlavi, the oldest son of the former Shah of Iran who was deposed in 1979, has said in a Guardian interview. Pahlavi said there were signs that if the west imposed maximum pressure, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and some reformist politicians would desert the regime. Exiled since he was 17 and sometimes described as the “crown prince”, Pahlavi has joined forces with high-profile young activists inside and outside Iran to forge an alliance. They are trying to draw up a charter based on a set of secular democratic principles, which a constituent assembly would use as the basis of a constitution to be put to a referendum. The charter was due to have been published at the end of February but was temporarily delayed to allow for the consultation of Kurdish groups. Pahlavi, who is on a European tour, has two key demands of the west: to help Iranians avoid the regime’s suppression of the internet, and to proscribe, rather than just impose sanctions on, the IRGC. He said: “The reason the revolution is continuing is because everybody understands this is do-or-die. Iranians are calling for ‘death to the dictator’. They are getting shot in the eyes and, if not, imprisoned or tortured or executed, and they are still standing there. The world needs to respond and be on their side.” So far, the campaign, which was given a platform at the Munich security conference instead of the Iranian foreign ministry, has been unable to persuade either the EU or the UK to proscribe the IRGC. The suspicion is that diplomats fear proscription would kill the small chance of reviving the Iran nuclear deal. The CIA director, William Burns, said on Sunday that Iran was nearing the uranium-enrichment level of a nuclear state, but had not resumed weaponisation. Pahlavi said: “Political expediency often has a problem with freedom-loving movements. The fact some governments are suggesting the protests are tapering off is perhaps because they want to justify some re-engagement and negotiations. It’s a bit like South Africa at the end of apartheid. Governments tried to ignore the issue until it was impossible to do so.” In parallel with supporting labour strikes in Iran, he said proscription of the IRGC would cripple its operations worldwide. He said the IRGC, as distinct from the regular army, “is an armed paramilitary mafia that controls every aspect of the country, but only the top echelons of the IRGC benefit from this. The lower ranks have to decide if they want to be used as an instrument of repression, or to consider this regime is on its last legs and they should take the exit strategy being offered to them, through truth and reconciliation, and return to the bosom of the nation. In my vision of regime change, the lower paramilitary ranks peel away from the regime, but that requires maximum pressure by the west.” He said there were signs that some reformist politicians – those he said were in the “grey zone” – such as Mir Hosssein Mousavi, the former prime minister, were realising the regime was not capable of reform. “The discourse of the reformists is increasingly: ‘Forget about reform. It is not going to work, and we need to think past this regime.’ There is a convergence with what we are saying.” Pahlavi denied his presence in the new opposition alliance harked back to the past, or made the movement ideologically incoherent. “I am not here to be president or the next monarch. I am here to use my political capital and the trust that people have in me to be instrumental in helping the transition process. My only mission in life is to see the day the Iranians go to the polls and decide their own fate.” But, he added: “If afterwards I can contribute by helping to institutionalise checks on concentration of power, or corruption, or abuse of power or a new political culture… that is where I think I can be most effective”. He said some saw value in the institution of the monarchy, as a force bringing the country together. “I want to be a neutral element. I am neither in the camp of the monarchists or republicans.” As to the record of his father, who was accused of human rights abuses and corruption, he said: “I am my own person with my own thoughts.” But nor did he disown his father’s rule, brought to an end by the 1979 revolution. “Obviously there were some mistakes made. Nobody denies that. But net, if you look at the balance, most people say the country was moving forward. Iran was prospering. Had it not been for this revolution, we should at least have been South Korea. Instead, we are North Korea.” He said he did not condone torture, and denied it was ever state policy. “People do not look at me as going back to the past. They look at me and see someone moving towards a future.” He dismissed suggestions the current campaign had no purchase inside Iran, and was just a motley collection of diaspora activists. “It originates from inside Iran, and that is why it has legitimacy. This is not something we concocted to export to Iran. Quite the opposite. We are the voice of those inside Iran that cannot openly advocate for obvious reasons. It is a diverse group: left, right, centre, republicans and monarchists.” He said he welcomed other political charters being floated, as they had been in recent days, and said his alliance’s proposal would be worthless if it did not have signoff from within Iran. “In terms of time, we do not have a gun to our head. If people need time to consult, so be it.” He argued the revival of the nuclear deal – the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPoA) – would only benefit China, not the west. “It is curious to me that the Biden administration is so hell-bent on rejuvenating a JCPoA, when first time round the west did not benefit economically. As long as this regime is in power there will be a complete block on cooperating with the west. That is the mindset.” But that does not lead Pahlavi to support a military attack on Iran’s nuclear sites, which Israel favours. He said he understood Israel felt it faced an existential threat, but “we cannot jump from failed diplomacy to military confrontation. There is a third way, and that is to give that extra push to the people in the streets to help end this regime. It would be historically criminal not to give that process a chance before you resort to other options.”"

                    "headline": "Lukashenko’s planned Xi meeting shows gulf between China and the US",
                    "bodyText": "Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and close ally of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, is due to visit Beijing on Tuesday for a meeting with Xi Jinping, in a high-profile trip symbolising the widening gulf between the US and China over the war in Ukraine. US officials spent the weekend reiterating their concerns that Beijing is considering sending lethal weapons to Russia, amid China’s attempts to position itself as a peacemaker and deny that it would provide arms to Moscow. Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Jake Sullivan, the White House’s national security adviser, said the US was “watching closely” for any such shipment, which Beijing “hadn’t taken off the table” as a possibility. William Burns, the director of the CIA, said in an interview with CBS News on Sunday that the US was “seriously concerned should China provide lethal equipment to Russia”. “We don’t have evidence of a final decision to do that … all we’re trying to emphasise is the importance of not doing that,” Burns said. On Friday, China published a 12-point “position paper” on the war in Ukraine, calling for peace and positioning itself as a neutral peacemaker in the conflict. However, the paper reiterated Beijing talking points that criticised the use of sanctions and “expanding military blocs”, an apparent reference to Nato. China has echoed Russia’s claim that the war in Ukraine was provoked by Nato’s expansion close to Russia’s borders. The paper also urged all parties to refrain from nuclear escalation, a position that Beijing shares with the US and other western leaders. China has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but has also tried to position itself as a peacemaker. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, has said that China lacks credibility for such a role. The US’s increasingly vocal statements about China potentially sending weapons to Russia came after Der Spiegel reported last week that the Russian military was in negotiations with Xi’an Bingo Intelligent Aviation Technology, a Chinese drone manufacturer, to produce kamikaze drones for Russia. The company denied having any business dealings with Russia. “China’s policy to the war is the policy of declaring neutrality, supporting Putin, and paying no price,” says Steve Tsang, the director of the Soas China Institute in London. With the repeated public statements about sending weapons to Russia, the US may be trying to make clear to the Chinese that providing dual-use technology, which could have military applications, would be damaging to Chinese interests. “It is never crystal clear to the Chinese what will trigger sanctions,” said Tsang. The US is trying to remove any doubt. Military assistance to Russia “will come at real costs to China”, Sullivan said on Sunday. Western sanctions would cause “colossal damage both economically and politically to Xi’s leadership”, said Yu Jie, a senior research fellow on China at the Chatham House thinktank. US politicians are increasingly unified in their opposition to Beijing, which will be on show at a House of Representatives committee meeting on Tuesday on dealing with the strategic threat posed by China. Beijing is keen to reset its ties with Europe, an important trading partner. Chinese exports to the EU were worth €472bn (£416bn) in 2021. Last year China’s economic growth was just 3%, the worst since 1976 and a figure that Xi is keen to boost by opening up China’s borders and restoring economic relations with important trading partners. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, and Charles Michel, president of the European Council, are expected to visit Beijing in the first half of this year. President Joe Biden has dismissed China’s peace plan as containing nothing “beneficial to anyone other than Russia”. However, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said that “the fact that China is engaging in peace efforts is a good thing”. Bobo Lo, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said Washington’s increasingly vocal warnings about China’s support for Russia is an attempt to tell Europe that “Beijing may seem to be playing nice, but it hasn’t changed its stripes”. That much was clear when China blocked the G20 from issuing a joint statement condemning the war in Ukraine on Saturday. Xi’s meeting with Lukashenko, a close ally of Putin, is seen internationally as a sign of where China’s sympathies lie. Last week China’s foreign minister, Qin Gang, told his Belarusian counterpart that China would support Belarus in opposing any “illegal” sanctions on Minsk. China has not responded to calls from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to have a meeting with Xi to discuss China’s proposals. In the coming months, Xi is expected to visit Putin in Moscow."

                    "bodyText": "Ukraine’s ministry of defence claimed in total to have shot down 11 of 14 drones deployed overnight, including nine over Kyiv. Two emergency service workers were killed and three other people injured during a drone attack on Khmelnytskyi, according to the city’s mayor. Russian forces have escalated shelling and infantry assaults in the Bilohorivka, Svatove-Kupiansk and Kreminna areas of Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk province, according to the region’s Ukrainian governor Serhiy Haidai. “Western offensive heavy equipment is on the way and therefore in any week the military command can conduct an operation following the same plan as they did in the Kharkiv region,” Haidai said. Belarusian anti-war partisans claim to have severely damaged a Russian military aircraft in what an opposition leader has called the “most successful diversion” since the beginning of the war. BYPOL, the Belarusian partisan organisation, said it had used drones to strike the Machulishchy airfield 12km from Minsk, severely damaging a Beriev A-50 airborne early warning and control aircraft (Awacs). The damage to the aircraft has not been independently confirmed, although both Russian and Belarusian military bloggers have reported explosions on Sunday at the airfield. One also confirmed “damage to a Russian military transport plane”. Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said on Monday that talks with Sweden and Finland regarding their Nato membership bids would resume on 9 March, after a delay in January in the wake of a Qur’an-burning protest. The meeting will take place in Brussels and will include discussion on the implementation of the memorandum signed between the countries. It later emerged that the Qur’an-burning incident in Stockholm was funded by a far-right journalist with links to Kremlin-backed media. Respect for human rights has gone into reverse, the United Nations chief warned Monday, calling for a renewal of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 75 years after its signing. Pointing to the war raging in Ukraine, and threats to rights from soaring poverty, hunger and climate disasters, António Guterres said the declaration was “under assault from all sides”. He said the “Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered the most massive violations of human rights” being witnessed in the world today. “It has unleashed widespread death, destruction and displacement,” he said. The UK’s ministry of defence has claimed that “Russia will likely be concerned that unexplained explosions are occurring” in and around Mariupol, a location “at least 80km away from the frontline … [which] it had probably previously assessed as beyond the range of routine Ukrainian strike capabilities.” The US is “confident” that China is considering providing lethal equipment to support Russia in Ukraine, according to the CIA director, William Burns. In an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday, Burns said he was “confident that the Chinese leadership is considering the provision of lethal equipment” but noted “we also don’t see that a final decision has been made yet, and we don’t see evidence of actual shipments of lethal equipment”. China has always maintained communication with all sides in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including Kyiv, a foreign ministry spokesperson told a regular news briefing on Monday. Russia is paying “a great deal of attention” to China’s peace plan to end Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and its details will need to be analysed in detail, the Kremlin has said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said any initiatives that might bring peace closer were worthy of attention, but that Russia was continuing to prosecute its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine and that, for now, he didn’t see any signs suggesting a peaceful resolution could be achieved. Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev said in remarks published on Monday that the continued arms supply to Kyiv risks a global nuclear catastrophe, reiterating his threat of nuclear war over Ukraine. Medvedev’s apocalyptic rhetoric has been seen as an attempt to deter the US-led Nato military alliance and Kyiv’s western allies from getting even more involved in the war. Vladimir Putin has accused the west of seeking to “dismember” Russia and to turn the vast country into a series of weak mini-states. In an interview with the state TV channel Rossiya on Sunday, the Russian president claimed the US and its Nato allies wanted to “inflict a strategic defeat on us”. The aim, he said, was to “make our people suffer”. Putin has claimed Russia had no choice but to take into account the nuclear capabilities of Nato as the US-led military alliance was seeking the defeat of Russia. “In today’s conditions, when all the leading Nato countries have declared their main goal as inflicting a strategic defeat on us, so that our people suffer as they say, how can we ignore their nuclear capabilities in these conditions?” Putin told Rossiya 1 state television, according to Tass. “They tried to reshape the world exclusively on their terms. We had no choice but to react,” he said, adding that the west was complicit in Ukraine’s “crimes”. Gleb Pavlovsky, a Russian political scientist and Vladimir Putin’s former adviser who later became one of his most prominent critics, has died at the age of 71, according to local reports."

                    "bodyText": "“Every galah in the pet shop is talking about a capability gap”, former defence secretary Dennis Richardson memorably said. Those “galahs” include defence experts, policymakers and industry, who are all fretting about whether Australia will be left vulnerable when the ageing Collins class submarines are retired. The federal government is considering the defence strategic review and advice from the submarine taskforce on acquiring a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, but there are concerns that they will not be in service in time for a seamless handover from the Collins class. The defence minister, Richard Marles, has been sounding increasingly positive that there will be no such gap. “I’m feeling confident about our ability to deal with this,” he told Guardian Australia in January, adding it would be part of “the optimal pathway” to be announced soon. Marles said the government had asked the taskforce to examine “to the extent any capability gap arose how we would meet the capability gap”. “The process has been very focused on that, and I’m confident I’ll have answers to it.” While much of the focus is on submarines, though, experts say a multi-pronged approach could work. Acquiring that fleet of at least eight nuclear-powered submarines is the first “pillar” of the Aukus partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, but the second pillar, which includes hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence and underwater drones, will be needed in the short term. It will be at least a decade before even the first submarine is delivered and some estimates even push the timeline out to 2050. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is expected to meet with both the US president, Joe Biden, and the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in the US in March, to announce the governments’ plans. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Marles has emphasised the “genuinely trilateral” nature of the Aukus agreement between the three countries, leading to speculation a new hybrid submarine to replace the ageing Colins class fleet will be built using elements of both the US and the UK’s boats. The life of the Collins fleet will be stretched out as much as possible with life-of-type extensions, but the boats are still set to be retired by the end of the next decade. Marles told the ABC late last year that the Labor government had “inherited” a situation where the first submarine would not be in the water until the 2040s. “We need to be looking at how we can get that sooner,” he said. When former prime minister Scott Morrison announced he was scrapping the deal with France to build 12 boats in favour of the Aukus deal to build “at least” eight submarines in South Australia in 2021, he also announced plans to acquire various missiles, including hypersonic and precision strike guided missiles over the next decade. On top of the missiles, there is a second pillar of Aukus that includes working with the UK and the UK on underwater drones, quantum technology, artificial intelligence and autonomous technology, advanced cyber capabilities, electronic warfare, and other innovations. Those technologies are expected to help Australia in the context of increasing aggression from China while it waits for the submarines. Earlier this year, US senators warned Biden not to sell Australia any submarines, arguing the US did not have the industrial capability to spare any, which dashed hopes of getting any of those submarines earlier. Foreign policy and defence research fellow at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre, Tom Corben, said that “wouldn’t be news” to policymakers in the US or Australia. “When congressmen or senior leaders in the US say the shipbuilding base is maxed out, they’re not lying,” he said. “It’s been like that for a number of years now.” He said Marles had made it clear the project would be trilateral, which suggests Australia will not rely on the US and that instead the work would be split between nations. Corben said there could be “really creative solutions” found, but that it was important to remember the submarines are only one part of Aukus. “They’re pillar one of two pillars,” he said. While submarines are the “backbone” of the maritime force structure, Corben said he wouldn’t be surprised if the imminent announcement also contained more details on the second pillar. “Marles has emphasised that Australia is particularly interested in any capability through pillar two that would arrive in the next five years,” he said. “We’re in a bit of a dangerous window of time in terms of our collective ability to resist Chinese military incursion. The submarines won’t really help in that window, they’re more of a long-term [proposition]. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there is more detail on the other elements that are going to be required.” In a statement last year, the White House said the Aukus partners had made “strong progress” on the advanced capabilities. Trials of autonomous vehicles are set to begin this year, it said, and trials of quantum technologies for position, navigation and timing, would happen over the next three years. Work had already started on autonomous and artificial intelligence-enabled systems to improve the speed and precision of decision-making processes, while the three countries were also strengthening their defences against cyber-attacks, sharing information on electronic warfare, developing advanced hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities. The director of the Lowy Institute’s international security program, Sam Roggeveen, said there were other capabilities Australia could buy that could do “similar things” to submarines – such as sinking ships. “One area we’re already getting into is mine warfare,” he said. “But we’re also investing in anti-ship missiles that can be fired from the air and we’re even getting some land-based missile capability.” Other options that have been floated include building entirely new air warfare destroyers equipped with more than 100 missile launching cells, in order to bolster firepower, or building an interim conventional submarine. But Roggeveen warned that China’s anti-ship ballistic missiles made surface ships vulnerable. And Marles has appeared to dismiss the idea of interim submarines. “There are no plans for any conventional – conventionally powered interim submarine capability, as we move towards gaining the nuclear-powered submarine capability,” he said in January. In a statement to parliament on 9 Febuary, Marles emphasised the importance of the second pillar. “These capabilities will help us hold potential adversaries’ forces at risk, at a greater distance and increase the cost of aggression against Australia and its interests.”"

                    "headline": "Belarus partisans say they blew up Russian plane near Minsk",
                    "bodyText": "Belarusian anti-war partisans claim to have severely damaged a Russian military aircraft in what an opposition leader has called the “most successful diversion” since the beginning of the war. BYPOL, the Belarusian partisan organisation, said it had used drones to strike the Machulishchy airfield 12km from Minsk, severely damaging a Beriev A-50 airborne early warning and control aircraft (Awacs). “One of the nine Awacs of the Russian aerospace forces worth $330m (was destroyed),” the group said. “These were drones. The participants of the operation are Belarusians. (They have attained) ‘Victory’ and are now safely outside the country. Everyone has escaped.” The plane “definitely won’t fly anywhere”, it added. According to some reports, the aircraft was hit by munitions dropped by two drones. A second munition reportedly hit close to the cockpit. “The front and middle section of the aircraft were damaged, as well as avionics and a radar antenna,” said a report attributed to BYPOL. The damage to the aircraft has not been independently confirmed, although both Russian and Belarusian military bloggers have reported explosions on Sunday at the airfield. One also confirmed “damage to a Russian military transport plane”. “This is the most successful diversion since the beginning of 2022,” wrote Franak Viačorka, an adviser to the Belarusian opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsihanouskaya. “Two Belarusians conducted the operation. They used drones for this operation and have already left the country and are in safety now.” Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesperson, declined to comment on reports of the attack on Monday. “We have nothing to say about this,” he told journalists on Monday. The Beriev A50 represents old technology, built around the air frame of an Ilyushin transport plane. While first coming into service in the mid-1980s, it is also still a key military technology. With about 40 of the aircraft built – and nine reportedly still in active service – they are able to detect when air defence systems are activated and where, allowing Russia to target those air defences. More broadly, such so-called airborne early warning and control aircraft are used to detect aircraft, shipping, missiles, and other incoming projectiles at long ranges, surveil the battlefield and help with battlefield management. What is concerning for Moscow is that the airbase has also been hosting at least one MIG-31 interceptor, which is capable of carrying a nuclear capable hypersonic missile, aircraft whose launches have been responsible of a number of recent air alarms in Ukraine. Belarusian opposition forces have previously used drones to strike government targets. As early as 2021, the Black Stork group used drones to drop incendiary devices on riot police headquarters and other government buildings. Belarusian cyber-partisans have also been fighting the government since the 2020 protests against the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko. In 2022, members of the group told the Guardian they had hacked the Belarusian railways to disrupt Russia’s military buildup near Ukraine. “We don’t want Russian soldiers in Belarus since it compromises the sovereignty of the country and puts it in danger of occupation,” the member of the Cyberpartisans told the Guardian. “It also pulls Belarus into a war with Ukraine. And probably Belarusian soldiers would have to participate in it and die for this meaningless war.” Lukashenko announced on Monday that Moscow had delivered more weapons systems to the country, including an Iskander short-range ballistic missile system and an S-400 air-defence missile system. He said the Iskander missile system was delivered with the “relevant stock of missiles”, without further details. Belarus first claimed it had “autonomous” control of Iskander missile systems, which could reach targets in Ukraine or Poland, as of late last year. “An S-400 long-range air-defence missile system has also been delivered. This is what you, the military, wanted and what you received. It is a serious weapon,” Lukashenko said, according to comments published in state-run media."

                    "headline": "Some politicians seem comfortable with the idea of a new cold war. They shouldn’t",
                    "bodyText": "Events surrounding the first year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine have had a cold war-esque feel, with America and its allies lined up on one side and China and Russia on the other. Some politicians in Washington – and perhaps Beijing – seem comfortable with this. But they should be careful. There’s no reason to believe a cold war re-run in the 21st century would turn out well for anyone, above all the US. This past week, President Biden paid a dramatic visit to Kyiv and then addressed a crowd in Warsaw, pledging unwavering US support for Ukraine. President Putin gave a speech of his own in which he stubbornly insisted that Nato was to blame for the war and suspended Russia’s participation in a vital nuclear arms control treaty. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, meanwhile confronted his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in Munich, warning China not to supply Russia with weapons. Yi then flew to Moscow and stood alongside President Putin for a photo opportunity. Dangerous currents are carrying us toward a new, and very different, cold war. This time, China and Russia would be pitted against a US-led coalition of European and close Indo-Pacific allies like Japan, South Korea and Australia. The Biden administration, and some of their Chinese counterparts, probably hope to steer out of these currents, but it’s getting harder and harder. This week’s events come against the backdrop of the crackup over China’s spy balloon, an ongoing US-China trade and technology war, and several years of deteriorating diplomatic relations between Washington and both Beijing and Moscow. Time is not on the side of those who favor detente. In Washington, the US political system seems to be priming itself for a new cold war. Some Republican leaders, for example, are keen to use nostalgia for Ronald Reagan to unite their divided party and conjure up the memory of a prouder era in the party’s foreign policy, one before the messiness of the George W Bush and Trump years. Tellingly, Representative Mike Gallagher, who chairs the new House select committee on China, has made explicit his belief that the cold war should guide US policy toward China. Anti-China rhetoric also plays well with a Republican party that now draws many votes from lower income, predominantly white areas, where people are down on their luck and ready to blame the Chinese for their hardships. This helps drive Republican arguments for “decoupling” the US and Chinese economies, recognizing Taiwan’s independence, and other measures that needlessly intensify the clash with Beijing. Democrats, who are already angered by China’s poor human rights record and vocal support for Putin, are reacting with more aggressive positions of their own. Beijing’s impatient nationalism, military expansionism, and irascible diplomacy is obviously not helping. The prospect that Chinese leaders were seriously considering providing lethal assistance to Russia – as Blinken charged in Munich – is especially worrisome because it indicates that Beijing may not fully understand how deep the pool of animosity against it is in America today. Whether or not China’s autocratic leaders grasp the role of public opinion in US foreign policy is uncertain. Superficially, a return to the bipolarity of the old east-west standoff might seem advantageous for the west. After all, the free world won the last time, and despite the Strangelovean gloom, avoided nuclear war. The cold war also had the advantage of simplifying things. At least we knew who the enemy was. It also helped keep a lid on some of the major security problems that have menaced the world since, such as failed states, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. But a mid-21st-century cold war would be very different from its 20th-century precursor. To begin with, it is too easy to forget that American economic power then outstripped the Soviets three times over. In contrast, the Chinese economy now rivals America’s. During the cold war America was able to use its huge economic advantage to spend heavily on defense while simultaneously building a social welfare system that soothed the inevitable strains of the liberal system. In a new cold war, America and its allies might hope their liberal economic and political model will give them the technological and economic edge that would make this possible, but China is not a command economy like the Soviet Union and will almost certainly be far more successful economically. In the last century, the onset of the cold war also required no process of economic decoupling. But this time around, the dislocations of economic decoupling would almost certainly cause domestic political volatility. This would make both sides’ foreign policies more unpredictable, and probably more belligerent. Meanwhile, America would have to finance an arms buildup not just in Europe, but also in Asia. This would create an even heavier fiscal burden in America, hence higher taxes and more inflationary pressure. If China divested from its massive dollar holdings, which seems likely, the fiscal situation would get even worse. Yet another difference is that many US allies would struggle to pay their own defense bills and still maintain economic separation from China. In fact, they might not even want to. Whereas Soviet ideology called for an overthrow of their liberal political systems and the appropriation of bourgeois property, China’s ideology today poses no such threat. Especially in the early years of a new cold war, the risk of an accidental war would be high. Early cold war crisis, for example over Berlin in 1948, almost led to war before cooler heads prevailed. There is no guarantee that a crisis today would also be resolved peaceably. Both sides’ uncertainty about military redlines and capabilities would increase the chance of misunderstandings and create incentives to take military risks, especially if communication has broken down. In this environment, defensive military measures aimed at preventing war could accidentally bring it on. The costs of war would be devastating: even conservative estimates of a standoff over Taiwan point to trillions of dollars in losses. The United States and the Soviet Union managed to avoid global thermonuclear war in the 20th century, but this shouldn’t lull us into overconfidence about what might happen in the future. The 20th-century world had more than one brush with fate, for example, during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and the 1983 Nato “Able Archer” exercise. Creating strategic stability – a situation in which neither side has an incentive to start a nuclear war – is already going to be complicated enough in a world where China and Russia are both likely to have superpower-sized nuclear arsenals. The political and security competition of a new cold war could make it impossible. Sometimes confrontation between world powers is necessary. It can even be constructive. But I doubt that the Biden administration is happy about the trend toward a new bipolar standoff and hope that Beijing is more concerned than it lets on. The cold war may be the model of great power competition that Washington is most comfortable with, but it’s a dangerously misleading one and should be resisted.

Here’s a summary of the main news developments: A court has ordered the parent company behind failed recycling scheme REDcycle be wound up following the discovery of tonnes of stockpiled plastic. The Optus and Medibank incidents have exposed “gaps” in Australia’s existing incident response functions, according to a discussion paper released this afternoon. The paper was released shortly after Anthony Albanese addressed the cybersecurity roundtable in Sydney, in which plans for a new national cybersecurity coordinator were announced. Malka Leifer, a former principal of Adass Israel school in Elsternwick, arranged for a student to meet her in another teacher’s office that had no windows and a lockable door before abusing her, a court has heard. Queensland’s First Nations children experiencing domestic and family violence are being harmed – and funnelled into risk-taking and criminal behaviour – by failures in the child protection, youth justice and other support systems, a landmark report has found. Woodside faces more challenges of its climate stance at its upcoming shareholders gathering with activist groups dismissing its latest annual report as a “fail”. The energy giant on Monday released its climate report 2022 while also revealing its underlying profit had more than tripled to US$5.2bn ($7.7bn). The former New South Wales deputy premier John Barilaro “inappropriately interfered” in the selection of former NSW Business Chamber chief executive Stephen Cartwright to fill a senior UK trade position for the state government, a parliamentary inquiry has found. Constable Zachary Rolfe may have made an “attempt to pervert the course of justice” in writing an open letter about his conduct, and media outlets that published it could be investigated for contempt, according to explosive evidence given to a coronial inquest. Tasmania’s largest salmon company, Tassal, sought to block the release of monitoring reports submitted to the state’s Environment Protection Agency (EPA) after using more than two tonnes of antibiotics at two of its fish farms. A Queensland watch-house whistleblower says he witnessed “illegal” strip searches of children, a girl placed in a cell with adult men, and staff wrapping towels around prisoners’ heads to avoid spit hood protocols, causing them to “feel waterboarded”. Australia’s renters are facing “staggering” increases in weekly costs, with worsening shortages of homes pushing up rents by a third or more in the past year in the most stretched markets. Thanks for tuning in, we’ll be back tomorrow to do it all over again. Have a pleasant evening. Australian startup Recharge finalises deal to take over UK battery maker Britishvolt The Australia-based company Recharge Industries will take over collapsed battery maker Britishvolt after finalising a deal with administrators late on Sunday in the UK. The agreement revives hopes for the construction of a £3.8bn (A$6.7bn) “gigafactory” in northern England, the backbone of a plan to modernise the British automotive industry and supply the next generation of UK-built electric vehicles. The deal was finalised three weeks after Recharge, an Australian company that sits under New York-based investment firm Scale Facilitation, was nominated as preferred bidder, placing a huge opportunity, and burden, on a startup yet to construct a project. Scale Facilitation’s Australian-born founder and chief executive, David Collard, told the Guardian the factory and an associated supplier park, where components are manufactured, were still a focus. “We’re working closely with one of the leading UK fund managers looking to team [up] on the development,” Collard said. Read more: Snow in LA, baguettes and a cup final: the weekend’s best photos The Guardian’s picture editors select photo highlights from around the world Little sign of a pullback in profits in December quarter, ABS data shows We’ll get December quarter and full-year GDP figures this Wednesday, but most of the pieces of the puzzle are already in. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported some of the key business indicators for the quarter, including a surprising 10.6% jump, seasonally adjusted, in company profits. Wages and salaries, by contrast, rose a more modest 2.6%. Westpac, for instance, had tipped profits to rise only 1%, while the market “consensus” was for a 1.8% increase. The profit surge is likely to bolster the case to look at whether companies pushing through higher prices than the underlying cost of inputs (such as labour) might be the real source of inflationary pressure. The Australia Institute is among the groups that reckon so, as we saw last week: The spread of profit, as you might expect, varies by industry. The real estate industry, where property sales and prices have been on the skids, was the lagging sector in the December quarter. Given the way interest rates are headed, this trend might well persist. Inventories, meanwhile, sank 0.2% in the quarter. Sounds a bit dull, but the shift reversed a 0.4 percentage point rise in the September quarter, and the shift alone will lop off 0.8 percentage points of GDP growth for the final three months of 2022. Foreign trade figures out tomorrow from the ABS will provide the last of the GDP figures that economists need to update their forecasts for what Wednesday’s numbers should look like. Delegation of vice-chancellors to join education minister on India visit A dozen vice-chancellors are joining education minister Jason Clare on an official visit to India this week, as the federal government moves to strengthen its ties with the nation’s tertiary sector. On the five-day visit, Clare will sign a mutual recognition agreement for qualifications with India, while Universities Australia (UA) will also renew its formal partnership with the Association of Indian universities. Clare has raised the possibility of establishing Australian campuses in India to capitalise on India’s goal to educate 500 million students by 2035 under its national education plan. UA said education would be key to a growing trade relationship with India, currently Australia’s second largest and fastest growing source of international students after China. There are around 128,979 Indian students enrolled with Australian providers, representing 17% of the entire makeup. CEO of UA Catriona Jackson will accompany the prime minister on a visit to India following Clare. She said universities “fully support” the federal government’s commitment to sign the agreement. Higher education and research are central pillars of our relationship, and universities are eager to use the opportunities in front of us to ratchet up our engagement ... we are entering a golden era in our education relationship with India. We must make the most of it for the benefit of both our nations. Australian Technology Network of Universities (ATN) executive director, Luke Sheehy is among the delegation. In semester one of 2022, there was a 275% increase on Indian enrolments at ATN universities. This delegation will help solidify the already deep affinity we share. There is an enduring genuine affection with India, along with great partnerships which have been signed in economic agreements, and education has always taken a leading role. It follows the resignation of 13 academic fellows last year from the Australia India Institute – Australia’s leading India thinktank – over concerns about academic freedom, as reported by the Saturday Paper. Leifer allegedly abused student in another teacher’s windowless office, court told Malka Leifer, a former principal of Adass Israel school in Elsternwick, arranged for a student to meet her in another teacher’s office that had no windows and a lockable door before abusing her, a court has heard. Leifer has been charged with 29 offences against three sisters between 2003 and 2007, including 10 counts of rape. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is facing trial at the county court in Melbourne. Dr Vicki Gordon, a clinical and forensic psychologist who treated one of Leifer’s alleged victims, told the court on Monday about the notes she had taken after an appointment in March 2008. During the session, Gordon said the woman had been “full of shame” and would send her text messages regarding the alleged abuse committed by Leifer while sitting across from her “because she couldn’t mouth the words. She was too embarrassed”.

The inquest into the shooting death of Warlpiri teenager Kumanjayi Walker resumed on Monday. Walker, 19, was shot dead by Rolfe during a botched arrest in the remote Northern Territory community of Yuendumu in 2019. Rolfe was cleared of all criminal charges in relation to the shooting. He has been pursuing legal action to avoid giving evidence at the inquest, and wrote an open letter before leaving the country late last week. Rolfe said in a 2,500-word statement published on Facebook that he was a “good cop” who “loved the job”, but that he had been “painted” as racist and violent. Acting for the NT police, Ian Freckleton SC on Monday said the force was “extremely concerned” about Rolfe’s conduct.

Mark Gladman, a former deputy general counsel at the Department of Human Services, told the commission that after researching the scheme he believed it was “weak”. Gladman said he advised his superior at the time, acting chief counsel Lisa Carmody, that the department should seek the Australian government solicitor’s (AGS) opinion on the program. The inquiry was shown draft instructions that Gladman and colleagues had prepared for the AGS. As it turned out, the AGS didn’t end up providing a legal opinion until late March 2019, more than two years later. It said then the scheme was likely unlawful. Carmody, who was acting in the role in early January, told the commission on Monday she had brief discussions with the AGS before her usual boss, Annette Musolino resumed in the role. Carmody said she also provided hard copies of the documents – including Gladman’s teams draft advice on the scheme – to Musolino when she returned from leave in January 2017. Musolino is expected to appear again at the royal commission. Carmody agreed the draft advice – which sought to mount a legal defence for the scheme – was “unconvincing”. The advice was never finalised. The inquiry before Catherine Holmes AC SC continues. Qantas announces leadership changes Andrew David, the chief executive of Qantas Domestic and International, will retire from the company in September, as the airline announces changes to its leadership structure. Less than a week after announcing a record $1.43bn half-year profit, Qantas on Monday announced that ahead of David’s departure, his role – which was combined during Covid – will again be split into two portfolios for domestic and international. From July, former Air New Zealand executive Cameron Wallace will take over as chief executive of Qantas International. David will remain as chief executive of Qantas Domestic until his retirement in September. “This will provide the management bandwidth required as each business welcomes new aircraft and expands its network,” Qantas said in a statement. Both the roles will report to the chief executive of the broader Qantas Group, Alan Joyce, who himself is expected to leave Qantas later this year. NZ to stage global fundraiser to support Cyclone Gabrielle recovery New Zealand will stage an international fundraising appeal to support its Cyclone Gabrielle recovery, and a one-off lotto draw next month. Prime minister Chris Hipkins said the appeal was modelled off a similar fundraising effort following the 2011 Christchurch earthquakes, which raised more than $NZ94m ($A86m). This global appeal means we can harness local and international donations and channel them to the communities and projects that need them the most. The cyclone was NZ’s biggest storm in a generation, affecting one-third of its land mass and causing billions of dollars worth of damage. The final bill may never be known, but includes huge rebuilds of road, rail and energy infrastructure, as well as housing, and lost earnings from vast swathes of agricultural land. Hipkins said he hoped Kiwis in the one million strong diaspora – which includes hundreds of thousands in Australia – would consider giving. New Zealanders who have gone abroad and done well and want to get something back to the country, my message to them is ‘We would love your support’. Businesses that have a relationship with New Zealand and want to chip in and help out with the rebuild, again, we would love to hear from them as well … This is a charitable appeal. So we’re really targeting anyone who’s in a position to feel that they can contribute and do something that’s for the wider community. Gabrielle’s death toll remains at 11. Earlier fears of a much larger toll are subsiding, with police revealing they had whittled down the number of missing people from almost 7,000 to five. Of the outstanding people, three are on active charges, including two who breached bail prior to the cyclone. – AAP Thanks for your attention this Monday, Elias Visontay will take you through the rest of today’s news. Young girl in critical condition after falling from rocks in Queensland A young girl is in critical condition after falling from rocks at North Stradbroke Island on Saturday. News.com.au is reporting the eight-year-old girl fell from the lookout on the island: Her father jumped in after her and found her unconscious, holding her head above water as they waited for help. It is believed she was swept off the rocks and under water for a period of time. Queensland Ambulance Service have told Guardian Australia two patients were assessed “following a post immersion incident” off South Gorge Beach shortly before 11.30am on 25 February. A female child was airlifted to Queensland Children’s Hospital in a critical condition and a male adult was transported by road to Murrie Rose centre and further transported to Princess Alexandra hospital stable. UN scolds Australia for its treatment of sick refugees Australia has copped a pasting from the United Nations for its treatment of asylum seekers who remain stuck in Nauru and Papua New Guinea, AAP reports. The UN high commissioner for refugees has joined human rights groups and grassroots advocates in demanding the immediate evacuation of about 150 people being held offshore. Greens senator Nick McKim has introduced proposed laws that would see 66 people on Nauru and another 92 in PNG transferred to community detention in Australia if they posed no security risk. People evacuated to Australia would be provided with access to medical treatment. A parliamentary inquiry investigating the bill has received more than 30 submissions, with unanimous support for the legislative amendment. The UNHCR and Human Rights Watch were among those to support a more humane and cost-effective approach to achieving “immigration enforcement goals”. The UN lambasted the government, saying it had a legal responsibility towards the safe settlement of asylum seekers under international rules. The agency said: The government of Australia cannot seek to divest itself of responsibility or limit jurisdiction and responsibility under international law for those taken to Nauru or Papua New Guinea. Its submission described observing first-hand how the physical and psychological health of asylum seekers and refugees transferred offshore by Australia had deteriorated over the last decade. Human Rights Watch said 12 asylum seekers had died since 2013, when the offshore processing policy was introduced. The organisation also pointed out Australian taxpayers had been left to pay the exorbitant bill. Salmon company Tassal tried to block release of report on antibiotic use, documents show Tasmania’s largest salmon company, Tassal, sought to block the release of monitoring reports submitted to the state’s Environment Protection Agency (EPA) after using more than two tonnes of antibiotics at two of its fish farms. In early January 2022, Tassal and Huon Aquaculture reported outbreaks of vibrio, a bacterium the Tasmanian Salmonid Growers Association says can cause an infection with a “high mortality rate”.

Labor announced the creation of three centres in the Hunter, Illawarra and western Sydney at a cost of $42m to form the vocational backbone needed to build trains, buses and ferries. Labor leader Chris Minns told reporters at Lake Macquarie today: There is a proud tradition of train building in the Hunter. It’s been happening in this region for over 100 years and I firmly believe that Australians are world leaders when it comes to engineering and manufacturing – they just need a government in this state that’s going to back local and buy local. We’re determined to change government policy to make sure that we can build trains right here in NSW. The opposition said 1,000 jobs building trains in the region would be created in its first term through Domestic Manufacturing Centres of Excellence, run by Tafe. Minns said relying on overseas contractors had blown the budget for the Liberal-National coalition government in the top six transport infrastructure projects by 40 to 50% and domestic manufacturing was needed to jump start the economy. Nothing will change unless there’s a change of government. We believe in domestic manufacturing and we’ve got the policies to back it up. Severe thunderstorm warning for northern NSW The NSW SES is issuing a severe thunderstorm warning for northern NSW including Grafton, Kempsey, Armidale, Tenterfield, Glen Innes and Dorrigo. These areas could also see damaging winds and large hailstones. If you’re in those areas, stay safe! Indian students facing lengthy visa delays Indian students with Australian PhD placements facing lengthy student visa delays are urging the federal government to clear a backlog as the education minister signs a broad-ranging tertiary education deal. Atul Kumar Rai is in a WhatsApp group with more than 100 students who’ve been awarded fully funded PhD scholarships at Australian universities and are still waiting for visa outcomes – some for up to three years. Rai lodged his visa application in March 2022 after receiving a fully-funded scholarship at the University of Wollongong. He has received a common response when reaching out to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection: Unfortunately, ensuring all the legal requirements are met in relation to an application can take some time. In particular, it can take several months to obtain any necessary health, character and security clearances from other agencies ... I am unable to provide you with a definitive timeframe for the finalisation of your application. Rai said during this time, he had submitted $3,500 for health insurance and visa application fees. This week, minister for education Jason Clare is visiting India to sign deepened agreements for mutual recognition in the higher education sector. Rai questioned why higher education pathways were being fostered when students were having their scholarships lapse. Delaying the visas will be slowing down the growth and development of both countries. We are the brands of our country and educational institutions. We will play a very vital role in the exchange of knowledge, technology and culture of both countries. We don’t need relaxed working hours or post study visa relations. We just want our student visa. It feels like we are left behind. We have sleeping disorder, anxiety issues during this period. Parkarsh Kumar received multiple international PhD offers after graduating in Taiwan in 2021. He chose Australia for its reputation and the mutual relationship agreements between the two nations. My dream of becoming professor at a reputed Indian university is getting shattered after waiting for so long and yet no communication from the Department of Home Affairs. I am currently waiting for more than 14 months. A spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs said it understood visa application delays were causing concerns for students. One in ten student visas for postgraduate research aren’t being processed within 12 months, with delays cited if applications are “complex” or incomplete. Half of visas are finalised within four months. The Optus and Medibank incidents have exposed “gaps” in Australia’s existing incident response functions, according to a discussion paper released this afternoon. The discussion paper calls for regulatory changes – including potentially a new Cyber Security Act. Most controversially, the paper suggests that the government’s power to step in to assist organisations or companies respond to cyber attacks could be expanded to a wider range of circumstances. But it is worth pointing out that this is not government policy as yet. The discussion paper was released shortly after Anthony Albanese addressed the cybersecurity roundtable in Sydney. It was drafted by an expert advisory board chaired by former Telstra boss Andrew Penn and whose other members are former air force chief Mel Hupfeld and cyber security expert Rachael Falk. The authors say they have heard from industry that business owners “often do not feel their cybersecurity obligations are clear or easy to follow”. The paper says it is “clear from stakeholder feedback and the increasing frequency and severity of major cyber incidents, that more explicit specification of obligations, including some form of best practice cyber security standards, is required across the economy to increase our national cyber resilience and keep Australians and their data safe.” It adds: It is clear that a package of regulatory reform is necessary. How this would be implemented, including the potential consideration of a new Cyber Security Act, drawing together cyber-specific legislative obligations and standards across industry and government, and the details of these reforms is something on which feedback will be welcomed. This should also consider whether further developments to the [Security of Critical Infrastructure] Act are warranted, such as including customer data and ‘systems’ in the definition of critical assets to ensure the powers afforded to government under the SOCI Act extend to major data breaches such as those experienced by Medibank and Optus, not just operational disruptions.” That proposal would expand the circumstances where the Australian Signals Directorate could step in to “assist” in the response to a cyber attack. Other proposals for feedback include strengthening Australia’s international strategy on cyber security (such as boosting assistance to south-east Asian and Pacific countries). The paper also urges the government to lead by example, highlighting the fact that Australian government entities “have a long way to go to properly secure government systems”. It also suggests more help for small and medium businesses. Feedback is sought by 15 April. New coordinator for cybersecurity to be announced Albanese ends his speech announcing a new coordinator for cybersecurity will be appointed within the home affairs portfolio: We want all Australian businesses to be able to pick tech themselves but also protect their customers. And I don’t underestimate the challenge we are facing, this is an ever evolving threat and it will need adaptation from us and for business and for government to make sure we keep on top of this. That’s why today, as well as part of this process, we are announcing a coordinator for cybersecurity. We want that coordination to be done centrally so it’s most effective, that’s why that will be located in the Department of Home Affairs under the responsibility of minister Clare O’Neil, so there is a clear pathway forward, and I believe that is a critical contribution that we can make. Albanese goes on to say the government is determined to turn around a situation where Australia has been “off the pace” for too many years when it comes to the rapidly evolving cybersecurity threat. We, of course are conscious as a government as well about state-sponsored attacks, which increasingly prevalent, stealing classified information, to cyber criminal acts aimed at seeking to secure some profit or in some cases, ransomeware attacks, which are increasingly prevalent as well. So, clearly as it stands government policies and regulations, business sectors systems and measures, and our general awareness of capacity as a nation are simply not at the level that we need them to be. …This is really fast moving. It’s a rapidly evolving threat and for too many years Australia has been off the pace. Our government is determined to change that. He tells the industry and experts at the roundtable: We want to use your expertise and experience to build a national cybersecurity strategy that is practical, that’s useful and adaptable. For every level of government, every branch of the public service every agency and institution, for business, large and small and for people. Albanese on strengthening national cybersecurity But back to Australian shores, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese is speaking about developing a national cybersecurity strategy at the roundtable taking place today in Sydney. Albanese opens his speech reflecting on the importance of cybersecurity not only for Australian business and national security but also the importance for individuals to feel their identity is protected. Cybersecurity is national security, it is business security but it is also personal security for 25 million Australians. … Strengthening Australia’s cybersecurity is a fundamental priority for our government. We recognise it is an essential part of life, the way that every Australian and every business and every community organisation deals with each other, on a day-to-day basis. It is absolutely critical as well for maintaining trust in our public institutions, and our public service. It’s critical to maintain confidence in your commercial dealings, and also in your intellectual property, which is often the foundation of your wealth creation. It’s also vital to individuals, individuals quite rightly feel violated when their details are online. It is no different from someone breaking into your house and stealing something from you because it is your property, and in some cases it’s your identity as well. It’s currently Sunday night in Los Angeles where the Screen Actors Guild awards are taking place with nominees stepping out onto the red carpet now ahead of the ceremony. Australia’s own Cate Blanchett, nominated for her leading role in Tar, is impressing in a sparkling black Armani Privé gown in her march towards the Oscars. A NSW parliamentary committee has accused premier Dominic Perrottet of hindering its probe into lucrative overseas trade roles, AAP reports. The committee said in its final report released today: The premier’s refusal to assist this inquiry in its investigations has impeded the committee’s ability to determine his role in the selection of Stephen Cartwright as the NSW Agent General UK, as well as determining his remuneration. The inquiry was launched to investigate former NSW deputy premier John Barilaro’s appointment to a taxpayer-funded US trade position and was later expanded to examine similar lucrative roles, including that of Cartwright. The upper house committee report found Barilaro interfered in that hiring process by meeting with Cartwright, and failed to engage with a candidate who had previously been preferred for the job. Barilaro also talked with Cartwright about his salary expectations, boosting his expectations. The committee report said this was highly inappropriate and showed poor judgment. Cartwright, who eventually landed an annual pay packet of $600,000 along with a $105,000 rent allowance, applied pressure to public servants during negotiations, the committee found. The premier dismissed the report’s findings and denied Barilaro had acted inappropriately. He told reporters today: This is typical of Labor, back in the upper house playing more games. The premier cited independent reports commissioned by the government. Wong to take part in G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in New Delhi Wong will then travel on to India – the first time she has visited that country since being sworn in as foreign affairs minister last May. The main commitments are the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in New Delhi, and the strategic conference known as the Raisina Dialogue. The G20 has struggled to come to a unified position on the war in Ukraine. A statement issued after a meeting of the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors held in Bengaluru, India, on Friday and Saturday said that “most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine”. That statement which included language that “deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and demands its complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine” – was not agreed by G20 member countries Russia and China. Wong said today: I look forward to working with my counterparts on how we can address contemporary international challenges, including strengthening the multilateral system, food and energy security, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief … This year is an important milestone in Australia’s bilateral relationship with India, with many high-level ministerial visits between our two countries. Prime minister Anthony Albanese, minister for trade and tourism Don Farrell and minister for resources Madeleine King will travel to India over the next month, and later this year Australia looks forward to hosting Indian prime minister Narendra Modi when he attends the Quad leaders’ meeting. Wong to travel to India and Malaysia this week Just days after returning from Kiribati and Fiji, Penny Wong will travel to Malaysia and India this week. Malaysia has previously expressed concerns that the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine plan could contribute to a regional arms race. Australia, the US and the UK are expected to announce the finer details of those submarine plans next month, so it seems likely this and the parallel defence strategic review could come up in discussions. The foreign affairs minister said she looked forward to holding introductory meetings with members of the new Malaysian government, including the prime minister, minister of foreign affairs and minister of economy. Wong said she would use the visit to Malaysia to “reaffirm our shared priorities” and to advance “our significant trade and economic links, cooperation on defence and regional security, and the close ties between our peoples”. Referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), Wong added: Australia is committed to working with Malaysia to support Asean’s vital contribution to regional peace and security. GPs call on other states to follow Queensland offering pill testing One of the nation’s peak doctors’ bodies has called on states and territories to introduce illicit pill testing to “save lives” after Queensland unveiled plans for a trial. The Queensland government on Saturday announced plans to have at least one drug-checking trial site running within six months in a bid to reduce avoidable deaths. The move comes days after the state government tabled legislation aimed at decriminalising illicit drug possession and five years after drug checking was first trialled at a Canberra music festival. Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) has backed the pill-testing plan, calling on other state and territory leaders to do so to “save lives”. RACGP president Dr Nicole Higgins says people will take illicit drugs despite the risks so governments should try to minimise harm, “not stick our heads in the sand and pretend otherwise”. She said in a statement today: From what has occurred in other jurisdictions, we know that many people who submit drugs for testing don’t take them when they find out what they actually contain. Prevention is better than punitive action. A ‘war on drugs’ mindset gets us nowhere. I call on our nation’s leaders to follow the lead of the ACT and now Queensland and introduce fixed and mobile pill-testing sites to save lives. However, Queensland opposition health spokeswoman Ros Bates, a registered nurse, said the move to allow pill testing was “soft on drugs” and pointed to a suggestion from NSW police that pill testing gave users false confidence about safety. Victoria and NSW have resisted pushes to roll out approved testing sites despite multiple coronial inquests into drug-related festival deaths recommending the measure. – AAP As we’ve mentioned on the blog, Woodside is the latest corporation to be recording big profits, following similar boons for Qantas, CBA Woolworth and Coles posted last week. Guardian columnist Greg Jericho gives you a visual on just how much profits are soaring ahead of wages. The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions Sally McManus says the graph paints a picture of the continuing transfer of wealth to corporate Australia, causing “greedflation”. Flowers and a fruit tree have popped up out of a pothole in the town of Wallan north of Melbourne, along with a sign that reads “Wallan Botanical Gardens”. The Whittlesea Leader has appealed to their readers for information behind the unusual sight on the Northern Highway, with comments attesting to a collective frustration among the community at the lack of action to fix local roads. The issue of potholes have become particularly acute in towns like Wallan which were affected by last year’s east coast floods which ravaged roads and transport networks creating an infrastructure crisis. Overseas in France, where potholes are known as “nids-de-poule” (literally “hen’s nests”), frustration over the state of the country’s roads has also taken an ironic turn. The “Operation Hen’s Nest” campaign has been running by the French Federation of Angry Bikers (“La Fédération Française des Motards en Colère”) sets up mock hen’s nests in potholes, adding signs or writing on the roads to alert users to their presence. Woodside’s climate report falls short, activist groups says Along with its earnings (‘ka-ching’) report, energy giant Woodside has also released its latest annual climate statement, which is always a tricky issue when you’re a company based on digging up or drilling fossil fuels. Shareholders at last year’s annual general meeting came close to rejecting the company’s climate report for 2021, with only 51% approving it. Expect this year’s report to be back on the AGM voting list, with Greenpeace, Market Forces and the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility rejecting it to be a “fail”. The company states: Woodside aims to thrive through the energy transition by building a low-cost, lower carbon, profitable, resilient and diversified portfolio. (“Lower carbon”, according to Woodside, is based on a comparison against “historical and/or current conventions”.) Anyway, the company aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions of its scope 1 pollution (resulting from the production of gas and oil) by 15% by 2025, and 30% by 2030. To deal with emissions from users’ burning the fuel, the company has set aside $US5bn for “targeted investments in new energy products and lower carbon services by 2030”. Glenn Walker, head of Greenpeace Australia Pacific’s advocacy and strategy, said Woodside had made almost no progress on plans to reduce emissions, despite setting an “aspirational” net-zero goal by 2050. Walker said: Woodside’s Climate Report is a schoolboy effort, essentially a rehash of its previous year’s plan that betrays the company’s lack of genuine commitment to emissions reduction. Woodside is betting the farm on a fantasy future increase in gas use that is utterly at odds with modelling from credible energy analysts such as the International Energy Agency. The Woodside-led Burrup Hub gas project, which would release more than 6bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent pollution (or about 12 times Australia’s national emissions), is among the firm’s proposed projects. Will van de Pol, acting executive director of Market Forces, said Woodside’s plans were “incompatible with a net zero emissions by 2050 pathway”. Woodside continues to promote a strategy that undermines climate action by paying big executive bonuses for increasing oil and gas production and progressing new oil and gas projects,” van de Pol said, adding Market Forces urged investors to vote for the ‘Capital Protection’ shareholder resolution, vote against the company’s remuneration report and reject directors standing for reelection at the company’s AGM in April. Alex Hillman, ACCR’s lead analyst, said fossil fuel companies like Woodside might have made “huge profits” in 2022 but such windfall gains would likely prove “short-lived” as energy markets accelerate their shift towards renewables. Hillman said: Today, Woodside remains stubbornly rusted on to its underwhelming 2021 climate plan, saying its ‘strategy remains consistent’. Regardless of material investor concerns about the company’s overreliance on offsets, Woodside has confirmed it still plans to use offsets to meet 100% of its restated scope 1 emission reduction target. Woodside’s directors have a tin ear on climate risk and it’s time they were called to account. April, it seems, would be the occasion for such an accounting, if there is to be one. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet has called for the end of broad Covid-19 vaccine mandates in his state, saying the jab has no effect on transmission. Public health orders mandating vaccines for health professionals expired in November but some workplaces can require mandatory vaccination under their own applicable work, health and safety obligations. Perrottet told Sydney radio 2GB this morning: There is no evidence that vaccines in the current environment have any impact at all on transmission of Covid. I could not be clearer. He said health facilities imposed some vaccine requirements on workers before the pandemic, usually for influenza, and that was the point he wanted to get back to. In the areas of the public service that I can make that direction, I have it and it has been enacted. I’ve also worked very closely with the private sector who have followed my position. According to the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance [NCIRS], Covid-19 vaccines are effective in preventing severe disease but are not as effective in preventing transmission. NCIRS advice states: The Covid-19 vaccines were designed to protect individuals from Covid-19 and severe disease. Like most vaccines, they were not designed to reduce transmission. Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) recommends adults get a vaccine booster if they haven’t been vaccinated or caught the virus in the past six months, and are either over 65 or have medical comorbidities that increase their risk of severe Covid-19. – with AAP Former Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham has switched parties in the hope of re-entering NSW parliament for the Legalise Cannabis party, AAP reports. The party maintains the criminalisation of cannabis use and possession are both ineffective and unfair, and have a disproportionate impact on sick, young and Indigenous people. Also running on the party’s ticket is former Australian Idol host James Mathison. The party is confident after having two upper house MPs elected in the most recent Victorian and Western Australian elections. Buckingham told AAP: We think there’s a good chance [and] we’re going to run a positive campaign. The majority of Australians now support legalisation. Medicinal cannabis use is growing across NSW, with close to 500,000 people using the drug nationally. Buckingham – previously an MLC for the NSW Greens – resigned from the party in 2018, saying it had become a “toxic” organisation which had “abandoned the core principles they were founded on”. His resignation came after months of infighting and pressure from his parliamentary colleagues. Despite his controversial exit, Buckingham said he was ready to return to the political fray. I’ve still got a lot of friends in the environmental movement. I’ll be happy to work with the Greens to get cannabis law reform over the line. If elected, the party will push to make cannabis legal for adults and to change road rules the party says discriminate against users. It also wants criminal records for prior cannabis offences to be expunged. Severe thunderstorms predicted for the Hunter in NSW The Bureau of Meteorology is predicting severe thunderstorms for the eastern ranges and coastal hinterland of NSW this afternoon and evening. They said the Hunter region is facing the highest risk, with the possibility of destructive winds and giant hailstones as well as severe thunder. A court has ordered failed recycling scheme REDcycle be wound up following the discovery of tonnes of stockpiled plastic, AAP reports. NSW supreme court registrar Leonie Walton ordered the scheme’s parent company RG Programs and Services be wound up today, appointing Benjamin Carson of Farnsworth Carson as liquidator. Supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths were partners in the scheme and on Friday offered to take back the plastic until it can be “viably processed for recycling”. The two companies say they paid $20m to REDcycle over a decade and were not told about the stockpiling. The scheme abruptly stopped operating in November and has since admitted to stockpiling more than 12,000 tonnes of plastic in NSW, Victoria and South Australia. REDcycle has previously denied the stockpiling was a cover-up, saying it was an attempt to ride out problems including a spike in returned plastics, a fire at its largest taker of the material and insufficient recycling capabilities in Australia. Supporting creditors will have to chase their own costs. Walton said: [It’s] their choice to be here – up to them to take it up with the liquidator. Australia’s biggest gas and oil company Woodside has done very nicely out of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, reporting today a full-year net profit after tax of $US6.5bn (or A$9.7bn). That was up 228% on a year earlier, and includes the proceeds of its takeover of BHP’s oil assets. The main profit driver, though, was soaring global energy prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a year earlier. The disruptions and subsequent sanctions on Russian energy helped push up the “realised price” of Woodside’s production 63% to the equivalent of $US98.40 per barrel of oil. The market watches most closely the so-called underlying profit, which also rose 223% – or more than triple – to $US5.2bn. Investors were also keen on the dividend payout, which for the full year were $2.53 a share or 87% higher than the previous year. Woodside as one of the big gas producers has been unhappy about the Albanese government’s invention to place a price cap of $12/gigajoule for domestic supply. Increasingly, though, the worry is what the ACCC is coming to come up with in terms of a mandatory code of conduct, reviews of prices and a “reasonable” price test for future developments. To that end, the company was keen to state its payments in taxes and royalties had more than tripled in the past year to $A2.7bn. Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill said in a statement accompanying today’s results: [O]ur tax payments are expected to again increase significantly in 2023. Investors at least seem cheered by the numbers, with Woodside’s share price recently up about 2.5% to $35.47. The gain was in stark contrast to overall market’s drop of about 1% on concerns about higher inflation – and higher borrowing costs – in the US. Melbourne restaurant changes dress code after turning away Russell Crowe A high-end Japanese restaurant in Melbourne, Mr Miyagi, has changed its dress code after staff turned away Russell Crowe last week. Owner Kristian Klein told the Herald Sun’s Page 13 that he stood by his staff’s decision to ban Crowe, his girlfriend Britney Theriot and their guests saying their “slobby gym gear” didn’t meet his restaurant’s standards of dress. However, the restaurant has reconsidered its dress code sharing a sign on social media which reads: Dress smart casual unless you’re Russell Crowe, then wear whatevs **management reserve the right to refuse entry. The post was accompanied by an open letter to Crowe in the caption: Dear Russell,⁠ During your last visit it seems we got off on the wrong foot. After much reflection on what occurred, we have made a permanent change to our dress code. ⁠ We would love to see you again in the future, you’re always welcome at Mr. Miyagi. Little relief in sight amid ‘staggering’ rise in rents In what won’t be news for many who are renting, the cost of accommodation is soaring in many parts of the country, particularly for houses. According to data from PropTrack, rental increases are exceeding a third over the past year in the most stretched regions of Australia. With vacancy rates at below 1% in some places and the number of both overseas students and migrants picking up, more increases in prices are coming, as noted by our colleague Bridie Jabour: One effect of higher interest rates is that the ability of renters to get into the property market is reduced since their loan limits are reduced faster than real estate prices have fallen – so far, at least. According to ANZ, capital city prices will fall 10% in 2023, to bring the total peak-to-trough decline to 18%. “A modest recovery in the latter part of 2024 remains our base case,” it said last week. It’s far from the busiest time for auctions, but the latest numbers so far don’t point to a lot of panic selling. Figures from CoreLogic showed that preliminary clearance rates for the past week were just shy of 70% (before they’ll be revised down a bit). The key change is that there were about a third fewer auctions than this time last year as would-be vendors hold off or even withdraw from their property from the market. Wider spread of Japanese encephalitis than previously thought, Victorian health department says A survey of more than 800 people in northern Victoria has found the Japanese encephalitis virus has infected more people than first thought, the Victorian Department of Health said. The survey, which also asked people to give a blood sample, found approximately one in 30 participants had evidence of having a prior Japanese encephalitis infection. The department says the results suggests many more people may have been infected than the 13 cases reported in last year’s mosquito season. Participants who showed evidence of prior infection were identified in all three regions that took part in the survey: Loddon Mallee, Goulburn Valley and Ovens Murray. Victoria’s deputy chief health officer Assoc Prof Deborah Friedman said: By finding more cases than we were previously aware of, this important research reinforces the risk to all in the community that mosquito-borne diseases pose – especially in light of recent flood activity. There are sensible steps people can take to avoid mosquito bites. Wear long, loose-fitting, light-coloured clothing, use insect repellents, clear stagnant water around homes or properties, and avoid the outdoors when mosquitoes are observed, especially at dusk and dawn. The eligibility criteria for vaccination against Japanese encephalitis has been extended to seven local government areas: Greater Bendigo, Northern Grampians, Hindmarsh, Horsham, Buloke, Yarriambiack and West Wimmera. ‘Drastic increase’ in principals wanting to retire early or quit, new research shows The number of school principals wanting to retire early or quit has tripled since 2019, research shows, as heavy workloads and teacher shortages place pressure on the sector. The research, released by the Australian Catholic University today surveyed about 2,500 principals in 2022. Sixty-five principals planned to quit or retire early in 2022 – more than triple than three years before than. It found heavy workloads and a lack of time to focus on teaching and learning were the top two sources of stress, followed by teacher shortages and mental health issues of students and staff, including burnout and stress. ACU Investigator and former principal Dr Paul Kidson said the numbers pointed to a worrying trend: It is a drastic increase when you look at the whole picture. Principals’ workloads, stress caused by issues including the national teacher shortage across public, Catholic, and independent schools, and demands outside the classroom have escalated to unsustainable levels. This data shows serious dashboard warning lights flashing all over the place. These are warning signs that we have not seen so acutely before, and we have almost 2,500 people saying the same thing. ‘No intention’ of making super changes, PM says Anthony Albanese says his government has “no intention of making changes in superannuation” but says it wants to have a debate about its purpose – not exactly shutting down expectations that those with the biggest super balances could see their lucrative tax breaks trimmed down. The PM appeared on The Project last night, where he got a few questions on the potential super changes that others in the government have been discussing. On the table at this stage is the potential for tax concessions for super voluntary contributions (taxed at 15%, much lower than income tax) to be shaved down for people with balances over $3m – which is less than 1% of the country. Channel 10 showed the PM a clip of an interview during last year’s election when Albanese said the government had no intention of making changes to super. Albanese responded: I said, we had no intention. That’s not the objective here. But people are coming forward with ideas. We’re not shutting down debate. It is appropriate there be debate about the policy future across a range of issues, particularly in the context of the trillion dollars in debt we inherited. But we have no intention of making changes in superannuation. We will have the debate about the purpose and the definition of what it is and try to enshrine that in legislation, so people get what the purpose is much more clearer. Albanese went on to say that the government “had no changes”. Of course, this is a common type of phrasing from governments considering changes, to say they have made no changes (with a “yet” often the unsaid but mutually understood part of that line): We’ve had no changes. We’re not here announcing changes. We are having a discussion about the purpose of superannuation. This is all hypothetical. So if we make an announcement, then you can scrutinise what that announcement is, but we’ve made it very clear that no decisions have been made. Australia’s T20 World Cup glory against South Africa In sporting news, Australia has taken out the T20 World Cup for the third time in a row, enjoying a 19-run victory over host nation South Africa. Player of the match Beth Mooney scored an unbeaten 74 from just 53 deliveries, helping to guide Australia for six for 156. You can read the full report from Raf Nicholson at Newlands: For the first time in Australia, a class action by former footballers is being launched agains the AFL for the effects of concussion injuries. It’s an issue my colleague Stephanie Convery has been covering with powerful stories about what individuals like Terry Strong and their families have gone through. The Melbourne firm Margalit Injury Lawyers is bringing the action in the supreme court, and managing principal Michel Margalit has spoken to ABC News about the issue: We have been consulting with many, many former AFL players and AFLW players. It’s astounding how many people have suffered from life-altering concussion-type injuries. At this time we have been building a case and we have intention in lodging a class action this week in relation to their loss of earnings and pain and suffering. At this stage, what we have been looking at is a public liability-type of claim which is separate to any of the compensation funds that currently exist. There are a number of piecemeal fund-related compensation schemes and what we’re concerned about is that these funds do not properly compensate the players and the compensation available is much, much less and there aren’t appropriate measures for redress if people are not happy. There’s been a huge groundswell over the previous years. There’s been class actions in America and in the UK. The class action in America garnered a settlement of almost a billion dollars, but there’s also been more science emerging and it’s not around the impact of concussion as such, but because that’s been well-established since 1995, but we’re now able to prove that these players who have ongoing symptoms that it’s actually connected to their playing of football. Margalit says compensation is expected “to be in the same vicinity as the NFL class action, so many hundreds of millions of dollars”. Scamps on Liverpool plains Independent MP Sophie Scamps visited the Liverpool plains last week for a conference of farmers and traditional owners fighting Santos coal seam project and the accompanying Hunter gas pipeline. While the inland plains are a long way from Scamps’ northern beaches seat of Mackellar, she said she was concerned about the project because her constituents’ top concern remains climate action. Scamps told ABC News this morning: Strong action on climate change has been the No 1 issue for the people of Mackellar before and during the election. We just conducted a survey and strong action on climate change is one of the things top of mind for the people there. … We know that oil and gas can’t go ahead anywhere. And that is what is proposed on the Liverpool plains. On the concerns from locals in the Liverpool plains, Scamps says: They are concerned about the impact on climate change, because methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases – 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. They’re also very concerned and we had people in tears, very concerned about the impact on food product ion on the farmland. The Liverpool plains, it is one of the most fertile pieces of land, matched only with the Ukraine, is the alluvial soil which is up to 10 metres deep there. It is Australia’s food bowl and also the rest of the world’s food bowl. So farmers are concerned about how this will impact their farming. They are concerned and any change to the levels of the land will make a huge impact. The subsidence that can happen with coal-seam gas mining would be a big problem for them. And then the other major is – how it will impact the water supply and the aquifers below the land. Because with coal-seam gas, you need to take out the water first. It needs to be expelled and evaporated and that will impact the aquifers below the land and we know that those aquifers in the Liverpool plains feed the Murray-Darling Basin. There’s huge impacts down the line. So food security, water security, climate change and just destruction of the environment.

Thousands gathered at Hamer Hall and video tributes came from Elton John, Hugh Jackman, Dolly Parton, Pink, Barry Gibb and Mariah Carey. Newton-John, who has a string of No 1 hits worldwide and starred in movies such as Grease and Xanadu, died in August aged 73. Members of Newton-John’s family also gave touching tributes, with her husband John Easterling saying she was a “healer”. You have to understand, I wasn’t an Olivia fan, I didn’t know any Olivia music, I’d never even seen Grease. But at this small theatre in Miami, she started singing Pearls on a Chain, and there was this healing moving through the audience. And it hit me like a laser beam in the chest, that Olivia was a healer, and this was one of her mediums of healing. IT outage at Gold Coast airport In more airport news, an IT outage at the Gold Coast airport has left passengers unable to check in for flights. Tudge advisers to front robodebt inquiry Top advisers to former human services minister Alan Tudge will appear at the royal commission into the unlawful robodebt scheme, AAP reports. The chief of staff and a former policy adviser to Tudge will front the inquiry in Brisbane at the fourth block of hearings into the automated debt assessment and recovery program. The robodebt scheme continued to operate for several years despite concerns it was unlawful, with some people taking their own lives while being pursued for debt. Tudge has already appeared before the inquiry, where he said his understanding of income averaging was that it had been used for decades and it did not occur to him it may have been unlawful: My mind was not acting as a lawyer. It was acting as an implementer of the policy. Tudge has since announced his resignation from federal politics, triggering a byelection in his outer-eastern Melbourne seat of Aston. Three other former social service ministers are also set to front the hearing this week. Stuart Robert and Michael Keenan will front hearings for the first time while Marise Payne will reappear after previously giving evidence in December. Annette Musolino, former chief counsel at the Department of Human Services, will also appear for the second time. The royal commission is set to hand down its report on 30 June after the deadline was extended when an extra 100,000 documents were produced. Hundreds of Jetstar travellers spent almost seven hours on the tarmac at Alice Springs airport yesterday. Their flight from Bangkok to Melbourne was diverted to Alice Springs after a passenger experienced a suspected stroke and required urgent medical assistance. Upon arrival into Alice Springs the passenger was taken to hospital by ambulance. While the aircraft was on the ground in Alice Springs, an electrical issue was detected, which required a replacement part to be sourced from Sydney. Jetstar explained that the 320 passengers had been stuck on board because the airport lacked customs facilities: As a domestic airport, Alice Springs does not have customs processing facilities and we worked with Border Agencies, the NT Police and the local Airport Authority to provide passengers with the option to disembark into a specially partitioned section of the Airport. They were then transferred directly onto the replacement aircraft. We worked with the local Airport to provide passengers with food, drinks and snacks. We appreciate this has been a lengthy delay and frustrating experience. Safety is always our first priority, and we thank passengers for their patience and understanding as we supported the passenger requiring urgent medical assistance and worked to get everyone else on their way as quickly as possible. The passengers from Thailand have arrived in Melbourne after a second aircraft flew them from Alice Springs yesterday afternoon. The government will set up a new cybersecurity office inside the Department of Home Affairs and investigate whether to ban the payment of ransoms to hackers, in the wake of major online attacks affecting millions of Australians. Prime minister Anthony Albanese and home affairs minister Clare O’Neil will announce later today that it will establish a coordinator for cybersecurity, leading a National Office for Cyber Security, inside the Department of Home Affairs. It will lead a central response from the government to major cyber incidents. The government claims it has inherited “a cyber mess” from the former Coalition government. The new position will lead coordination and action on hacks like the Optus breach. The announcement will come in a cybersecurity roundtable that the PM will lead in Sydney today. Areas of discussion for that meeting will include whether the government should prohibit the payment of ransoms or extortion demands by cyber criminals, in a bid to deter such attacks – the logic being, that if Australians are legally banned from paying ransoms, criminals will have less chance of getting ransoms. The meeting will also discuss what impact such a ransom ban would have, as well as talk about boosting cyber skills and workforce through education or immigration changes. O’Neil: The case for change is clear. Australia has a patchwork of policies, laws and frameworks that are not keeping up with the challenges presented by the digital age. Voluntary measures and poorly executed plans will not get Australia where we need to be to thrive in the contested environment of 2030. To achieve our vision of being the world’s most cyber secure country by 2030, we need the unified effort of government, industry and the community. The expert advisory board’s leader, Andy Penn, said Australia’s national security and economic success “rely on us getting our cyber settings right”: If we are to lift and sustain cyber resilience and security, it must be an integrated whole-of-nation endeavour. We need a coordinated and concerted effort by governments, individuals, and businesses of all sizes. Cyber attacks occurred last year with ‘no cyber emergency response function’, O’Neil says A new national cybersecurity coordinator will be appointed today as the government wants to better prevent large-scale data breaches of people’s personal details. The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, said it would have made a “huge difference” had the new coordinator and agency been in place when the Optus and Medibank cyber attacks occurred last year: When Optus hit – much to my shock as cybersecurity minister – there was no cyber emergency response function in the Australian government. I’m really angry about that. Those events were completely foreseeable events that were completely not foreseen by the previous government. Now we dealt with those incidents well, but that is in spite of government structures, not because of them. Literally cabinet ministers stepped in and managed the incident in a way that is not sustainable when we are under basically relentless cyber attack. So what we will have now is an individual in the public service who is going to coordinate the response across government and make sure that not only are we deterring and preventing cyber attack – we’re not going to reduce cyber risk to zero – that Australians can get up off the mat quickly get services restored, get their data protected, get their identity numbers changed. These are the sorts of things that this person would have been able to do much more seamlessly. Labor’s lead narrows a month out from NSW election The NSW Coalition government appears to be closing the gap on Labor less than a month before voters decide who will lead the state for the next four years, a key poll shows. The Newspoll survey of 1,014 voters published in the Australian shows primary support for Labor has fallen by four percentage points since September to 36%, while the Coalition has gained two points to 37%. Premier Dominic Perrottet has increased his lead as preferred premier over opposition leader Chris Minns to 43% versus 33%. In September Perrottet led his opposition counterpart by 39% to 35%. But on a two-party-preferred basis Labor leads the government on 52% versus 48%, the poll published today found. If replicated across the state on election day on 25 March, Labor could win 42 seats and the Coalition 41, with crossbenchers likely to decide which party will form government. The Newspoll was conducted between 20 and 23 February. – AAP ‘It really was a war zone’ On the state of thousands still displaced a year on from the northern rivers floods, Murray Watt had this to say: There has been substantial progress in the recovery. When those floods hit we were talking about something like 18,000 people who’ve been displaced from their homes across Queensland and New South Wales and obviously the numbers now are far fewer than that, but we have to be honest and acknowledge that there are people still living in situations that none of us would want to be living in. So we do continue to work with the New South Wales government to get people back in their homes as quickly as possible. But I guess it does reflect that just the sheer scale of this event. I’ll never forget the scenes that I saw and it’s more when I arrived there. It really was a war zone whether you’re talking about the CBD or particularly places like South and North Lismore, which were just completely destroyed. And unfortunately, you know, as much as we might like to think that people would be back in their homes immediately, it does take a bit of time. But every time I go there, I’m reminded of the urgency of getting things moving. I had another meeting with the NSW Reconstruction Commission, when I was there last week, to say if there’s anything we can be doing at a federal level to help with it. Watt says the buy backprogram is “definitely further advanced in Queensland than it is in New South Wales” and expects the uptake in NSW to accelerate after 3oo to 400 offers are made by the end of AprilL But if the Queensland experiences any guide, once those offers do start being made, they do accelerate, and I’d certainly be hopeful that will happen in New South Wales as well. Flood recovery funding The federal and NSW government have unveiled a $300m disaster recovery program in a bid to end the northern rivers’ cycle of repair/damage/repair after floods. Emergency management minister Murray Watt is speaking to ABC radio a year after the devastating floods. Asked about whether this funding is only a drop in the ocean when a report out in January estimated the cost of the northern rivers flood disaster at close to $10bn, Watt insists the funding from governments has made a substantial difference, “but the reality is that the damage was immense and it can’t be fixed immediately”. Watt says this new funding will be different because the focus will be on building back not as it was before, but with better standards of flood mitigation: What’s different about the funding that we’re announcing today with the NSW government is that we’re not just repairing roads and bridges and causeways to the same standard they were, which only guarantees that they’re going to flood again in the future. We’re actually making them more resilient so that when we do face future flooding, we hopefully can protect people a lot better than they were protected last time around … This kind of long-term thinking is something that we haven’t really seen enough of at the federal level. And we’re now partnering actively with state governments, we’ve approved similar programs in Queensland and other states as well, because we want to make sure when we are spending what is literally billions of dollars recovering from these events, that we actually think about the future and try to limit that damage further down the track as well. $25m for Alice Springs community organisations The government is committing $25m to community organisations in Alice Springs as part of the federal response to alcohol-related crime and anti-social behaviour in the Northern Territory. The money is to provide funding certainty for organisations running wellbeing projects, remote outreach programs and alcohol projects. The funds were announced this month by Anthony Albanese but the specific organisations to receive the cash have now been named. Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney said the funding represented a two-year extension, which she said would “give organisations the certainty they need and allow them to continue the important work they’re doing”: Certainty in access to safety and community wellbeing services is critical for First Nations communities, especially children and young people living in and around Alice Springs. Marion Scrymgour, Labor MP for the NT seat of Lingiari, said the groups getting funding were “are at the coalface of the challenges facing our region”: Having spent a lot of time with community organisations – I know how hard they work for our community. The organisations being funded include $6.3m for the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress Aboriginal Corporation, for transport, alcohol, violence intervention and family violence services; $1.3m for the Akeyulerre Aboriginal Corporation, for wellbeing and self-reliance projects; $2.6m for Bushmob Aboriginal Corporation, for remote outreach and youth residential rehabilitation; and $2.6m for drug and alcohol services for prisoners and transitional programs. Future emissions from existing and new Australian coal and gas production are likely to dwarf official government estimates and undermine the Albanese government’s planned revamp of the climate change policy known as the safeguard mechanism, according to a new analysis. The analysis by the global research firm Climate Analytics, commissioned by climate groups, comes at the start of a two-day parliamentary inquiry hearing into the government’s planned changes to the scheme. The safeguard is a Coalition policy that was proposed to limit pollution from 215 major industrial facilities but hasn’t. You can read about its history and Labor’s plan here. The Climate Analytics report, commissioned by the Solutions for Climate Australia, said the government appeared to have substantially underestimated the likely future emissions from coal and liquefied natural gas production. It said official projections for the LNG industry suggested a 20% rise by 2030. Climate Analytics estimated the increase above 2021 levels was likely to be 36%. For coalmines, the government projected a 10% fall in emissions. Climate Analytics projected at least a 23%, and possibly up to a 116%, increase. The report did not look directly at the economic impact on proposed developments of companies being required to either make deeper emissions cuts each year, or to effectively pay for cuts elsewhere by buying carbon offsets. But Climate Analytics’ chief executive Bill Hare said he believed the likely result for fossil fuels developments would be rising direct emissions and a “free for all” of offset use: The safeguard mechanism will therefore not work to drive emissions down as it’s supposed to, particularly given the integrity issues found to be widespread within Australia’s offset scheme by independent experts. You can read about what could happen given Labor has ruled out banning new fossil fuel projects here. Press freedom roundtable Attorney general Mark Dreyfus will today convene a press freedom roundtable in Parliament House, saying journalists should never be “charged or even jailed just for doing their jobs”. Major outlets including Guardian Australia, the ABC, News Corp, Nine, SBS and Seven will attend the meeting, which the government announced last month. At the time, Dreyfus said the government “believes a strong and independent media is vital to democracy and holding governments to account”, and said improved protections for press freedom were needed. “The Albanese Government intends to progress legislative reform as a priority,” he said, with Monday’s meeting to discuss options for reform. The meeting will bring together two dozen organisations and companies, including the Alliance for Journalists’ Freedom, the Right to Know Coalition, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, the Press Council, AAP, Australian Radio Network, First Nations Media, Private Media and Solstice Media. Dreyfus said: I’m looking forward to a full and frank discussion about press freedom issues in Australia and further options for reform. A strong and independent media matters. There is agreement across the Parliament and the community that improved protections are overdue. Unlike the former government, which ignored successive bipartisan committee reports, the Albanese Government will progress press freedom reform as a priority. Future emissions from existing and new Australian coal and gas production are likely to dwarf official government estimates, new analysis shows. It could undermine the Albanese government’s planned revamp of the climate change policy known as the safeguard mechanism, according to global research firm Climate Analytics. The research has been commissioned by climate groups and comes at the start of a two-day parliamentary inquiry hearing into the government’s planned changes to the scheme. Also out today, the government is setting up a new agency set up to tackle mass cyber attacks, with the with prime minister Anthony Albanese today announcing the establishment of a coordinator for cybersecurity. The announcement of the new post as well as the release of a discussion paper about a new cybersecurity strategy will be made at the cybersecurity roundtable in Sydney today, which will be attended by business, security and tech leaders, as well as home affairs minister Clare O’Neil. O’Neil told ABC Radio the new agency would attempt to provide strategy and structure when cyber attacks occur as well as ensuring different parts of the government were effectively communicating with each other. Emergency management minister Murray Watt will be speaking to ABC Radio shortly a year, on from the Northern Rivers flood disaster. We’ll bring you what he has to say. In Melbourne last night thousands of friends, family and fans gathered for a last farewell for Dame Olivia Newton John at her state memorial, which included speeches from her husband and daughter, as well as music from her friend Delta Goodrem. Let’s get into it."

                    "bodyText": "Good evening, we are now closing this blog but you can read all our Ukraine coverage here. President Vladimir Putin has said that Russia had no choice but to take into account the nuclear capabilities of Nato as the US-led military alliance was seeking the defeat of Russia. “In today’s conditions, when all the leading Nato countries have declared their main goal as inflicting a strategic defeat on us, so that our people suffer as they say, how can we ignore their nuclear capabilities in these conditions?” Putin told Rossiya 1 state television, according to Tass. The west, Putin claimed, wants to liquidate Russia. “They have one goal: to disband the former Soviet Union and its fundamental part – the Russian Federation,” Putin said, according to Tass. The west, he said, was an indirect accomplice to the “crimes” committed by Ukraine. Ukraine’s military said that Russia conducted unsuccessful offensives near Yahidne over the past day, after Russia’s Wagner mercenary group claimed to have captured the village in eastern Ukraine near the focus on intense fighting. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in a morning update that Russia keeps concentrating its offensive efforts along the entire Bakhmut frontline, were Yahidne is located. Two Russian rockets hit a house on the outskirts of Kramatorsk, one of the main towns in the Ukrainian-controlled Donetsk region, on Saturday afternoon. The rockets appear to have missed their target, falling on the side of a GP surgery, devastating the house next door as well as damaging houses around it. A Guardian team on the scene said the rockets shells were likely to have come from a Russian Smerch rocket launcher. US president Joe Biden has said the prospect of China negotiating peace between Ukraine and Russia is “just not rational”. Speaking on ABC News about China’s peace plan, he said: “I’ve seen nothing [that] would indicate there’s something that would be beneficial to anyone other than Russia. The idea that China is gonna be negotiating the outcome of a war that’s a totally unjust war for Ukraine is just not rational.” China has not moved towards providing lethal aid that would help Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, and the US has made clear behind closed doors that such a move would have serious consequences, White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Sunday. “Beijing will have to make its own decisions about how it proceeds, whether it provides military assistance, but if it goes down that road, it will come at real costs to China,” Sullivan said in an interview with CNN’s State of the Union programme. Russian online bank Tinkoff, run by TCS Group Holding, said it would suspend trading in euros from Monday after the imposition of a further set of EU sanctions. The EU agreed a 10th round of punitive measures on Friday to punish Russia for invading Ukraine. The package includes cutting off more banks, among them Tinkoff and the private Alfa-Bank, from the Swift global payments system, Reuters reports. The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said it was up to Kyiv to decide when, and under what conditions, to enter talks with Moscow. He suggested the same was true for any decision on recapturing the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and a close ally of the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, will visit Beijing this week, China’s foreign ministry confirmed. Spokesperson Hua Chunying said Lukashenko was due to visit between Tuesday and Thursday, but gave no details about his agenda, the Associated Press reported. Algeria will reopen its embassy in Kyiv one year after it was closed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Algerian state television said on Sunday, citing a foreign ministry statement. “This decision falls within the framework of preserving the interests of the Algerian state and the interests of the national community in this country,” state TV quoted the foreign ministry statement as saying. More than a third of British adults have donated to help the humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine, according to polling that reveals the vast majority of the public remain concerned about the conflict a year on. With charitable drives for those plunged into dire need by the war continuing, a poll commissioned by Christian Aid revealed that 37% of the adult population in the UK had made some kind of donation, while 81% said they remain concerned about the impact of the conflict. Finance chiefs of the world’s largest economies have strongly condemned Moscow for its war on Ukraine, with only China and Russia itself declining to sign a joint statement on Saturday. India, which as chair of the G20 group of economies was hosting a meeting in the city of Bengaluru, was reluctant to raise the issue of the war, but western nations said they could not back any outcome that did not include a condemnation, Reuters reported. Ukraine’s energy minister says the country has been able to amass some power reserves and that there will be no more outages to ration electricity if there are no new Russian strikes, after months of power cuts. There are 180 political prisoners being held in Crimea, according to Ukraine’s rights ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets. Sky News reported that Lubinets wrote on Telegram: “Due to the constant fear of Ukrainian resistance, Russia does not stop harsh repression and persecution of our citizens in the temporarily occupied Crimea: illegal searches, fabricated criminal cases, fabricated sentences, in particular, against representatives of the Indigenous people of the peninsula – the Crimean Tatars.” The Ukrainian official added that the recent deaths in Kremlin cells of two tortured political prisoners was a “flagrant violation of fundamental human rights and norms of international law by Russia”. Germany’s interior minister has warned of a “massive danger” facing Germany from Russian sabotage, disinformation and spying attacks. Nancy Faeser said Vladimir Putin was putting huge resources into cyber-attacks as a key part of his war of aggression. “The cybersecurity concerns have been exacerbated by the war. The attacks of pro-Russia hackers have increased,” she said in an interview with the news network Funke Mediengruppe published on Sunday. Since Germany started supporting Ukraine with weapons deliveries and by introducing sanctions against Russia, cyber-attacks have been on the rise, in particular against energy providers and military organisations. Security experts have been warning of the considerable danger these pose to German domestic security, specifically the cyber-attackers’ ability to target critical infrastructure, as well as political operations such as the Bundestag. The Russian online bank Tinkoff, run by TCS Group Holding, said it would suspend trading in euros from Monday after the imposition of a further set of EU sanctions. The EU agreed a 10th round of punitive measures late on Friday to punish Russia for invading Ukraine. The package includes cutting off more banks, among them Tinkoff and the private Alfa-Bank, from the Swift global payments system, Reuters reports. “Withdrawals in euros will be available. Euro trading will be suspended from [Monday],” Tinkoff said in a statement, adding that trading in other currencies would not be affected. In a separate statement, Tinkoff said it had prepared countermeasures to the sanctions that would allow a transfer of assets to a new company within three weeks. Tinkoff Bank was set up by the entrepreneur Oleg Tinkov, who has become an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Tinkov said last November that he had renounced his Russian citizenship over the war in Ukraine. Tinkoff was forced to sell his 35% stake in the bank’s parent, TCS, to the Russian metals magnate Vladimir Potanin last April after a string of anti-war comments. Vladimir Putin has accused the west of seeking to “dismember” Russia and and to turn the country into a series of weak mini-states. In an interview with the state TV channel Rossiya on Sunday, Putin claimed the US and its Nato allies wanted to “inflict a strategic defeat on us”. He said the aim was to “make our people suffer”, adding: “How can we ignore their nuclear capabilities in these conditions?” Russia’s president said this alleged plot had been under way since the collapse of the USSR. “They tried to reshape the world exclusively on their terms. We had no choice but to react,” he said, adding that the west was complicit in Ukraine’s “crimes”. If Washington got its way, Russia would be divided into Moscow, the Urals and other disparate regions, he continued, claiming there was “written proof” for his assertion. The remarks come at a time when Russian troops have made localised gains in Ukraine’s east but have failed to achieve a major breakthrough. Moscow’s military focus is to capture the entirety of the Donbas region, much of which remains under Kyiv’s control. A statement by Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, on Ukraine’s Day of Resistance: “Our commitment to Ukrainians and the principles they’re fighting for – democracy, justice, and freedom – is unwavering. We’ll keep standing with them and using every tool at our disposal to support them.” The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 6pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s stories so far: President Vladimir Putin has said that Russia had no choice but to take into account the nuclear capabilities of Nato as the US-led military alliance was seeking the defeat of Russia. “In today’s conditions, when all the leading Nato countries have declared their main goal as inflicting a strategic defeat on us, so that our people suffer as they say, how can we ignore their nuclear capabilities in these conditions?” Putin told Rossiya 1 state television, according to Tass.

Thousands of people have taken part in a demonstration in central Berlin to protest against giving more weapons to Ukraine, urging the German government to instead pave the way for negotiations with Vladimir Putin. In London, Marina Litvinenko – the widow of a defector poisoned in London – led calls for a Ukrainian victory in the war at a demonstration of several hundred outside the Russian embassy. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest news from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has met with the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan al Saud, in Kyiv today. Footage of the meeting was published by the Saudi Gazette. US president Joe Biden has said the prospect of China negotiating peace between Ukraine and Russia is “just not rational”. Speaking on ABC News about China’s peace plan, he said: I’ve seen nothing [that] would indicate there’s something that would be beneficial to anyone other than Russia. The idea that China is gonna be negotiating the outcome of a war that’s a totally unjust war for Ukraine is just not rational. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and a close ally of the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, will visit Beijing this week, China’s foreign ministry confirmed. Spokesperson Hua Chunying said Lukashenko was due to visit between Tuesday and Thursday, but gave no details about his agenda, the Associated Press reported. Belarus has strongly backed Moscow and allowed its territory to be used as a staging ground for the initial invasion of Ukraine a year ago. Lukashenko has been Belarus’ only president since the position was created in 1994, and crushed 2020 protests over his disputed re-election in a vote that the opposition and western countries regard as fraudulent. The announcement comes as top US officials repeated warnings to China against providing military aid to Russia, saying that it would bring heavy consequences. China has not moved towards providing lethal aid that would help Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, and the US has made clear behind closed doors that such a move would have serious consequences, White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Sunday. “Beijing will have to make its own decisions about how it proceeds, whether it provides military assistance, but if it goes down that road, it will come at real costs to China,” Sullivan said in an interview with CNN’s State of the Union programme.

He suggested the same was true for any decision on recapturing the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. “I am leaning towards saying, yes, Crimea is Ukrainian territory and it therefore has to be given back,” he said in the interview. “But again: this is not a decision that’s up to us to take.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says his troops will eventually drive Russia from all the captured territory, including the Crimean peninsula.

Algeria will reopen its embassy in Kyiv one year after it was closed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Algerian state television said on Sunday, citing a foreign ministry statement. “This decision falls within the framework of preserving the interests of the Algerian state and the interests of the national community in this country,” state TV quoted the foreign ministry statement as saying. “The Algerian embassy in Kyiv, which suspended its activities due to the deteriorating security situation in Ukraine, will be managed by the Charge d’Affaires.” The embassy closed in March last year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported. The decision to reopen the embassy will be effective “as soon as possible”, the statement read. There has been no development for months in the discussion of possible Nato security guarantees for Ukraine, a government spokesperson said. “At the recent meeting of German chancellor Olaf Scholz and French president Emmanuel Macron with Ukrainian leader Zelenskiy, this issue played no role at all,” the spokesperson said in a statement. The statement follows a recent report by the Wall Street Journal that said some of Nato’s biggest European members are floating a defence pact with Ukraine. German defence minister Boris Pistorius on Sunday reacted with scepticism to a Chinese ceasefire proposal for the war in Ukraine. “When I hear reports – and I don’t know whether they are true – according to which China may be planning to supply kamikaze drones to Russia while at the same time presenting a peace plan, then I suggest we judge China by its actions and not its words,” he told German public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk in an interview. A group of MPs were on their way back to London on Sunday after an epic road trip delivering aid to Ukraine. The cross-parliamentary group set off from Dover and drove across Europe to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. Two Labour MPs – Alex Sobel and Anna McMorrin – made the journey together with their Conservative counterparts Kevin Foster and Scott Benton. The group delivered medical equipment and de-mining tools. They dropped off a generator at a village close to the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv and the Belarus border. “A lot of parliamentary groups go on trips and have meetings. We didn’t feel that was appropriate for Ukraine. We wanted to provide practical support, and to show that MPs could go above and beyond,” Sobel said. The trip was made to coincide with the anniversary of Russia’s invasion. The UK parliamentary delegation to Kyiv included Tory MPs Bob Seely and Alicia Kearns, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee. Sobel – the MP for Leeds North West – and McMorrin, who represents Cardiff North, attended Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s press conference on Friday. Asked if this bipartisan model could be repeated elsewhere, Sobel said: “People will be surprised on how many things we can agree on.” The MAD Foundation charity organised the trip. More than a third of British adults have donated to help the humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine, according to polling that reveals the vast majority of the public remain concerned about the conflict a year on. With charitable drives for those plunged into dire need by the war continuing, a poll commissioned by Christian Aid revealed that 37% of the adult population in the UK had made some kind of donation. Eighty-one per cent said they remain concerned about the impact of the conflict. According to Christian Aid, 17.7 million Ukrainians are in need of aid and more than 13 million people are unable to return to their homes one year on from the invasion. Emergency assistance has reached more than 770,000 people affected by the war. John Sentamu, the former archbishop of York who is chair of Christian Aid, said the British public had shown an “overwhelming generosity to the Ukrainian people”. “Vladimir Putin’s invasion has unleashed terrible violence and caused untold suffering to millions of innocent people,” Sentamu said. “We have seen how homes have been destroyed, families torn apart, and innocent people subjected to atrocious violence and trauma. “I am not surprised that so many people across our isles remain worried about the war. We must remember every prayer, every gift, every action is bringing hope to our brothers and sisters in Ukraine. “Christian Aid is therefore urging actors not to give up searching for a just and lasting peace for Ukraine and to ensure the conflict does not cut support for other crises across the globe.” Ukraine’s military said that Russia conducted unsuccessful offensives near Yahidne over the past day, after Russia’s Wagner mercenary group claimed to have captured the village in eastern Ukraine near the focus on intense fighting. The General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said in a morning update that Russia keeps concentrating its offensive efforts along the entire Bakhmut frontline, were Yahidne is located. Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Saturday his forces had captured Yahidne. On Friday, he had claimed control of Berkhivka, an adjacent village on the outskirts of Bakhmut. But the Ukrainian bulletin said attacks were continuing, citing “unsuccessful offensives” near six settlements, including Yahidne and Berkhivka, in the Donetsk region, which Moscow claims to have annexed. Reuters could not verify the battlefield reports of either side. Ukraine’s Sunday bulletin said Russian forces had shelled the areas of 22 settlements along that part of the frontline in Donetsk over the past day, while Ukraine had repelled 71 in Donetsk and elsewhere along the frontline. President Vladimir Putin has said that Russia had no choice but to take into account the nuclear capabilities of Nato as the US-led military alliance was seeking the defeat of Russia. “In today’s conditions, when all the leading Nato countries have declared their main goal as inflicting a strategic defeat on us, so that our people suffer as they say, how can we ignore their nuclear capabilities in these conditions?” Putin told Rossiya 1 state television, according to Tass. The west, Putin claimed, wants to liquidate Russia. “They have one goal: to disband the former Soviet Union and its fundamental part – the Russian Federation,” Putin said, according to Tass. The west, he said, was an indirect accomplice to the “crimes” committed by Ukraine. A Ukraine military official says a fresh push to retake seized territory is planned for spring, saying Kyiv’s forces will “not stop until we get our country back to its 1991 borders”. Vadym Skibitsky, the deputy chief of Ukrainian military intelligence, told a German newspaper group on Sunday: One of our strategic military objectives is to try to drive a wedge into the Russian front in the south, between Crimea and Russian territory. Beyond that, he said, “the objective of our counter-offensive is to liberate all the occupied territories of Ukraine, including Crimea”. Reuters also reported that Skibitsky raised the possibility of future Ukrainian strikes on “arms depots or military equipment on Russian territory, for example around the city of Belgorod, from where attacks on Ukraine are launched”. Isobel Koshiw has filed this report on Ukrainian civilians regularly being caught up in poorly targeted Russian attacks: Two Russian rockets hit a house on the outskirts of Kramatorsk, one of the main towns in the Ukrainian-controlled Donetsk region, on Saturday afternoon. The rockets appear to have missed their target, falling on the side of a local GP surgery, devastating the house next door as well as damaging houses around it. A Guardian team on the scene assessed the rockets shells likely came from a Russian Smerch rocket launcher. A woman in her 60s, who lived in the neighbouring house, was injured and quickly whisked away by an ambulance, according to eyewitnesses. A neighbour who lived opposite and declined to give her name said: She came out of her house screaming and then fell on the ground. The impact of the rocket also tore down the electricity line, cutting power to the surrounding neighbourhood, according to neighbours who came out to see the devastation. Poorly targeted attacks like these have been a regular occurrence for those living along the frontlines, particularly in Ukrainian-controlled Donetsk and Luhansk, where the fighting has been consistently heavy since the invasion started. Since the summer, Ukrainian officials have reported Russia using imprecise weapons in an attempt to hit Ukrainian military bases and equipment behind the frontlines which have resulted in a steady stream of civilian deaths. On 14 January, Russia launched an anti-ship missile, weighing a whopping 5,800kg, which hit and destroyed an entire section of an apartment block in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro. At least 46 people died and dozens more were injured. Oleksiy Yakovlenko, the head doctor at the main civilian hospital for the Donbas region, told the Guardian that the recent concentration of fighting in six areas of the region had led to a decrease in the number of civilian casualties but the numbers remained high. If a month ago, we were receiving around 100s patients every day, now it’s in the dozens. Finance chiefs of the world’s largest economies have strongly condemned Moscow for its war on Ukraine, with only China and Russia itself declining to sign a joint statement on Saturday. India, which as chair of the Group of 20 economies was hosting a meeting in the city of Bengaluru, was reluctant to raise the issue of the war but western nations insisted they could not back any outcome that did not include a condemnation, Reuters reported. The lack of consensus among G20 members meant India resorted to issuing a “chair’s summary and outcome document” in which it simply summed up the two days of talks and noted disagreements. Most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed that it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy,” it said, citing disruption of supply chains, risks to financial stability and continuing energy and food insecurity. “There were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions,” it said, referring to measures put in place by the United States, European countries and others to punish Russia for the invasion and to starve it of revenues. The outcome was similar to that of a G20 summit in Bali last November when host Indonesia also issued a final declaration acknowledging differences. Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin said forces of his Wagner group had captured the village of Yahidne, just north of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, on Saturday. But Ukrainian military reports issued a day after the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine suggested that villages near the key town remained under Kyiv’s control. Reuters could not independently confirm Prigozhin’s claim, made in a short audio message, or the report by the Ukrainian military’s general staff. However, other sources reported that Russian forces had entered Yahidne as the situation around Bakhmut appeared to grow more perilous for its Ukrainian defenders. Russian forces have been trying to take the now shattered Donbas city for seven months, inching forward at a glacial pace to try to encircle it with a narrowing corridor for Ukrainian defender. According to accounts from the Bakhmut area, while Russian forces were bogged down to the south of the city, to the north they had advanced over a kilometre into the outskirts of Yahidne. Large assaults were also being reported to the south-west towards Ivanivske in the direction of the T0504 highway with the aim of cutting access to the city from the west. Ukrainian troops in the town reported that the Russian tactic appeared to be the familiar one of throwing large groups of troops against their defences. Commenting on the current Russian tactics last week, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said the Russians aim was to wear down Ukraine’s defences by sheer weight of numbers, even if that meant taking huge casualties. Recent footage from Bakhmut showed Ukrainian armoured vehicles pouring autocannon and machine-gun fire into Russian positions. With the situation in Bakhmut described as difficult, the head of Ukraine’s land forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, visited the sector on Saturday to consult with commanders. The Bakhmut sector is one of six areas where Russian forces have been expended increased effort in the past three weeks as part of a stepped-up offensive along the eastern front that has yet to produce any significant gains. While western analysts suggest the capture of Bakhmut would be used as a propaganda victory by the Kremlin, many are sceptical that the city’s fall – and after so many losses – would offer a significant advantage. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine. This is Adam Fulton bringing you the latest developments. Yevgeny Prigozhin says his Wagner mercenary group has captured the eastern Ukrainian village of Yahidne, near the fiercely contested city of Bakhmut. However, Ukrainian military reports issued on Saturday suggested villages near the city remained under Kyiv’s control. Reuters said it could not independently confirm Prigozhin’s claim or the report by the Ukrainian military’s general staff. On Friday, Prigozhin said Wagner had taken control of Berkhivka, an adjacent village on the outskirts of Bakhmut. More on that story soon. In other key developments as it approaches 9am in Kyiv: Ukraine’s energy minister says the country has been able to amass some power reserves and that there will be no more outages to ration electricity if there are no new Russian strikes, after months of power cuts. Thousands of people have taken part in a demonstration in central Berlin to protest against giving more weapons to Ukraine, urging the German government to instead pave the way for negotiations with Vladimir Putin. In London, Marina Litvinenko – the widow of a defector poisoned in London – led calls for a Ukrainian victory in the war at a demonstration of several hundred outside the Russian embassy. A meeting of finance chiefs of the Group of 20 leading economies has ended without a consensus, with Russia and China objecting to the description of the war in Ukraine in a final document. In a statement at the end of the meeting in Bengaluru, the G20 chair, India, said a statement demanding Russia’s withdrawal from Ukraine was endorsed by all members except Moscow and Beijing. The French president has said China’s engagement in peace in Ukraine is a “good thing”. Emmanuel Macron told reporters he would visit China in early April, in part to seek Beijing’s help with ending the war. “China must help us put pressure on Russia so that it never uses chemical or nuclear weapons,” he said. The US has intelligence that the Chinese government is considering providing Russia with drones and ammunition for use in the war in Ukraine, according to US officials. They said it did not appear Beijing had made a final decision yet, CNN reported, but Russia-China negotiations about the price and scope of the equipment were ongoing. Poland’s largest oil company, PKN Orlen, has stopped receiving oil via the Druzhba pipeline from Russia, its CEO, Daniel Obajtek, has said. Orlen said it could fully supply its refineries via sea and that consumers would not be affected by the halt. Russian oil accounts for about 10% of Polish supply. Explosions have reportedly been heard in the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine, according to Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the city’s exiled mayor. The explosions were reported in the location of a large Russian military personnel cluster, he said, adding: “It’s a good trend.” Ukraine’s armed forces have in recent days claimed strikes on Mariupol, previously thought to be outside the effective range of Ukrainian missiles. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has dismissed as “unrealistic” China’s proposal to end the conflict. Podolyak posted on Twitter that Beijing should not “bet on an aggressor who broke [international] law and will lose the war”. President Zelenskiy has cautiously welcomed China’s 12-point proposal to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but said it would be acceptable only if it led to Vladimir Putin pulling his troops out from all occupied Ukrainian territory. Russia appears to have run out of its current stock of Iranian-made drones and will seek to resupply, the UK Ministry of Defence’s latest update says. Russia most likely saw the drones as “useful decoys which can divert Ukrainian air defences from more effective Russian cruise missiles”, it said. The European Union has agreed to impose a 10th package of sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, just in time for a self-imposed deadline to mark the first anniversary of the war. The latest round of sanctions tackled the banking sector, advanced technologies and Russia’s access to technology that could be used for civilian and military purposes, said the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell. Joe Biden has ruled out “for now” sending American advanced fighter jets to Ukraine, saying Volodymyr Zelenskiy “doesn’t need F-16s now”. The US president told the American Broadcasting Company “there is no basis upon which there is a rationale, according to our military now, to provide F-16s” to Ukraine. The Belarus president, Alexander Lukashenko, said he and Vladimir Putin spoke for a long time on Friday. Lukashenko’s remarks to reporters came as China’s foreign ministry confirmed he is expected to visit China on Tuesday. A former commander of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has been arrested after allegedly attacking a police officer in Oslo, according to Norwegian prosecutors. Andrey Medvedev, who has been living in Norway in January since he fled from Russia, was allegedly detained in the early hours of Wednesday after a fight outside a bar in the Norwegian capital. Thousands of tickets for the Eurovision song contest are to be allocated to Ukrainians who have been forced from their homes and are living in the UK. The UK government also announced £10m in funding to “help ensure the event truly showcases Ukrainian culture”."

                    "headline": "Vladimir Putin accuses west of seeking to ‘dismember’ Russia",
                    "bodyText": "Vladimir Putin has accused the west of seeking to “dismember” Russia and and to turn the vast country into a series of weak mini-states. In an interview with the state TV channel Rossiya on Sunday, Putin claimed the US and its Nato allies wanted to “inflict a strategic defeat on us”. The aim, he said, was to “make our people suffer”, adding: “How can we ignore their nuclear capabilities in these conditions?” Russia’s president said this alleged plot had been under way since the collapse of the USSR. “They tried to reshape the world exclusively on their terms. We had no choice but to react,” he said, adding that the west was complicit in Ukraine’s “crimes”. If Washington got its way, Russia would be divided into Moscow, the Urals, and other disparate regions, he said, claiming there was “written proof” for his assertion. Putin’s comments follow the first anniversary on Friday of Russia’s full-blown invasion of Ukraine. They are part of an apparent attempt to boost popular support for Moscow’s war of choice by recasting it as a necessary and defensive struggle for Russia’s national survival reminiscent of the Soviet Union’s battle against the Nazis. The remarks come at a time when Russian troops have made local gains in Ukraine’s east but have failed to achieve a major breakthrough. Moscow’s military focus is to capture the entirety of the Donbas region, much of which remains under Kyiv’s control. Russian tactical groups have partially encircled the city of Bakhmut, where fighting had raged for months. They were reportedly pressing from the north and south. The only road into the centre – a key Ukrainian supply route – is under Russian artillery fire. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s military dismissed claims by Russia’s Wagner mercenary group that it had captured Yahidne, a village on Bakhmut’s northern outskirts. It said intense fighting was going on across the whole frontline. On Saturday the founder of the Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his forces had taken Yahidne and the nearby village of Berkhivka. The latest Ukrainian update cited “unsuccessful” Russian offensives in the two settlements and four others. All were subject to heavy shelling, it said. Unconfirmed reports on the Telegram channel suggested Ukrainian brigades had flooded the path of a Russian advance by blowing up a dam near Bakhmut. The Ukrainian army command used similar tactics last spring as part of its successful defence of Kyiv. Ukraine’s military strategy is to hold the line in the Donbas region and to launch a counteroffensive once more western military hardware arrives, by late spring. The most likely direction is towards the occupied southern city of Melitopol and Crimea. In his latest message Volodymyr Zelenskiy reaffirmed his commitment to evict Russia from all Ukrainian territory it has stolen including Crimea. Putin annexed the peninsula nine years ago on Sunday using undercover special units nicknamed “little green men”. Zelenskiy posted old photos of a pro-Ukrainian demonstration outside Crimea’s regional parliament in the now occupied city of Simferopol. Many of those who attended the rally were Tatars, Crimea’s original Muslim Turkic inhabitants, persecuted by Russia and its spy agencies since 2014, and previously by Stalin. “Nine years ago, Russian aggression began in Crimea,” Zelenskiy wrote. “By returning Crimea, we will restore peace. This is our land. Our people. Our history. We will return the Ukrainian flag to every corner of Ukraine.” He added: “Qırım serbest olacaq!” – “Crimea will be free!” in the Tatar language. It is unclear whether Ukraine’s western partners will support a large-scale Ukrainian military operation to seize back Crimea. There are unanswered questions, too, as to how Kyiv might reintegrate the area. Many pro-Ukrainian residents fled in 2014. Since then about 600,000 Russians have arrived. On Sunday Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said he was increasingly sympathetic to the idea Crimea should be returned. “I am leaning towards saying, yes, Crimea is Ukrainian territory and it therefore has to be given back,” he said in an interview. “But again: this is not a decision that’s up to us to take.” Pistorius said it was for Kyiv to choose when and under what conditions it would hold talks with Moscow. Zelenskiy has welcomed some aspects of a peace plan floated last week by China. But he has said no negotiations can take place until Russian troops get out fully from Ukraine. Western leaders are sceptical over the proposal, and argue that Beijing does not have the international credibility to act as a mediator. Credible or not, China’s initiative may explain why in recent days Russia has launched no ballistic missile attacks on Kyiv, with the capital eerily quiet. Speaking to ABC News, the US president, Joe Biden, dismissed Beijing’s plan. “I’ve seen nothing [that] would indicate there’s something that would be beneficial to anyone other than Russia,” he said. “The idea that China is gonna be negotiating the outcome of a war that’s a totally unjust war for Ukraine is just not rational.” There have been unconfirmed reports that China is on the brink of supplying Moscow with kamikaze drones. Since October Russia has used Iranian-supplied drones to carry out regular attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. On Sunday the White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said no lethal aid from China had reached Russia. He suggested any such move would have serious consequences. “Beijing will have to make its own decisions about how it proceeds, whether it provides military assistance, but if it goes down that road, it will come at real costs to China,” Sullivan told CNN. • This article was amended on 27 February 2023. An earlier version mistranslated “Qırım serbest olacaq!” as “I will be free!” rather than “Crimea will be free!”."

Spokesperson Hua Chunying said Lukashenko was due to visit between Tuesday and Thursday, but gave no details about his agenda, the Associated Press reported. Algeria will reopen its embassy in Kyiv one year after it was closed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Algerian state television said on Sunday, citing a foreign ministry statement. “This decision falls within the framework of preserving the interests of the Algerian state and the interests of the national community in this country,” state TV quoted the foreign ministry statement as saying."

                    "bodyText": "Saturday Night Live opens with former president Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson) addressing the people of East Palestine (“Not a great name”), Ohio following the devastating toxic train derailment that’s thrown the city into turmoil. He’s come bearing McDonald’s and bottled water, but it doesn’t take him long to lose focus, going on a tirade about Rhianna’s Super Bowl performance (“It was all arms”), Pete Buttigieg (“We call him Pete Butt – there’s no way around it”), and popular TV shows Schitt’s Creek and Yellowstone. Later, he brings out Emily Kohrs (Chloe Fineman), the weirdo foreperson of the grand jury investigation into his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election, whose shameless public statements have thrown a monkey wrench into the prosecution’s plans. Fineman brings things to a screeching halt by mugging to the nth degree. It’s her most annoying performance so far, which is saying quite a lot. Woody Harrelson marks his fifth occasion hosting, but alas, there’s no Five Timers jacket waiting for him. The self-described “redneck hippie” lays on the folksy charm, speaking briefly about his “purple” politics (“The red in me thinks you should be allowed to own guns, the blue in me thinks … squirt guns”), before delivering a loopy story about getting high in Central Park that is so convoluted it’s hard to believe the actor isn’t currently stoned out of his gourd. In the first sketch, Harrelson plays a convict being visited by his wife. Their conversation behind a two-way glass is constantly and rudely interrupted by a running commentary from two sassy, pessimistic corrections officers (Ego Nwodim, Kenan Thompson). The third straight segment in a row in which all the humor comes from long-winded rambling. As with the cold open and Harrelson’s monologue, the mostly silent crowd reactions make it painful to watch. In a new Please Don’t Destroy video, Harrelson consoles a crestfallen Ben, who’s worried John and Martin are hanging out without him. Harrelson convinces him to join him on a stakeout, where his fears are confirmed – and then some. He discovers that not only are his best friends lovers who’ve raised a secret family, but they’re holding auditions to replace him (they eventually settled on Harrelson). In the next – extremely one-note – sketch, two buddies go on a rollercoaster ride. Harrelson’s wimpy character freaks out at first, only to have a blast, while Thompson’s braggadocious Air Force veteran immediately passes out from fear. He tries to regain his manhood by riding it again with his wife (Nwodim) only to once again loses his cool, crying and peeing himself. Next, Harrelson plays the proud, hard-ass commander of a nuclear submarine with the unfortunate name “Mr Dingleberry’s Goochballon ASDFJKL; 6969” – the result of an online pole that the Navy hoped would raise their engagement numbers but backfired on them. Another overlong, overly convoluted sketch, this one at least gets points for referencing the action classic Crimson Tide. In a commercial for colon cancer screening device Colon Guard, Harrelson speaks to Thomas, the boxy cartoon mascot who is far too excited to have him “unload” a stool sample inside him. Things turn dark when more boxes show up and threaten him. A great turn at the end reveals that it’s all just a drug-induced hallucination. Weekend Update’s Michael Che invites NBA analyst and Hall of Famer Bill Walton (Johnson) to the desk. Walton claims to be psychic, able see “what is, what was, and what shall be”. Che tries to make him prove it by asking if the Lakers will end up in the playoffs, only for the New Age-y Walton goes off on a spiritual rant. Johnson’s impression is dead-on as usual, but the material leaves a lot to be desired. Later, Colin Jost brings on Gina Bianchi (Heidi Gardner), “a woman with four daughters and one son.” The high-spirited mom doesn’t have the time of day for her girls – all doctors – but she can’t stop bragging about her beloved baby boy Anthony, a 38-year-old psychopath who constantly robs her (sometimes at gunpoint). It’s yet another rendition of a Gardener’s go-to character – she often defaults to a New Jersey accent – but she makes the most of it. Next, Mikey Day plays a movie director who must break the bad news to the cast of his obesity drama, The Hippo, that production is shutting down. Everyone takes it hard, particularly the lead, who gained 460lb for the role. A very clever idea that takes the piss out of Darren Aronofksy’s Oscar-baity The Whale. It says a lot about that film that Harrelson’s fat suit looks about as realistic as Brendan Fraser’s. In the gauzy closer, two tuxedoed men (Harrelson and Bowen Yang) lazily lift weights in “the most beautiful gym in the world”. Their conversation quickly become flirtatious, but the performances remain so deadpan as to be stilted. If the show ended there, it would have been disappointing, but we get a nice stinger during the sign-off when Scarlett Johansson pops in to present a Five Timers jacket … to musical guest Jack White. Combined with a nice insert paying tribute to the late, great Richard Belzer, who served as the warm-up act and an extra in the show’s first few seasons, things close out on a high note."

                    "bodyText": "You enter, stage right, through an unfamiliar door straight into a storeroom. Corridors of shelves bear nameless bubble-wrapped objects, old doors of all sorts are propped against the walls. Oak fitted with barred grilles and ancient locks, reinforced metal, painted panels pierced with Stars of David: why are they here? As in life, so in art: you are immediately looking for clues. The body parts of a building, perhaps, except that the winding warren points to an entire city. Italian lettering appears on a sack. Stencilled numbers hint at the Venetian ghetto. Red darkroom lights cast a fixed glow over it all, as if you were walking through a monochrome photograph. It feels like an image of reality and yet also the reality itself. A label on a swaddled armchair seems to allude to this cognitive mystery. Back Room, it reads – both an instruction to some notional handler, but also a pun on the place in which you find yourself, here and in the artist’s milieu. Mike Nelson, at 55, is a master of these fictive installations through which the visitor passes never knowing what they will encounter or how the story will end. Twice shortlisted for the Turner prize, Britain’s representative at the 2011 Venice Biennale, he is internationally exhibited and renowned. In the past, he often invoked the absence of some imaginary presence – surveillance photographers, Gulf war vets, prisoners, political thinkers. But the Hayward’s gigantic anthology feels far more like a journey through the singular and complex mind of the artist himself. The storeroom’s many doors are portals for the imagination, but they are also preludes of what is to come. Leave and you instantly encounter five more – the doors of the Hayward itself, one of them an exit you no longer quite trust. Nelson makes the real architecture of the gallery seem false. Up a ramp through another door and the front desk of an empty office seems strangely high and the whirring fan sinister. Rickety corridors lead to other doors, other rooms. You are suddenly abroad, trying to book a flight from Nairobi to New York (the Twin Towers are sealed up in a period snowglobe). You are in a sweatshop in India, rags all over the floor. You are on a ferry, at the captain’s bar where a wax hand clutches an eyeball and you can impersonate Elvis in a special mirror. A door appears sealed, but you can wrench it open. The lights are permanently on – try any of the switches. Nelson is surely unique in allowing everything he makes to be tested and touched. There are moments of sudden anxiety. A door creaks open to reveal a sleeping bag that appears to be still in use. The shadow of a light fitting looks like a man with his arms up – don’t shoot. Nelson has a miniaturist’s eye for the vignette – a payphone, a fag butt, a number urgently scribbled on the wall – and a dramatist’s gift for tableaux. A filthy old table in one room is pure Freud: skulls, clay deities, ibex horns, totems. Go round the side and there’s charred wood on the floor as if something was ritually burned. It feels like a shrine to lost gods. It’s getting hotter. There are more rags. The doors multiply until there are three or even four to choose from down every corridor. A huge pair of scissors lies menacingly on a bench. You think you know your way round the maze, but there is this mounting unease. Have you been everywhere, where are you, what have you missed (in art, as in life)? And this is how it goes through the whole show. You move from this vast labyrinth to a narrow stairwell where the sleeping bag has become a stone sarcophagus for the unknown dead. At the top of the stairs, the scale shifts again and a doorway frames a colossal vista of bunkers marooned in a desert of sand as it if were a panoramic painting. But two dimensions turn into three as you enter a winding tunnel that leads to another darkroom, where the prints show scenes of long ago (except that some seem oddly familiar) and you find yourself inside that very bunker looking back to where you perhaps once stood. But the walls are too high: memory, and agency, blocked. My sense is of a greater freedom by far to Nelson’s art in this enthralling show. Previous installations have been reconfigured beyond recognition, tendentious clues removed. The work feels open to the limits of our imagination. You don’t have to know that the US land artist Robert Smithson is invoked in that buried building to feel the amazement of a gallery silted up with sand, the bunker projecting like the Statue of Liberty in Planet of the Apes. A room only has to contain a prayer stool positioned at a particular angle to be more pressurised than peaceful. And even when a scene appears to have a focused backstory – a pilot’s jacket, a roulette wheel, a chair knocked to the floor – the time, place and action are all in your gift. You are both dramatist and audience. The largest of these environments is conceived like hundreds of open rebar cells through which you perceive life-size sculpted heads: a thinking space. The smallest is a recreation of Nelson’s old studio, strewn with junk like the workshop of a nutter. But it is from all this stuff that he has so diligently constructed these chambers of the mind that put you on the spot with their irresistible enigmas. And what counts is the way in which these fictions are not just conjured from real fragments, but gibe with reality itself. It seems like a dream but you really were there, touching the Venetian doors, the Nairobi snowglobe. Nelson’s worlds partake of a reality they also invent. There is never an idle moment in David Hockney’s art, projected in all its spectacular radiance across every surface of London’s new four-storey Lightroom. Images stream, zoom and scintillate, proliferating in dazzling dayglo, flooding floor and walls with luminous rain, glowing moons and the diagrammatic ripples of his magnificent LA pools. The viewer is spellbound and dwarfed. His graphic genius lends itself perfectly to digital manipulation. The vast Grand Canyon paintings, nuclear orange, now expand all around you. The sharp portraits of Californian collectors loom like living giants in the fizzing sun. A road movie shows Hockney hurtling through the Californian hills to Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries, then it’s a quick splash to the arrival of spring in Normandy, in gargantuan iPad drawings that record every moment of their own making. Unlike the immersive Van Gogh or Kahlo experiences – to which this is enormously superior – Hockney is present throughout as a disembodied voice giving what amounts to a 360° lantern-lecture. Old chestnuts about single-point perspective and the camera obscura alternate, across 50 minutes, with avuncular injunctions to love life and look harder, as he (of course) does. Yet Hockney’s still images generally flick past much too fast for such attention. Which may be why, paradoxically, the most absorbing moments come through the creative team’s animations of his art. A Chinese scroll unfurls slowly around the walls. Theatre curtains gradually rise to reveal dancing figures. A single line, exquisitely inflected, extends into a whole blue ocean. The sight is magical, a digital feat, and then swiftly gone. Perfectly apt for late Hockney, ever the restless techno-pioneer. Star ratings (out of five) Mike Nelson ★★★★★ David Hockney: Bigger and Closer ★★★★ Mike Nelson is at the Hayward Gallery, London until 7 May David Hockney: Bigger and Closer is at Lightroom, London until 4 June"

                    "headline": "Capitol Hill finds rare bipartisan cause in China – but it could pose problems",
                    "bodyText": "In the weeks since the US military shot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon, Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill have spoken passionately about the need to more effectively compete with Beijing. A resolution condemning China for the balloon incident passed the House in an unanimous vote of 419 to 0. Joe Biden has similarly expressed hope that efforts to strengthen America’s global competitiveness in response to a rising China can unite Democrats and Republicans in an era defined by bitter partisanship. “Today, we’re in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the world,” Biden said in his State of the Union address earlier this month. “Let’s be clear: winning the competition with China should unite all of us.” The new House select committee on China will hold its first primetime public hearing on Tuesday, and the panel’s supporters are optimistic its work will provide a rare opportunity for bipartisan cooperation in the divided Congress. But while there’s widespread agreement among policymakers and lawmakers in Washington over the need to better compete with China, there is no prevailing consensus on how to do so. Some experts also fear this kumbaya moment in Washington could escalate tensions with Beijing and increase the risk of conflict. “There is a bipartisan consensus on the fact that China poses a broad challenge to the United States across multiple domains,” said Patricia Kim, an expert on US-China relations at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. “I don’t believe we have a clear consensus on the precise mix of policies that are necessary to address this challenge.” A committee walks the ‘fine line’ One of Republican Kevin McCarthy’s first major victories after securing the House speakership (on the 15th ballot) was to create a new select committee examining competition between the US and China. The motion to form the committee was overwhelmingly approved in a 365 to 65 vote, with 146 Democrats joining all Republicans. “I’ve heard my colleagues on both sides say that the threat posed by Communist China is serious. I fully agree. This is an issue that transcends our political parties,” McCarthy said. The panel, officially named the House select committee on strategic competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist party, is broadly charged with examining a host of economic, security and human rights issues involving China. The panel will be led by congressman Mike Gallagher, a Republican of Wisconsin and prominent “China hawk”, who emphasized that it would work in a bipartisan fashion to expose the threats the CCP poses to US national security and economic interests. Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat of Illinois, will serve as the committee’s ranking member. The leaders have stressed that the target of their scrutiny is China’s ruling party, not its people, and hope their work yields policy and legislative recommendations that win support from lawmakers of both parties. Of course, partisan divisions will arise. Republicans increasingly depict China as an outright “adversary” intent on reshaping the international order while the the Biden administration and many Democrats have treaded more delicately, describing it as “our most consequential strategic competitor”. Republicans have repeatedly attacked Biden over his approach to Beijing, though members of both parties criticized the president’s handling of the balloon incident with some lawmakers accusing the White House of concealing information. And there have also been partisan disagreements about how the US should engage China over shared challenges such as the climate crisis. At the same time, some of the rhetoric from Gallagher and his Republican colleagues has alarmed Democratic members of the committee. Congressman Andy Kim, a Democrat of New Jersey, voiced concern after McCarthy and Gallagher co-signed a Fox News op-ed outlining a strategy to “win the new cold war” against China. “If Chair Gallagher keeps talking about this as a ‘new cold war’, that is not helpful,” Kim told NBC News. “There’s a fine line between deterrence and provocation, and you are crossing over that in a way that is only going to inflame and create greater escalatory challenges.” And there is fear that language casting China as America’s enemy will encourage anti-Asian sentiment amid a surge in hate incidents. “I have a lot of respect for Mike Gallagher in terms of how he’ll conduct the committee in a serious way, but it’s important to see how the conversations unfold,” committee member Ro Khanna, a Democrat of California, told the Guardian. “For those of us who are concerned about not devolving into a cold war or anti-Asian American sentiment, we have to be particularly vocal.” A transition is under way Over the last decade, as the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, consolidated power at home, hope in Washington of improving US-China relations dimmed. Under Xi’s rule, the US has accused China of committing genocide against the Uyghurs and other Turkic and Islamic minority people in the country’s Xinjiang province. Xi has meanwhile overseen an expansive military buildup. This month, the Pentagon informed Congress that China now had more missile silos than the US, though the US has a much larger nuclear force than China. Amid rising fears of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a self-governed island that Beijing claims as its own, the US military has expanded its presence in Asia. Just this month, the US gained expanded access to four military bases in the Philippines. Meanwhile, US lawmakers, including former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, have enraged Beijing with visits to Taiwan in a show of support for the island’s democracy. Gallagher and Khanna made official trips to the capital city of Taipei this month for meetings with top political, national security and business leaders. The discovery of the suspected Chinese spy balloon sparked a diplomatic crisis that resulted in the cancellation of a long-planned trip to Beijing by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Just weeks prior, a top US military commander warned officers in a memo that his “gut” told him the US and China would be at war by 2025. Now US officials say China is considering supplying lethal weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine. China denies the claim, though that didn’t stop the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, from telling CNN on Sunday that it would be “a bad mistake” for Chinese officials to do that. “China should want no part of it,” Sullivan said. In a sign of lawmakers’ hardening views on China, measures to confront Beijing on multiple fronts now routinely attract bipartisan support. Last year, Congress overwhelmingly approved sweeping legislation aimed at growing the nation’s domestic manufacturing and technology sectors to try to boost US competitiveness with China. Shortly thereafter, Biden introduced export restrictions on semiconductors in an effort to strangle China’s microchip sector. Congress also gave the Biden administration new authority to send Taiwan weapons, though lawmakers say a spending dispute is slowing efforts to help the self-governing island fortify its defenses against China. Meanwhile, there is growing support for legislation that would ban the Chinese-owned video sharing platform TikTok that lawmakers say poses a security risk, as well as for efforts to hold China accountable over the country’s alleged abuses of Muslim minorities in its Xinjiang province. The US is turning from a strategy of integration with China to one of confrontation and competition, said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The sharp erosion in relations between the world’s largest economies, underscored by calls for an economic “decoupling”, has left multinational companies scrambling to adapt to the new geopolitical reality. “It’s a very fraught environment for companies to operate in,” Kennedy said. “They’ve become careful to a fault.” Yet despite the rising tensions, he noted that the countries’ economies remain highly interdependent. Last year, trade between the US and China reached a record high of nearly $700bn. Bipartisanship without consensus As US policymakers intensify their efforts to reorient the relationship between China and the US, critical questions remain about what that strategy will look like in practice. There is broad agreement that the US must decrease its reliance on Chinese-made goods and technologies, said Kim, the Brookings expert, but “there certainly isn’t a consensus on how much de-risking and decoupling is necessary to strike the right balance between national security concerns and upholding American values and principles that have long held dear the free flow of information, people, trade and open markets”. The House panel begins its work at a time of rising public hostility toward China. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, 82% of Americans hold an unfavorable view of the country, more than twice the figure in 2012, when Xi came to power. In general, Republicans, more so than Democrats, tend to harbor more negative views of China and are more likely to support the US taking a more hardline approach to the country, it found. The committee’s hearings, meanwhile, will play out against the backdrop of a presidential campaign cycle, with Republicans already aiming to cast Biden as “weak” on China. Amid this heated political environment, some experts have emphasized the importance of avoiding a drumbeat to war with China. Matt Duss, a former foreign policy adviser to the progressive senator Bernie Sanders, complimented Biden’s overall handling of the balloon incident, but he admonished the administration’s “overreaction” in canceling Blinken’s trip. “The American people are going to take cues from their leaders on these issues,” said Duss, who is now a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “That makes it even more important for the administration and for others not to signal hysteria.” The US will soon mark 20 years since the invasion of Iraq, Duss noted; that vastly consequential and widely criticised decision was supported by members of both parties at the time. “Bipartisanship is good,” Duss said. “But bipartisanship behind bad policy is very bad.”"

                    "bodyText": "It was Joe Biden’s week. His energised performance in Kyiv and Warsaw recalled the campaigning style of a much younger man. Russian media sniped that the US president was warming up for his 2024 re-election campaign. They missed the point. He almost certainly intends to run again. Yet last week’s adrenaline rush had a different cause. Biden has cast himself as a latter-day Lionheart, leading a global crusade against the bad guys – what he calls “a test for the ages”. He’s on a high. He believes he, and the cause of democracy, are winning hands down. Sadly, he’s wrong. By “bad guys”, Biden means, principally, Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin, whose delusional speech in Moscow confirmed him as undisputed heir to Ronald Reagan’s evil empire. But Biden is also rhetorically targeting authoritarians, autocrats and tyrants everywhere – anyone who challenges the western democratic model. This includes governments ruling at least half of humanity, such as China and India and many African states. Biden’s division of the world into “for us or against us” camps carries uncomfortable echoes of George W Bush, circa 2001, and of Putin himself. That it is America’s manifest destiny (updated version) to defend and promote freedom and democracy everywhere is a message that normally plays well with US voters. At least, it did once, during the cold war with the Soviet Union, when Biden’s worldview was formed. No more. Despite Putin’s aggressive imperial irredentism, that era has passed. Today’s fractured, fragmented world is multipolar and geopolitically complex. After Afghanistan and Iraq, many Americans ask why the US continues to assume the burdens and responsibilities of global leadership, as unthinkingly advocated by politicians of Biden’s generation. The next president, Democrat or Republican, may take a less expansive, inward-looking view. Biden is the last of his ilk. If that’s true, then the bold pledges he made in Warsaw may last only as long as Biden himself. It’s a worrying thought that Europe’s security hinges on the views, however passionately held, of a frail, 80-year-old man who could soon be replaced by an unknown – or heaven forfend, Donald Trump. It’s a powerful argument for greater self-sufficiency. Biden has become Europe’s one-man buffer. But he’s an old buffer. He may fail. “The war in Ukraine is about power and the principle of territorial sovereignty, and whether the [US-led] western-designed global order ... will survive new challenges from Moscow and Beijing. But it is increasingly a contest between two ageing cold warriors, one 70 years old [Putin] and another who just turned 80,” the New York Times noted. Even assuming Biden is fighting fit, plenty of voters still think he should throw in the towel. That’s not because they dislike him (though many do) but because they think he is just too old. He would be 86 at the end of a second term. Friends point out that Biden mostly fought the 2020 campaign sitting down, closeted in his Delaware basement because of pandemic restrictions. Next year’s heavyweight contest will be infinitely more physically taxing. Columnist Michelle Goldberg believes Biden should quit while he’s ahead. “Biden has been a great president. He’s made good on an uncommon number of campaign promises. He should be celebrated ... But he should not run again,” she wrote. In one recent poll, 78% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents approved of Biden’s performance, yet 58% wanted a new face next year. Analyst Ezra Klein said Biden had surprised everyone by limiting Republican gains and defeating pro-Trump Maga (“Make America great again”) extremists in November’s midterms. Perhaps he could do it again in 2024. He had also succeeded in getting out from under the shadow of Barack Obama, to whom he played second fiddle for eight long years. Yet while Biden may have escaped his past at home, not so abroad. Like Obama, he is overly cautious. His excessive concern that supplying the best weaponry and air defences to Kyiv could provoke Putin has resulted in vast, avoidable destruction in Ukraine. Taiwan still lacks the strategic clarity and weapons required to repel a Chinese invasion. Biden’s nuclear diplomacy with Iran has failed. Israel-Palestine is a policy vacuum where bad things happen. His Afghanistan withdrawal was a shameful disaster. When it comes to what he regards as the most consequential fight of all – for global freedoms, laws and values – Biden is losing ground across the board. “The democracies of the world have grown stronger ... The autocrats of the world have grown weaker,” he declared in Warsaw. Truly? Ukraine has survived, so far, but what of next-door Belarus, where the west watched as pro-democracy activists were crushed? What of Myanmar, where a Beijing-backed junta commits daily crimes against humanity? Think, too, of Hong Kong, where free speech is a fond memory, and of the repressed peoples of Xinjiang, Kashmir, Nicaragua, Venezuela, the West Bank, Syria, Yemen, Tigray, Mali, Cambodia and other democratic black holes where the US (and its allies) have failed to act, looked the other way – or been actively complicit. This is the alternative, anti-freedom narrative of Biden’s watch. This is also the complicated reality of a world split many ways, between not always united democracies, Russia and China (separately or in combination), and the rising 21st-century powers of the global south that do not adhere to 18th-century Euro-Atlantic values, Chinese-style collectivism or old-school Soviet totalitarianism. The whole idea of the west successfully waging a universal, modern-day democracy crusade – or second cold war – is deaf to history, blind to change, surreptitiously neo-imperialist. More to the point, it’s a losing proposition. Biden means well. But he’s showing his age. His florid, outdated “us and them” rhetoric is a geopolitical dead end. The world has moved on. Like his Russian sparring partner, Biden hasn’t. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

                    "headline": "Boris Johnson’s insights are worth £2.5m. Pity we couldn’t have had them while he was PM",
                    "bodyText": "It’s what any caring billionaire half longs for, half dreads: the moment his charge takes the first, faltering steps from dependence towards self-sufficiency. For Lord Bamford, who with his wife has been supporting Boris Johnson with everything from a free wedding to country and town houses, there will inevitably be worries that their protege is not quite ready to stand on his own two feet. Of course, it’s adorable that the recently struggling politician feels able, according to recent reports, to buy a £4m house with a moat for his latest family, but it’s also natural if his benefactors – Bamford not being the only such philanthropist – fear that the notionally sitting MP might one day overtax the patience of the international speaking circuit. Johnson recently signed up, with an advance of £2.5m, to the Harry Walker Agency in New York. The agency is presumably familiar with Jeremy Vine’s immortal description of their talent’s deliberately shambolic performances, probably best received when his audiences were financiers and drunk. Maybe sober US audiences will also enjoy the routine where Johnson pretends to forget who he’s addressing, then pretends to forget the punchline to his own joke. But can even exceptional gullibility on the part of corporate clients guarantee the Johnsons their new independence, minus protectors, distant relations offering loans? It will obviously help if potential customers never see Johnson’s “Peppa Pig” speech to the CBI, featuring his own rhetorical rule of three – “forgive me”, “forgive me”, “forgive me” – and trademark audience involvement: “Hands up if you’ve been to Peppa Pig World!” Given that neither colossal misjudgment nor occasional muteness damaged the US speaking prospects of those unlikely entertainers David Cameron and Theresa May, it may be that foreign audiences won’t mind about, if they’re even aware of, Johnson’s workplace priapism and prodigious lying. Actually, those qualities might be of less concern to the average US business convention than the discovery that their company’s chosen British loser is one whose legendary oratorical skills were exposed from the beginning of his premiership as first dismal, then excruciating and, by the end, non-existent. The threadbare nature of his last speeches – “them’s the breaks”; “hasta la vista, baby” – could not more perfectly have matched the derelict state of his leadership. If marginally less likely to stupefy international audiences than his predecessors, Johnson could well become the first to insult them, whether directly or with clowning or nursery allusions, showing he thinks them too stupid to realise that these represent his entire understanding. His last set piece, at the Sizewell nuclear plant, began: “Now, when I was a child, I had a wonderful book – a much-thumbed Ladybird book called The Story of Nuclear Power.” And, you know what, he feels the same about nuclear power today. Long before he quoted Kermit the Frog at the UN general assembly, British audiences were aware that Johnson’s inability to match his language to the occasion was not so much clumsiness, more a moral failure to stop showing off. Not once in the pandemic did he respond with appropriate feeling and dignity; rather, public suffering was a hook for gags – “Operation Last Gasp”, “squash the sombrero” – or his other speciality, bellicose hyperbole. In fact, Ukraine came along just when Johnson would have been missing the pandemic’s pretexts for what he fancied to be Churchillian exhortation. “Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour.” “Mr Johnson is sought after for his illuminating insights on global security, the world economy and his continued work supporting freedom around the world,” says the Harry Walker Agency. It’s one way of describing turns likely to feature a cartoon character, a tale showcasing his own eccentricity, unfettered boasting, a few insults and some all-purpose noises to the effect that, regardless of the facts, the future is glorious. Will the US agency be supervising him? Because without some equivalent of the Foreign Office staff who stopped Johnson embarrassing himself (James Bond was not born in Estoril) or slighting his hosts (“No. Not appropriate”), the Bamfords should perhaps not assume they are done with caring responsibilities. Already, a favourite, much-rehearsed Johnson anecdote about comical Indian dancing hand-movements (“lightbulb, lightbulb, motorbike, motorbike”) – first aired in a Spectator diary (that also featured a Chinese woman’s “velly solly”) – seems to have been coolly received by Indians present, last November, at the Hindustan Times leadership summit. Johnson fee: £261,652. Days later, the financier Mike Bloomberg apologised to guests at Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore after Johnson described China as “coercive autocracy” to around 500 Asian business people, investors and diplomats. “Some may have been insulted or offended last night by parts of the speaker’s remarks,” Bloomberg said. “The presentation was meant as after-dinner entertainment rather than serious discussion of important controversial and complex issues.” And there was, to be fair, a hilarious section when Johnson condemned those showing “a candid disregard for the rule of international law”, also countries whose “disastrous mistakes” have “demonstrated the immense limitations of their political systems”. Frustratingly for bookers keen to hire this promising rival to Matt Hancock, Gavin Williamson, Lee “Caino” Cain and other Covid-era performers, Johnson’s office insists that he is – whatever Bloomberg said – a highly serious and important statesman: “He will continue to make the case for freedom and democracy on the world stage.” The difficulties already obvious with this plan could explain why Johnson is now making a such nuisance of himself, almost as if he really does plan to boomerang back from a home-moat and £32,000 an hour to a prime minister’s salary and a Lulu Lytle begging bowl. Whether it’s by showily pronouncing on the Northern Ireland deal or styling himself lonely saviour of Ukraine, Johnson needs these gestures to prove to international clients what he forgot to demonstrate in office – that he’s all grown up. • Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

                    "headline": "Thousands protest in Berlin against giving weapons to Ukraine",
                    "bodyText": "Thousands of people have taken part in a demonstration in central Berlin to protest against giving more weapons to Ukraine, urging the German government to deescalate the crisis by paving the way for negotiations with Vladimir Putin instead. Police estimated there were 13,000 people at the Uprising for Peace, at the Brandenburg Gate, organised by Sahra Wagenknecht, a renegade member of the Left party, and veteran feminist campaigner Alice Schwarzer. The organisers claimed as many as 50,000 took part. Similar demonstrations took place in other German cities. In a speech at the protest, Wagenknecht spoke of “the start of a citizens’ initiative” and a “starting signal for a new, strong peace movement in Germany”. She said the demonstrators had been united by the fact they did not feel represented by the government of Olaf Scholz and his foreign minister Annalena Baerbock over their decision to provide Ukraine with weapons. Protesters carried banners reading: ‘Helmets today, tanks tomorrow, the day after tomorrow your sons,” in reference to the manner in which the coalition government has increased its military support for Kyiv, initially donating 5,000 helmets and more recently agreeing to send German-made Leopard II tanks. Other banners read: “Diplomaten statt Grenaten (Diplomats instead of grenades)”, “Stop the Killing” and “Not My War, Not My Government”. “We are like the slaves to war and the warmongers,” said Norbert, a former soldier, declining to give his surname, who held a banner reading “The real enemy sits in the City of London and New York,” a reference he said to the financial powers who he claimed were behind the war and had no interest in it ending. Germany, he said, had no right to participate in another war, after the second world war. One man held a banner on which he said people had been numbed into accepting the war by the sedative effects of the coronavirus vaccine. Around the demonstration, loudspeakers blasted peace songs such as John Lennon’s Imagine and Nena’s 99 Red Balloons. A woman called Edith, carrying a large portrait of the Indian revolutionary Mahatma Gandhi, said: “We should follow his example of nonviolent resistance to bring an end to this madness.” Elsewhere, other nearby demonstrations showed sympathy for Ukraine, with banners reading: “Stop Putin’s War” and “Help Ukraine Defend Itself”. A poster held by a group of anti-fascist demonstrators pointed out how Wagenknecht had put warnings of a Russian invasion of Ukraine down to media propaganda, stating in a TV broadcast on 20 February, 2022: “We can be happy that Putin is not like he is presented as being, namely a crazy Russian nationalist who is intoxicated with the idea of shifting borders. If that was the case, then negotiations would probably be pointless.” A group of Ukrainians wrapped in their country’s flag outside the nearby Russian embassy held up posters and slogans including, “Not delivering weapons to Ukraine is the equivalent to genocide support”. Roman Overko, from the Ukrainian city of Lviv who now lives in Berlin, said: “The idea of negotiating is naive. How do you negotiate with such enemies of humanity? You can’t talk to them like normal people. Putin is a second Hitler.” Yevhen Titarenko, a Ukrainian film director in Berlin to present his documentary Eastern Front, shot on the frontline with a volunteer medics battalion, said before the demonstration: “The demonstrators say they are pacifists. Well, I’m a pacifist too. But imagine someone’s trying to blow your doors down, if you don’t shoot back, they’ll just kill you, take all you have, rape your wife, kill your children. To make an agreement with a clinically mad old guy makes no sense.” Baerbock was singled out at the demonstration as the government member with the most responsibility for drawing Germany deeper into the conflict. Participants angrily shouted “Baerbock raus” – or Baerbock out – during and at the end of Wagenknecht’s address. Scholz and the pro-business FDP’s Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, head of the Bundestag defence committee, who has pressured the government to deliver more military support, were also criticised. Wagenknecht said her main motivation was to bring to an end the “terrible suffering and dying in Ukraine”. But that meant offering Russia negotiations, she said, “instead of a never-ending war of attrition with ever newer weapons”. She said her childhood fears of a nuclear war in the 1980s had been revived by the current conflict. The risk of the expansion of the war across Europe and possibly the world was “very big”. Two weeks ago Wagenknecht and Schwarzer had published a “Manifest for Peace” in which they urged Chancellor Scholz to “stop the escalation in weapons deliveries”. It has so far been signed by about 650,000 people, including prominent intellectuals and political figures. They had been criticised in recent days after suggesting that “anyone whose heart beat for peace” would be welcome to the demonstration, after far-right groups expressed their desire to attend. On Twitter, the far-right populist AfD party posted a picture of Jörg Urban, its chairman for Saxony, at the Brandenburg Gate, next to the symbol of a dove of peace, stating: “A year after the start of the war we finally need serious efforts towards peace negotiations instead of more escalation!” It added it was “alarming” that those who called for peace were being discredited as traitors. Jürgen Elsässer, editor-in-chief of Compact, a magazine directly representing the AfD, was also present. Police intervened at the start of the demonstration to break up a scuffle as anti-fascist demonstrators tried to exclude him and his entourage. The leadership of Wagenknecht’s own party, Die Linke, distanced themselves from the event. The Social Democrats’ Katja Mast accused the organisers of “serving Russian propaganda”. Christian Lindner, the finance minister, condemned the rally, saying: “Those who don’t stand at Ukraine’s side are standing on the false side of history”. • This article was amended on 26 February 2023. In an earlier version, Germany’s Die Linke (the Left) party was incorrectly named as the “Links party”."

                    "headline": "Australia’s defence force faces once in a generation shake-up – but to what purpose?",
                    "bodyText": "As the Australian government considers the biggest defence shake-up in nearly four decades, it faces a blunt warning from a key strategist. Australia’s security outlook has worsened substantially, warns the former defence official Paul Dibb, who carried out the landmark 1985-86 defence review for the then Hawke government. He believes the structure of the Australian defence force needs a significant overhaul to match the times. “We need to prepare ourselves for a very different and much more threatening strategic environment,” says Dibb, an emeritus professor at the Australian National University who remains well connected with the defence establishment. As the Albanese government prepares to invest more in long-range missiles and vast sums on nuclear-powered submarines, it has said the current Defence Strategic Review – which was handed to the government earlier this month – “should be seen in the same light as the Dibb review back in 1985-86 – it’s as significant as that”. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Dibb calls for the Australian defence force to focus on maritime strike capabilities. He also suggests a “serious historical and cultural change” for the army in this new environment. And he warns of the risk of “high-intensity conflict from a country starting with C and ending with A but isn’t Cambodia or Canada or Cuba”. A very different world China’s military capabilities have expanded substantially since the then defence minister Kim Beazley commissioned the Dibb review 38 years ago. Back then, Dibb’s report described Australia as “one of the most secure countries in the world” as it was “distant from the main centres of global military confrontation, and it is surrounded by large expanses of water which make it difficult to attack”. In the 1986 report, he proposed a strategy of “denial” that would “allow our geography to impose long lines of communication on an adversary and force an aggressor to consider the ultimate prospect of fighting on unfamiliar and generally inhospitable terrain”. Key to this was ensuring an enemy would have substantial difficulty in crossing the sea and air gap. He called for ground forces to focus on light mobile operations in the north rather than forces involving armoured and mechanised operations and heavier artillery. At that time, Dibb noted Australia’s neighbours possessed only limited capabilities to project military power against it. He assessed that a global war between superpowers – meaning the then Soviet Union and the US – was “most unlikely and provides no basis for planning our force structure” – but warned that “it would not be prudent to assume that we will always be able to conduct our affairs without challenge”. The 1985-86 review accepted the prevailing strategic view that it would take at least 10 years for the development of a regional capacity to threaten Australia with substantial assault. That was officially junked nearly three years ago, when the Coalition’s defence strategic update concluded the risk of conflict was growing and Australia could no longer depend on a warning time of at least 10 years. Dibb says that since the arrival of Xi Jinping as president, China has more assertively pressed its claims to the vast majority of the South China Sea, despite competing claims from other countries including Vietnam and the Philippines, and has built up military outposts on artificially constructed islands. Dibb also cites “the stepping up last year of Chinese military aggression against Taiwan”, some dangerous close encounters between the People’s Liberation Army and the ADF, and the economic pressure Beijing sought to apply against Australia through trade measures. He says defence planners must take seriously the possibility of Chinese bases with military potential being established to Australia’s north and north-east. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Dibb now advocates a policy of “deterrence by denial”, whereby Australia develops the capability to attack an adversary’s forces and any of the associated infrastructure directly threatening Australia. This would depend on the possession of highly credible accurate, long-range missile strike capabilities. Together with Richard Brabin-Smith, an honorary professor in strategic and defence studies at the ANU, Dibb wrote in a paper that this concept was distinct from the much more demanding and expensive concept of “deterrence through punishment”, which involves attacking the adversary’s territory. They wrote: “In any case, the idea of Australia being able to inflict unacceptable punishment on a big power such as China would be ridiculous. The bottom line for defence policy is that, as confidence in deterrence by denial goes up, our dependence on early response to warnings should go down.” All at sea So what does this mean for the review carried out by the former defence chief Angus Houston and former Labor defence minister Stephen Smith? “We need to refocus the ADF – and this is a non-trivial issue – so it is essentially a maritime strike capability,” Dibb says. “By maritime I don’t just mean at sea or under the sea. I mean over the sea, with long-range strike missiles and long-range strike air force capabilities. The implications of that are that we need lots of long-range strike weapons – and we need to get a wriggle on. We have very few weapons in stockpile.” The aim, Dibb says, is to deny any potential adversary into not just Australia’s close coastal areas, but into its strategic approaches out to a couple of thousand kilometres. “The real test for this review will be to say to army: you’re no longer going to be structured for fighting wars like Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and the Middle East, you actually have got to stop thinking about spending $27bn on infantry fighting vehicles,” he says. Scrapping the project to acquire up to 450 infantry fighting vehicles would trigger controversy within the army, which has argued it needs a replacement for Australia’s Vietnam war-era armoured personnel carriers. Army figures have also warned against being too confident about predicting future wars. But Dibb continues: “The new role for army in my view demands a serious historical and cultural change in the army leadership and that is, they should be equipped with trucks that have highly precise long-range strike missiles on them. You deploy them when necessary, to the north of Australia, on the big C-17s. “The risk for army is when you launch a long-range precise strike missile at the incoming adversary’s warships, for instance, you are then very vulnerable yourself to highly precise enemy weapon systems. You pack up the truck, put them in the C-17 and helter-skelter somewhere else.” Dibb says this is the kind of role that the US marines in the Pacific now see themselves having, including on the Japanese islands. “The other role for army – equally novel and demanding – will be: why not give them the role for integrated air defence including missile air defence of our airfields, our ports, and our central military capabilities which should be hardened? That would be a dramatic change in role for the army.” ‘Impactful projection’ None of this will be easy. Dibb played a major part in the writing of the subsequent 1987 defence white paper and then served as deputy secretary of the Department of Defence from 1988 to 1991, but recounts facing some institutional resistance when it came to actually implementing the plans. Dibb says acting on the looming Houston-Smith review is going to be a test for the Albanese government – but it will also be a test for the opposition. “It should be bipartisan. And if I’m right about what the priorities are, including for army, I would be bitterly disappointed if Peter Dutton played some political games.” The defence minister, Richard Marles, has signalled that he is prepared to wind back existing programs in order to fund higher priorities, even against a backdrop of rising defence spending overall (it currently sits around 2% of gross domestic product). In a hint of where he is going, Marles says Australia needs to think about “how we hold any potential adversary at risk at greater distance from our shores”. He has used the phrase “impactful projection”. Tom Corben, a research fellow in the foreign policy and defence program at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, thinks this “really refers to Australia’s ability to project military force from the homeland or from Australia’s immediate region further into Asia, through means like long-range strike, through things like submarines, through things like autonomous systems and long-range aircraft”. “I think it means value as well – not simply projecting force to ‘show the flag’ and show that we have interests in stake in the region, but to be credible in those projections of force and our ability not only to act on them in the first instance if we need to, but to sustain that action if it came to it,” Corben says. He expects to see a relative shift in emphasis from simply defending the Australian continent – which will still remain a planning priority – towards the wider region. That reflects “a perception that the key challenges to Australia’s regional interests lie out in the region itself”. Corben says the strategy seeks to “make it as costly as possible for China to seize control of contested or disputed land features or oceans by force, whether that be around Taiwan or in the South China Sea or elsewhere”. “I think what we want to ensure in the region is that the rules for how interstate relations are conducted, how territorial disagreements and control are resolved, how trade is conducted – we want all of those things to be worked out in an environment where power doesn’t disproportionately affect the outcome of those negotiations, or the threat of the use of military, political or economic coercion against a smaller state – to ensure the bigger powers don’t win out simply because they’re bigger,” Corben says. “That’s more or less the kind of situation that Australia wants to avoid, because it is under more open conditions that Australian interests in the region have thrived in the last couple of decades.”"

                    "bodyText": "Good evening, we will now be closing this live blog. You can read more of our Russia-Ukraine war coverage here. A protest in Berlin against sending weapons to Ukraine drew 10,000 people on Saturday, Reuters reports. The “Uprising for Peace” was held around the Brandenburg Gate in central Berlin, a day after the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The event was partly organised by politician Sahra Wagenknecht, a member of Germany’s left-wing Die Linke party. Signs at the protest bore statements such as “Negotiate, not escalate” and “Not our war”. The demonstration’s website reads: “We call on the German chancellor to stop the escalation of arms deliveries. Now!...Because every day lost costs up to 1,000 more lives - and brings us closer to a 3rd world war.” Police deployed 1,400 officers to keep the peace and enforce bans on military uniforms, Russian and Soviet flags, Russian military songs and right-wing symbols. A police spokesperson said the protest was peaceful and there was no sign of right-wing groups in attendance. German finance minister Christian Lindner reacted to the demonstration by tweeting: “Whoever does not stand by Ukraine is on the wrong side of history.” Hungary has indicated a further possible delay in ratifying Finland and Sweden’s bid for Nato membership, as Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’s chief of staff said a vote may take place in the second half of March, Reuters reports. “Parliament will put this on the agenda on Monday and start debating the legislation next week,” Gergely Gulyas, Orbán’s aide, told a press conference. “Based on Hungarian procedure, adopting legislation takes about four weeks, so it follows that parliament can have a vote on this sometime in the second half of March, on the week of March 21.” The ratification process has been stalled in Hungary’s parliament since July. A legislative agenda published this week on the parliament’s website indicated a final vote on the Nato applications could occur on the week of March 6. On Friday, Orbán aired concerns from ruling party lawmakers, including what he described as Finland and Sweden spreading “outright lies” about the health of democracy and rule of law in Hungary. Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, said on Saturday that Wagner fighters captured the village of Yahidne, north of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, Reuters reported. Reuters could not independently confirm the statement, which Prigozhin had made in a short audio message. After six months of heavy fighting, Ukrainian forces were reported to have blown up a bridge near Bakhmut this month in a possible sign of retreat, a move that would give Russia a significant boost. Ukraine has denied it intends to leave Bakhmut. Its’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Three civilians have been wounded by Russian artillery shelling of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, a senior Ukrainian official said. In a separate Telegram, the Kherson regional military administration said two emergency and rescue workers had been injured by Russian shelling. Russian troops on the east bank of the Dnieper River opened fire on Kherson region 83 times on Friday, hitting 34 settlements, according to the head of the regional military administration. Explosions have reportedly been heard in the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine, according to Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the exiled city’s mayor. The explosions were reported in the location of a large Russian military personnel cluster, he said. “It’s a good trend,” he added. Ukraine’s armed forces have in recent days claimed strikes on Mariupol, previously thought to be outside the effective range of Ukrainian missiles. Russia appears to have run out of its current stock of Iranian-made drones and will seek to resupply, according to the latest update by the UK Ministry of Defence. The MoD said Russia most likely sees the drones as “useful decoys which can divert Ukrainian air defences from more effective Russian cruise missiles”. The EU has agreed to slap a 10th package of sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, just in time for a self-imposed deadline to mark the first anniversary of the war. The latest round of sanctions tackled the banking sector, Russia’s access to technology that can be used for civilian and military purposes, and advanced technologies, the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he expects “decisive steps” against the Russian nuclear industry and the Rosatom corporation, and more pressure on Russia’s military and banking. A meeting of finance chiefs of the Group of 20 (G20) leading economies has ended without a consensus, with Russia and China objecting to the description of the war in Ukraine in a final document. In a statement at the end of the meeting in Bengaluru, the G20 chair India said a statement demanding Russia’s withdrawal from Ukraine was endorsed by all members except Moscow and Beijing. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has dismissed China’s “unrealistic” proposal to end the conflict. Beijing should not “bet on an aggressor who broke [international] law and will lose the war”, Podolyak posted to Twitter. President Zelenskiy has cautiously welcomed China’s peace plan to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but said it would be acceptable only if it led to Vladimir Putin pulling his troops out from all occupied Ukrainian territory. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has said China’s engagement in peace in Ukraine is a “good thing”. Macron told reporters that he would visit China in early April, in part to seek Beijing’s help with ending the war. “China must help us put pressure on Russia so that it never uses chemical or nuclear weapons,” Macron said. The US has intelligence that the Chinese government is considering providing Russia with drones and ammunition for use in the war in Ukraine, according to US officials. It does not appear that Beijing has made a final decision yet and there is no evidence that any weapon transfers have occurred, officials said. However, negotiations between Russia and China about the price and scope of the equipment are ongoing, CNN has reported. Poland’s largest oil company, PKN Orlen, has stopped receiving oil via the Druzhba pipeline from Russia, its chief executive officer, Daniel Obajtek, has said. Orlen said it could fully supply its refineries via sea and that consumers would not be affected by the halt. Russian oil accounts for about 10% of Polish supply after Warsaw cut imports after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year. Joe Biden has also ruled out “for now” sending American advanced fighter jets to Ukraine, telling an interview that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy “doesn’t need F-16s now”. The US president told the ABC on Friday “there is no basis upon which there is a rationale, according to our military now, to provide F-16s” to Ukraine. The president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, said he and Vladimir Putin spoke for a long time on Friday. Lukashenko’s remarks to reporters came as China’s foreign ministry confirmed that the Belarusian leader is expected to visit China on 28 February. A former commander of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has been arrested after allegedly attacking a police officer in Oslo, according to Norwegian prosecutors. Andrey Medvedev, who has been living in Norway in January since he fled from Russia, was allegedly detained in the early hours of Wednesday after a fight outside a bar in the Norwegian capital. Thousands of tickets for the Eurovision song contest are to be allocated to Ukrainians who have been forced from their homes and are living in the UK. The UK government has also announced £10m in funding to “help ensure the event truly showcases Ukrainian culture” on the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of the country. A month-long fundraising drive in Lithuania to buy air defence radars for Ukraine has raised €14m (£12.4m), organisers said. Lithuania, a member of both the EU and Nato, has been a major supporter of Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia last year. In a statement, the Lithuanian president, Gitanas Nausėda, said: At this crucial moment, we must do all that is possible to guarantee our backing for the Ukrainian people. The money raised will be used to buy 14 radars, the organisers said. Lithuanian journalist and volunteer Andrius Tapinas posted to Twitter: 14 000 000 euro from Lithuanians to buy radars to defend Ukraine. In four weeks. That’s it from us. For now. We will be back. My colleague Dan Sabbagh writes that a large crowd has gathered outside the Russian embassy in London, chanting “Putin, stop the war”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he expects “decisive steps” against the Russian nuclear industry and the Rosatom corporation, and more pressure on Russia’s military and banking. His tweet came after the EU’s top diplomats agreed on Friday to slap a 10th package of sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. A former commander of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has been arrested after allegedly attacking a police officer after being arrested outside a bar in Oslo, according to Norwegian prosecutors. Andrey Medvedev, who has been living in Norway in January since he fled from Russia, was detained in the early hours of Wednesday after a fight outside a bar in the Norwegian capital, according to the indictment, seen by AFP. The exact circumstances of the brawl were not specified but, according to the court documents, Medvedev, who was drunk at the time, had resisted arrest and then physically attacked police officers once he arrived at the station. His trial has been set for 25 April. Medvedev, 26, crossed the border into Norway on 13 January, where he applied for asylum. Before fleeing, he said that in Ukraine he had witnessed the summary killing of Wagner fighters accused by their own commanders of disobeying orders, sometimes in pairs. He said he was ready to tell everything he knew about the Wagner group, its activities and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, has said it was “regrettable” that China had blocked a G20 communique to condemn Russia’s war on Ukraine. Lindner, speaking to reporters after a meeting of G20 finance chiefs in India, said: But for me it was more important that all the others adhered to a clear position of international law, multilateralism and the end of the war. All members of the Group of Twenty (G20) wealthy economies, except Russia and China, have agreed to “strongly condemn” Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, India has said after a meeting of G20 financial leaders near Bengaluru. In a statement at the end of the meeting, the G20 chair said the statement demanding Russia’s withdrawal from Ukraine was endorsed by all members except Moscow and Beijing. India stuck to the language used in a declaration last year by G20 leaders in Bali, adding that it recognised that the bloc was not the forum to resolve security issues. At the last major G20 meeting, in November, leaders strongly condemned the war, warning the conflict was intensifying fragilities in the world’s economy. India’s statement today said: The peaceful resolution of conflicts, efforts to address crises, as well as diplomacy and dialogue, are vital. Today’s era must not be of war. An outcome document published today said there was no agreement on the wording of the war in Ukraine. Poland’s largest oil company, PKN Orlen, has stopped receiving oil via the Druzhba pipeline from Russia, its chief executive officer, Daniel Obajtek, has said. Posting to Twitter, Obajtek said: We’re effectively securing supplies. Russia has halted supplies to Poland, for which we are prepared. Orlen said it could fully supply its refineries via sea and that consumers would not be affected by the halt. The Druzhba pipeline, which supplies oil to Poland and Germany, as well as to Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, was exempted from EU sanctions to help countries with limited options for alternative deliveries. Russian oil accounts for about 10% of Polish supply after Warsaw cut imports after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year. Earlier we reported that the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, said he had held a long conversation with Vladimir Putin yesterday. We now have some more detail from Reuters. Lukashenko, a close Putin ally , was quoted as telling reporters earlier today: I’ll tell you a secret, last night he and I spoke for a long time on various topics. The Kremlin has yet to provide any statement about the conversation. Belarus, which shares a border with Ukraine and Russia, allowed Russia a year ago to use its territory as a launchpad for its attack on Ukraine. Earlier this month, Lukashenko said Belarus was ready to do so again. Lukashenko’s remarks came as China’s foreign ministry confirmed that the Belarusian leader is expected to visit China on 28 February. A spokesperson for the ministry said: At the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko will pay a state visit to China from 28 February to 2 March. The EU agreed late on Friday to slap a tenth package of sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, just in time for a self-imposed deadline to mark the first anniversary of the war. Ambassadors met in Brussels after failing to finalise the sanctions package for several days. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, had told Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that the EU aimed to have the measures in place by 24 February. The latest round of sanctions tackled the banking sector, Russia’s access to technology that can be used for civilian and military purposes, and advanced technologies, the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said. Borrell warned that the bloc would continue to apply more sanctions, adding that it would “do it for as long as needed, until Ukraine is liberated from the brutal Russian aggression”. Von der Leyen said the EU was turning up the pressure on those trying to circumvent sanctions. She said: We now have the most far-reaching sanctions ever – depleting Russia’s war arsenal and biting deep into its economy. The sanctions package will add electronic components used in Russian weapons systems retrieved on the battlefield – including drones, missiles, helicopters, as well as specific rare earth materials, electronic integrated circuits and thermal cameras – to the list of banned exports. It also imposes tighter export restrictions on another 96 entities for supporting Russia’s military and industrial complex, including for the first time seven Iranian entities manufacturing military drones used by Moscow. Additional restrictions are imposed on imports of goods which generate significant revenues for Russia, such as asphalt and synthetic rubber. Three civilians have been wounded by Russian artillery shelling of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, a senior Ukrainian official said. Posting to Telegram, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andriy Yermak, wrote: Today, due to artillery shelling of the city of Kherson, three local residents ended up in the hospital. Russian terrorists are fighting the civilian population. In a separate Telegram, the Kherson regional military administration said two emergency and rescue workers had been injured by Russian shelling. The two men suffered shrapnel injuries, it said, adding they had been hospitalised and were receiving medical assistance. Russian troops on the east bank of the Dnipro River opened fire on Kherson region 83 times on Friday, hitting 34 settlements, according to Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the regional military administration. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said he held a long conversation with Vladimir Putin yesterday, Reuters is reporting. Lukashenko told reporters that he and his Russian counterpart touched on various topics in their conversation, without giving further details. Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed some elements of a Chinese proposal for a ceasefire in Russia’s war on Ukraine, but said only the country where a war is being fought can be the initiator of a peace plan. The Ukrainian president said, during a press conference in Kyiv on Friday, that the plan was “an important signal that they are going to participate in this topic”, but warned Beijing against providing Moscow with arms. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has said China’s engagement in peace in Ukraine is a “good thing”. Macron told reporters that he would visit China in early April, in part to seek Beijing’s help with ending the war. He said: China must help us put pressure on Russia so that it never uses chemical or nuclear weapons, (an effort) which China has already made, and that it stops its aggression as a precondition for talks. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the frontline city of Bakhmut in Ukraine. The US has intelligence that the Chinese government is considering providing Russia with drones and ammunition for use in the war in Ukraine, according to US officials. It does not appear that Beijing has made a final decision yet and there is no evidence that any weapon transfers have occurred, officials said. However, negotiations between Russia and China about the price and scope of the equipment are ongoing, CNN has reported. It comes as the Russian army rapidly depletes its ammunition stocks more than a year into its invasion of Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly requested drones and ammunition from Beijing, the sources said, and Chinese leadership has been actively debating over the last several months whether or not to send the lethal aid, they added. US intelligence officials believe China is now leaning towards providing the equipment, despite just yesterday calling for peace talks and urging all parties to end attacks on civilians. The sources said the provision of drones and ammunition would likely be for small arms such as handheld weaponry rather than larger artillery. The aid being considered consists of 122-millimetre and 152-millimetre rounds, which Russia has in dwindling supply as it prosecutes a war largely fought with artillery, the Washington Post has cited US officials as saying. A senior US administration official said: China has the capacity to be a game-changer. If China were to go ahead with the transfer, it would mark the first time Beijing has provided lethal aid in the conflict despite repeated warnings from the US. Joe Biden said on Friday that he does not “anticipate a major initiative” from China to provide weapons to Russia. When asked if any future support would cross a red line, Biden said that the US “would respond.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Sunday said China may be about to provide lethal aid to help Russia in the war in Ukraine. Blinken told US networks that the US had information China was considering whether to give Russia assistance, possibly including guns and weapons, for the Ukraine war. Here’s some more on the G20 meeting in India, where finance leaders of the world’s biggest economies have been unable to reach a consensus on how to describe the conflict in Ukraine. Italy’s finance minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, said it would be “unacceptable” to soften the wording approved in November at the G20 summit in Bali. At the time, G20 leaders said “most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine” but also acknowledged some countries saw the conflict differently. In a statement, Giorgetti said: We cannot call into question what was approved in Bali and any other solution would be an unacceptable setback. A meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the Group of Twenty (G20) leading economies in Bengaluru, India, will likely end today without a joint communique, because there was no consensus on how to describe the conflict in Ukraine, according to delegates. The US and its G7 allies have pushed to demand the communique squarely condemn Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting, US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said: I think there has to be a statement in the communique condemning Russia’s war. It’s something that I think is absolutely necessary. Russia, which is a member of the G20, refers to its actions in Ukraine as a “special military operation”, and avoids calling it an invasion or war. India has been reluctant to be caught between Ukraine’s western allies and Russia and other countries supporting Moscow, such as China. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, kicking off the meetings on Friday, avoided mention of Ukraine. India and China were also among the nations that abstained on a UN vote to call for Russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Ukraine. India is pressing the meeting to avoid using the word “war” in any communique, G20 officials have told Reuters. A senior source said negotiations over the communique were difficult, with Russia and China blocking proposals by western countries. Explosions have reportedly been heard in the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine, according to Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the exiled city’s mayor. The explosions were reported in the location of a large Russian military personnel cluster, he said. Andriushchenko, posting on Telegram, wrote: The sounds of explosions along the line of Yalta village / Yuryivka village (location of a large concentration of occupiers) in Mariupol district are reported. We verify the reports. Air raid alert was announced in Ukraine, but occupiers are struck. “It’s a good trend,” he added. Ukraine’s armed forces have in recent days claimed strikes on Mariupol, previously thought to be outside the effective range of Ukrainian missiles, Kyiv Post has reported. Nataliya Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s armed forces, on Thursay said: At this stage, we can only state that inaccessibility is a very relative concept. What is considered so remote that it is unreachable, is not always so. The direction of Mariupol is no longer completely unreachable for us. Thousands of tickets for the Eurovision song contest are to be allocated to Ukrainians who have been forced from their homes and are living in the UK. The international music show will take place at the M&amp;S Bank Arena Liverpool in May after the city was chosen to host the competition on behalf of the 2022 winner, Ukraine, which is unable to host the event after the Russian invasion. As part of the UK’s commitment to honour Ukraine at the song contest, about 3,000 tickets will be made available to displaced Ukrainians so they can attend the live shows. The UK government has also announced £10m in funding to “help ensure the event truly showcases Ukrainian culture” on the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of the country. The money will support Liverpool city council and the BBC’s partnerships with Ukrainian artists and performers to create a show “celebrating music and how it unites people from around the world”. Read the full story here: Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has dismissed China’s “unrealistic” proposal to end the conflict. Beijing should not “bet on an aggressor who broke [international] law and will lose the war”, Podolyak tweeted this morning. The Chinese government’s 12-point position paper on Ukraine was released on Friday morning, on the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion. In it, Beijing called for peace talks while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians, in a statement which appeared to maintain its stance that the west was fuelling the conflict and which analysts dismissed as anodyne. The paper, for which Ukraine was not consulted, was cautiously welcomed by Kyiv. “China started talking about Ukraine, and that’s not bad,” Zelenskiy said during a press conference yesterday. It seems to me that there is respect for our territorial integrity, security issues. Podolyak said yesterday that any plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine must involve the withdrawal of Moscow’s troops back to Ukraine’s 1991 borders at the time of the Soviet Union’s collapse. The New Voice of Ukraine’s Euan MacDonald has shared a clip showing the formal handover of the first Polish Leopard tanks to Ukraine. The video shows Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, with his Ukrainian counterpart, Denys Shmyhal, attending the official transfer of Polish Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine in an undisclosed location in the country. It comes after Morawiecki yesterday confirmed that four Leopard tanks had been delivered to Ukraine. Standing alongside Volodymyr Zelenskiy during his visit to Kyiv, Morawiecki said: Poland and Europe stand by your side. We will definitely not leave you, we will support Ukraine until complete victory over Russia. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over from Mark Gerts to bring you the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukraine’s military said Russia had doubled the number of ships on active duty in the Black Sea on Friday and predicted this could be a preparation for more missile strikes. Russia’s navy has regularly launched missiles from its Black Sea fleet as part of an effort by Moscow to target Ukrainian critical infrastructure and power-generating facilities. “In the Black Sea, the fleet of warships has doubled compared to this morning – it is now eight ships,” the military command in the southern region said in a Facebook update. “Against a background of enemy aviation activity of a certain kind, this may indicate that a missile attack as well as drone strikes are in preparation,” it said. One of the vessels is a frigate armed with eight Kalibr missiles, it said. Last Saturday Ukraine said Russia launched four Kalibr missiles from the Black Sea, two of which were shot down. Russia’s Black Sea fleet is based in the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014. Ukraine has issued a postage stamp with a reproduction of a Banksy mural, of a boy defeating a grown man in judo, to mark the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion. It was painted by the British street artist on a demolished wall in the town of Borodianka, north-west of Kyiv, where many buildings were reduced to rubble by Russian aircraft at the start of the invasion. The image draws inspiration from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, known to be a black belt in judo, and depicts a young judoka representing Ukraine knocking down a grown man. The phrase “Get lost Putin” has been added to the lower left part of the new stamp. Residents of the capital flocked to buy the new stamps on Friday from Kyiv’s main post office. Svetlana, a 50-year-old economist, was keen to get her hands on one “because I support the Ukrainian armed forces” and “the stamp is printed at a historic moment”, one year after the start of the Russian invasion. Also buying the first-day issue, Maxime said she was delighted to see a “first stamp from one of Banksy’s works”. “It’s a very cool gesture for the world to understand Ukraine, that we remain in the spotlight,” the 26-year-old said. The UN security council held a minute of silence Friday for victims of the war in Ukraine as the secretary general, António Guterres, said Russia’s invasion had devastated the country. “Life is a living hell for the people of Ukraine,” Guterres told the council as it met to mark the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion. The Russian invasion is a blatant violation of the United Nations charter and international law. The war was condemned by most of the members of the security council in a symbolic ministers’ meeting to mark the anniversary. On year ago, Russia “unleashed that war with no other justification than its obsessive desire to resurrect a past”, said the French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said “any peace that legitimises Russia’s seizure of land by force will weaken the charter and send a message to would-be aggressors everywhere that they can invade countries and get away with it”. Yet, one day after the UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to demand Russia withdraw its troops from Ukraine, Moscow’s envoy to the UN remained steadfast in blaming the war on Kyiv and the west. “Ukraine is not a victim,” Vasily Nebenzya said. Kyiv and its allies “left us with no option other than to eliminate threats to Russia from the territory of Ukraine militarily”, he said. Rallies and vigils were held across the world to mark one year since Russia invaded Ukraine. Not up to date with all that’s happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week? Helen Sullivan has handily compiled the Guardian’s must-read news and analysis, here: Joe Biden has also ruled out “for now” sending American advanced fighter jets to Ukraine, telling an interview that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy “doesn’t need F-16s now”. The US president told the ABC on Friday “there is no basis upon which there is a rationale, according to our military now, to provide F-16s” to Ukraine. Asked by interviewer David Muir if that meant “never”, Biden said: “I am ruling it out for now.” “Look, we’re sending [Zelenskiy] what our seasoned military thinks he needs now. He needs tanks, he needs artillery, he needs air defence, including another Himar[s],” Biden said. “There’s things he needs now that we’re sending him to put them in a position to be able to make gains this spring and this summer going into the fall.” Russia appears to have run out of its current stock of Iranian-made drones and will seek to resupply, according to the latest update by the UK Ministry of Defence. The MoD tweeted that Russia most likely sees the drones as “useful decoys which can divert Ukrainian air defences from more effective Russian cruise missiles”. There have not been any reports of Iranian one-way-attack uncrewed aerial vehicles (OWA-UAVs) being used in Ukraine since around 15 February 2023. Prior to this, Ukrainian armed forces reported shooting down at least 24 Shahed-136 OWA-UAVs between late January and early February 2023; and scores were destroyed in the first few days of the year. This lack of OWA-UAV deployments likely indicates that Russia has run down its current stock. Russia will likely seek a resupply. Although the weapons do not have a good record in destroying their intended targets, Russia likely sees them as useful decoys which can divert Ukrainian air defences from more effective Russian cruise missiles. Emmanuel Macron has urged Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to “fight” Russian evasion of western sanctions via Turkey. The French president “underlined the concern of fighting any evasion of the sanctions in place”, his office said, after he spoke to his Turkish counterpart by phone on the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of its neighbour. He added that “pressure on and isolation of Russia must be increased” to force Moscow to “give up” on its attack. Erdoğan has been able to maintain relations with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, by refusing to join western sanctions on Russia and ramping up bilateral trade during the war. The Turkish leader has used his good relations with both Moscow and Kyiv to try to mediate an end to the conflict. Turkey hosted two early rounds of peace talks and helped strike a UN-backed agreement restoring Ukrainian grain deliveries across the Black Sea. Erdoğan has also repeatedly tried to bring Putin and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy to Turkey for truce talks. His office said that he called for a “just peace” in Ukraine in a Friday phone call with Putin. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, will arrive in China on 28 February for a state visit, the Chinese foreign ministry has said. Spokesperson Hua Chunying said Lukashenko will visit until 2 March “at the invitation of Chinese president Xi Jinping”. Lukashenko is a close ally of the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, and has backed Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Belarus is dependent on its neighbour financially and politically. China is willing to work with Belarus to deepen mutual political trust, the Chinese foreign minister, Qin Gang, told his Belarusian counterpart, Sergei Aleinik, during a phone conversation on Friday, according to a Chinese foreign ministry statement. In September last year, Xi and Lukashenko announced an “all-weather” strategic partnership, when the two met in the Uzbek capital, Samarkand. The US president, Joe Biden, has said it was “not rational” for China to be negotiating the outcome of the Ukraine war, when asked about Beijing’s peace plan for the conflict. “Putin’s applauding it, so how could it be any good?” Biden told ABC News on Friday. “The idea that China is going to be negotiating the outcome of a war that’s a totally unjust war for Ukraine, is just not rational.” China called for a ceasefire and peace talks between Ukraine and Russia on Friday, offering a 12-point proposal to end the fighting. China’s plan urges both sides to agree to a gradual de-escalation and warns against the use of nuclear weapons. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has cautiously welcomed China’s peace plan to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but said it would be acceptable only if it led to Vladimir Putin pulling his troops out from all occupied Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian president said he “wanted to believe” Beijing was interested in a “fair peace”. That meant not “supplying weapons to Russia”, he said, adding: “I’m doing my best to prevent that from happening. This is priority number one.” Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Joe Biden, has said it was “not rational” for China to be negotiating the outcome of the Ukraine war, when asked about Beijing’s peace plan for the conflict. “Putin’s applauding it, so how could it be any good?” the US president told ABC News on Friday. Biden also ruled out “for now” sending American advanced fighter jets to Ukraine, telling the interview that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy “doesn’t need F-16s now”. The US president told the ABC “there is no basis upon which there is a rationale, according to our military now, to provide F-16s” to Ukraine. We’ll have more on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: The first Polish Leopard tanks have arrived in Ukraine, with the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, confirming that four tanks had been delivered. “Poland and Europe stand by your side. We will definitely not leave you, we will support Ukraine until complete victory over Russia,” he said, standing alongside the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during his visit to Kyiv to mark the the first anniversary of the Russian invasion. Zelenskiy has declared victory to be inevitable as his country marked the anniversary of the moment it was invaded by Russian troops. In a national address on Friday, Zelenskiy told Ukrainians they had been proven invincible over “a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity”. The US has announced that it will offer over $10bn in assistance to Ukraine. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said that the funds were crucial to Ukraine and ensured that the Ukrainian government could continue to meet “the critical needs of its citizens, including healthcare, education and emergency services”. Washington has also announced an additional package of security assistance for Ukraine. In a statement, the Biden administration said it would include “several new unmanned aerial systems (UAS), counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) equipment to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences … and electronic warfare detection equipment to bolster Ukraine’s ability to repel Russia’s aggression”. Sweden will send up to 10 Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and defence minister, Pål Jonson, said. “The Swedish tanks reinforce the Leopard 2 contribution that other European countries make. Coordination of support is ongoing with international partners donating Leopard 2 or other tanks,” the government said. Canada will provide additional military support to Ukraine, prime minister, Justin Trudeau, announced. He said Canada would provide four additional Leopard 2 main battle tanks. The additional tanks will bring up the total number of tanks provided by Canada to eight. The Group of Seven has announced a range of further economic, military and financial sanctions against Russia. It promised measures against Russian diamond exports, warning that third countries that help Russia evade sanctions would face “severe costs”. The G7 is understood to be setting up an “enforcement coordination mechanism” to stop evasion of its sanctions already imposed. Zelenskiy has welcomed some elements of a Chinese proposal for a ceasefire in Russia’s war on Ukraine. China’s government called for peace talks while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians. “China has shown its thoughts. I believe that the fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad,” Zelenskiy said."

                    "bodyText": "At the climax of the pageantry in Moscow to mark the first anniversary of the start of Vladimir Putin’s full-scale war in Ukraine, the Kremlin wheeled out children from Mariupol in occupied south-east Ukraine to “thank” their invaders. The star of this orgy of Russian patriotism was Anna Naumenko, a 15-year-old with black hair, who was pushed on to the stage of Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium to thank a soldier nicknamed “Yuri Gagarin” for rescuing her: “Thank you Uncle Yura for saving me, my sister and hundreds of thousands of children in Mariupol.” Anna’s sister, Karolina, covered her ears against the noise of the crowd as she stood nearby. As the Ukrainian children crowded round to hug the soldier, their former neighbours from Mariupol felt shock and disgust. These were children they had huddled with in basements less than a year earlier, sheltering from Russian bombs and suffering from hunger and cold as Moscow launched a bloody onslaught that destroyed the city. “The abomination is that these are not actors,” wrote one. “They are really children from Mariupol.” Pointing out another child, he added: “That teenager in a black hat and grey jacket hugging the occupier is Kostya, my neighbour. We lived in the same building, and spent the first month of the war in the same shelter.” The former resident gave the Observer social media information and other details about the family with whom he had shared a shelter underneath a building in Mariupol’s Left Bank district before being evacuated on 20 March. He described walking over dead bodies with Kostya’s father when they went to a bread factory to search for food and get water from a pump. “I assume that they were invited to Moscow for this show. Perhaps for a monetary reward or motivated otherwise,” he said. “I can’t call Kostya’s parents pro-Russian because before the full-scale war, they never expressed a concrete opinion.” The man’s comments were corroborated by another former Mariupol resident, Daria Shrycheva, who had sheltered in the same basement at the administration building, sharing a room with 40 people. She has described similar scenes of bodies in the street near the bread factory – blood turning to jelly in the cold – and also told of dwindling food and water supplies, and eight of their neighbours being killed or wounded when bombs landed across the street. At one point, food was so scarce that she and three other people shared a single chocolate bar, the only food they had had in days. They also fled Mariupol in late March. “Kostya’s mom and dad were good people,” said Shrycheva, who remembered that Kristina, the mother, worked in a store in their neighbourhood. “We shared food with them, so did they. Kostya is a very kind and good boy.” “My husband was running with Kostya’s dad to get water and food for us under fire,” she told the Observer. “Igor helped extinguish the fire when our building was set on fire by the Russians. I know their apartment is gone, their whole house burned down and has already been demolished.” Like others, she was surprised at the boy’s appearance at the pro-Russian concert. “I don’t know why Kostya’s family has changed their attitude towards Russians. I think they’re ‘adapters’ … These are people who don’t care what flag to live under. They are looking for benefits for themselves from either side. Maybe then it was convenient for them to support Ukraine, and now it is convenient for them to support Russia.” Kostya’s mother, Kristina, now works in the “administration” of occupied Mariupol, she added. Social media profiles for Kostya’s family show they still live in Mariupol. His father, Igor, and mother, Kristina, did not reply to a request for comment. But their stories, and others, have now also been confirmed by Russian and Ukrainian media, with bleak stories of what the children brought to the media circus in Moscow had been through. Polina Tsvetkova, a Russian state TV presenter who helped organise the event, wrote: “After the broadcast, I met with the children who were saved in Mariupol by volunteer Yuri Gagarin. More than 300 children! They call him an angel, and the team and I also tried to be angels for the kids and organise a joyful time in Moscow! We will show the story about our children on Channel One next week.” Anna was also confirmed to be from Mariupol by Informator, a Ukrainian news website. “Her mother, blogger Olga Naumenko, is known in the city,” the site wrote. According to the website, Olga was killed in the war. iStories, a Russian news website, later confirmed that the Naumenko family had sheltered in the House of Culture and then the Left Bank administration building, as had Kostya’s family. In April, Olga was killed by shrapnel from an explosion when she “ran out for cigarettes”, an eyewitness said. She was buried in the grounds of a hospital. A social media post at the time said she had left behind three children: “Anya, Karolina and Danya.” While Anna thanked “Yuri Gagarin” for saving her and her sister, she made no mention of her brother. Last week’s events were full of pomp, but thin on substance. Putin’s “state of the nation” speech on Tuesday had been hailed by state TV as the “most important political moment of the year”. Billboards in Moscow said, in white text on a black background, that there would be “no going back”, recalling Putin’s 2016 statement that “the borders of Russia end nowhere”. In the event, it was standard fare: grievances against the west, modest promises of social aid, and assurances that Russia was fighting for national survival and would ultimately win. Putin made news by suspending compliance with New Start, Russia’s last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US. But what his speech did not include was any concrete idea as to how Russia would win in Ukraine or prevail in its new conflict with the west. “This is revanchist rhetoric and it is losing,” wrote Maxim Trudolyubov, a prominent Russian journalist and columnist. “This is extremely far from a sermon – this kind of speech does not make the flock sigh, be touched and see the light ahead.” There were quiet moments of reflection , as a trickle of Russians gathered at the statue of Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka, which has become an informal memorial for opponents of the war. “It is endless pain. It’s a feeling life will never be the same again,” said one young woman filmed there sobbing. “The world has crumbled. All my family are Ukrainians but we live in Russia. If [my grandfather] were alive, he’d probably call himself Russian. But I can’t call myself Russian. I don’t have a home any more.” But the state’s resources are far larger. It is estimated that 200,000 people were bussed, cajoled or lured to the stadium where, a little over four years ago, Russia hosted the World Cup final. Now, it was decked out in Russian tricolours, army flags and large Zs, the informal symbol of Russia’s war against Ukraine. These are the images of Russia that Putin imagines to be true: loyal, patriotic, ecstatic at war, slavish. Observers have said it is similar to how he imagined Ukraine. “Putin has convinced himself that Ukrainian society is the same kind of theatre that he, using murder and threats, has made out of Russian society,” Trudolyubov wrote when the war began. “His television and press have for many years had only one client and one viewer – he himself. He has poisoned himself with his own lie.” For those watching from Ukraine, the spectacle is unbearable. “I feel sick,” wrote Kostya’s former neighbour. “I am burning from the inside.”"

Was Republican, but now identifies as independent Amuse bouche Voted for Trump in 2020 because he didn’t want him to win – “I have a tendency to vote for the loser, so I hoped that would help” For starters Atam My first impression was that he was 30 minutes late and didn’t say sorry. But I was happy waiting at the restaurant; my daughter-in-law had been the pastry chef there. Don By default, I like to listen to what people have to say. He talked about his family and how he liked to travel. We talked about Reno, where I’m from, and how he used to go there to ski. Atam I had two starters: a crab salad and some trout. Most of the food on the menu I try to avoid for health reasons. Don I had crab salad and fried chicken. The big beef Atam We talked about Guantánamo Bay. He thinks it should remain open and that the detainees shouldn’t be put on trial. He believes that if one of them gets released, they’ll go back and start another war against us. Don These people are enemy combatants. I don’t believe they are due a trial because of their special criminal status. Atam said everyone should be allowed a trial regardless of status. Atam Don’t we have a system where we presume innocence until proven guilty? I said we’re causing more harm in the world than good by holding people without trial. There were 750 detainees and there are 30 or 40 left and we’re spending half a billion a year to hold them. Don He was very knowledgable on the numbers, but I stuck to my position. These are wartime combatants and it’s not a normal situation. Atam There didn’t appear to be any facts behind his position; it seemed to be all based on feeling. Sharing plate Atam A country needs immigrants from all different backgrounds – that’s what’s given the US its strength. Don Immigration is a good thing when it’s done correctly. But our southern border is porous and broken; we need to stop the influx of people from South and Central America. We need more immigration judges and personnel to track those who come across. People from other countries must wait in line. Atam It’s partly our policies in Central America that have given us the drug lords and dictatorships that people are fleeing from. We should be more open to those leaving. There’s also a huge shortage of workers in our country. For afters Atam I looked Don up before we met, and read an article he wrote about being attacked at a Black Lives Matter protest. I wanted to know more about it and understand how it had affected him. I went to three protests myself. One was in my neighbourhood, which I will say is the whitest neighbourhood in San Francisco, and there was not a single Black person in the protest. The message from that was that all of society had woken up and realised something was wrong. Don I was covering a BLM protest for a local news outlet and it turned violent. A pair of hooligans who were ransacking Reno city hall beat me up for filming them. I understood why they were protesting, but I didn’t think it was necessary for them to turn to violence. The incident softened me to both the protesters and the police. It also made me aware of the fact that I’m Black in America. Atam understood why I didn’t support the Defund the Police movement. Atam To me, Defund the Police means we need to spend more money on the root causes of crime rather than putting more people with guns on the street. San Francisco has more than 20 police for every 10,000 people and crime is still high. Don The intentions behind Defund the Police are good, but the follow-through is not. I get what they are trying to do – fund services that help minority communities – but I’m not in favour. It won’t work, it’s too extreme. Takeaways Atam It was a very civil conversation, but I don’t think we clicked. He suggested we share contact details, but I don’t think we’ll be meeting up. Don We got on very well. We didn’t find common ground, but I got an understanding of where he was coming from on a few issues. Additional reporting: Kitty Drake • Atam and Don ate at Nopa in San Francisco.

                    "bodyText": "As our Jeep crests the hill we see them, gathering around a nearby waterhole, drinking, grazing, play-fighting. The vast Kruzi plateau stretches before us, edged by the foothills of Mount Cincar, an untamed landscape of scrub and limestone karst in south-west Bosnia and Herzegovina. “Look, here come more,” says Matej, our safari guide, and sure enough a herd of wild horses gallops past, a whirlwind of manes and clattering hooves. Dozens of horses, once used for farming and transport, were set free more than 50 years ago and replaced by machines. Today they number upwards of 700, living in the mountains high above the village of Livno. It’s a magical sight, and another surprise on my tour. I’d come to the country with tour operator Intrepid and international development agency USAID Turizam, who are working, along with the Resilience Council, to develop sustainable tourism here. A multi-pronged, multimillion-dollar initiative is supporting local businesses and communities to expand what’s on offer and encourage visitors to explore rural areas and smaller towns. Today’s off-road adventure takes us high up above Glamočko valley – where the views of the Dinaric Alps wow us – and we lunch on local cheese, cured meats and honey grappa in a remote mountain hut. Our trip began two days earlier in Sarajevo – a place that crams in so much history, beauty and heartbreak it can make your head spin. The horrors of the mid-90s – when the city was subjected to the longest siege in modern history during the Bosnian war – cannot be ignored. We tour the streets with Mohammed, who was 10 when war broke out. He points out a “Sarajevo rose”, mortar shell marks in the pavement painted red on a spot where 36 people died queueing for bread, and tells of underground classrooms and dodging sniper bullets. We visit the Tunnel of Hope – the only connection between besieged Sarajevo and the outside world for more than three years – and stand on the spot where Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated in 1914, sparking the outbreak of the first world war. But wandering the mosaic of cobbled streets, with mosques, churches (both Orthodox and Catholic) and synagogues, by turns reminiscent of Istanbul and Vienna, and later sipping cocktails in one of the bars, the darkness of the past feels a world away. That evening Mustafa and Mersiha welcome us into their home high above town, for a cooking lesson. We feast on burek – pastries filled with meat or spinach and cheese – stuffed vegetables and spicy tarhana soup. “We want to share our home, our food and our country with visitors,” says Mustafa, who started Bosnian Cooking Lessons in 2018. “Tourism can offer us hope, give jobs so people don’t have to go abroad, and bring them together to work for the future.” Sarajevo is surrounded by mountains and we’re soon driving through incredible scenery after we leave the next day. More than 65% of the country is still forested and I’m constantly floored by the views of tree-covered slopes, deep gorges, wild rivers and waterfalls. Picturesque Jajce, a small walled mountain town 100 miles from the capital, has a 22m-high waterfall at its heart. The ancient capital of the Bosnian kings, with a fort, catacombs and a multi-ethnic population, it was also the birthplace of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, formed during the second world war, and the town’s AVNOJ Museum offers a fascinating dive into 20th-century history. Intrepid works with small, locally owned guesthouses and hotels and we stay outside town right on Pliva lake, where a cluster of wooden watermills on the water’s edge date to the middle ages. Mostar, our next base for a couple of nights, is one of the most visited places in the country. Famous for its Ottoman bridge (rebuilt after the war) and fairytale Moorish architecture, it’s popular with day trippers from Dubrovnik. Part of Intrepid and USAID’s mission is to encourage visitors to stay longer, explore the wider area and come out of season, too. There’s a lot to see nearby. Blagaj Tekke, a stunning 15th-century Sufi dervish monastery below cliffs on the Buna River, is a short drive from Mostar. Stolac, the oldest town in the country, lies a little further south. We stop to walk by the river, eat fig and honey cake in the tiny main square and climb to Vidoška Fortress, where we have the ruins and amazing views to ourselves. This area is wine country too, and USAID has helped develop the recently launched Herzegovina Wine Route, highlighting more than 30 wineries of various sizes, with places to stay ranging from campsites to upmarket hotels. Among other plans to diversify the tourism offering is a new Cheese and Honey Trail, with visits to beekeepers. Traditional craftspeople, such as shoemakers in Glamoc, are also being supported with grants to revive their craft and hopefully attract tourists, too. More than 20 new experiences are in the pipeline for 2023. Unsurprisingly, given the country’s wild topography, outdoor adventure is a big attraction, with everything from kayaking and rafting to hiking and rock-climbing on offer. Konjic, a town on the Neretva River between Mostar and Sarajevo, is an adventure hub where husband-and-wife team Amela and Sanjin Bubalo are among the new generation of tourism entrepreneurs. Their company, Visit Konjic, offers day and multi-day tours and we join them for an afternoon of white-water rafting. The river is quite low in October but we race between towering limestone cliffs – passing kids jumping off into the water, while heron fly overhead. It was in this landscape, not far from town, that Yugoslav communist leader Tito built his secret nuclear bunker. The scale and madness of the project is mind-boggling; it took 26 years to complete and could accommodate 350 people living for six months deep underground. We wander through tunnels, past former control rooms and bedrooms. In a fitting twist, the bunker now doubles as an art gallery, with contemporary work in all mediums displayed in the surreal setting. Before we leave, we spend one final day in Sarajevo. The cable car whizzes us from the old town to the top of Trebević mountain in minutes. The Winter Olympics were held here in 1984 and we walk part of the abandoned bobsleigh track – used as an artillery position during the Bosnian war, and now full of colourful graffiti. As I gaze down on the city below, I can’t help feeling that I’ve barely scratched the surface of this complex country. The divisive political system can sometimes mean progress is slow, but witnessing the energy and positivity of the young people I’d met, and the hard work being done on the ground, I feel sure that sustainable tourism will have a positive role to play in the country’s future. “The past is the past,” says Mohammed before we leave. “All I know is I’m proud of my country. And it makes me proud to bring people here. I want to show it to the world.” The trip was provided by Intrepid and USAID Turizam. Intrepid’s new eight-day Bosnia &amp; Herzegovnia Expedition costs from £1,107 and includes breakfast and some meals, accommodation, transport and activities. There are five small-group trips in 2023, starting in May (tailor-made private trips also available). Intrepid is working with Byway to suggest rail itineraries to the country"

                    "bodyText": "The first Polish Leopard tanks have arrived in Ukraine, with the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, confirming that four tanks had been delivered. “Poland and Europe stand by your side. We will definitely not leave you, we will support Ukraine until complete victory over Russia,” he said, standing alongside the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during his visit to Kyiv to mark the the first anniversary of the Russian invasion. Zelenskiy has declared victory to be inevitable as his country marked the anniversary of the moment it was invaded by Russian troops. In a national address earlier on Friday, Zelenskiy told Ukrainians they had been proven invincible over “a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity”. The US has announced that it will offer over $10bn in assistance to Ukraine. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said that the funds are crucial to Ukraine and ensure that the Ukrainian government can continue to meet “the critical needs of its citizens, including healthcare, education and emergency services”. Washington has also announced an additional package of security assistance for Ukraine. In a statement, the Biden administration said it would include “several new unmanned aerial systems (UAS), counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) equipment to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences … and electronic warfare detection equipment to bolster Ukraine’s ability to repel Russia’s aggression”. Sweden will send up to 10 Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and defence minister, Pål Jonson, said. “The Swedish tanks reinforce the Leopard 2 contribution that other European countries make. Coordination of support is ongoing with international partners donating Leopard 2 or other tanks,” the government said. Canada will provide additional military support to Ukraine, prime minister, Justin Trudeau, announced. He said Canada will provide four additional Leopard 2 main battle tanks. The additional tanks will bring up the total number of tanks provided by Canada to eight. The European Union has promised additional support for millions of Ukrainian refugees who have fled their country since Russia’s invasion. The EU Commission vice-president, Margaritis Schinas, said “as far as [refugees from] Ukraine are concerned, the figures are stable. If it happens, we are ready, but it doesn’t seem to be the case for the time being”, referring to a potential increase in refugees. The US Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, pledged American solidarity with Ukraine. “One year ago, Vladimir Putin committed his greatest mistake by underestimating the resolve of Ukraine. Since then, we have seen bravery, patriotism and valour personified by President Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people,” the Democrat said. The Group of Seven has announced a range of further economic, military and financial sanctions against Russia. It promised measures against Russian diamond exports, warning that third countries that help Russia evade sanctions would face “severe costs”. The G7 is understood to be setting up an “enforcement coordination mechanism” to stop evasion of its sanctions already imposed. The UK said it was banning the export of every item Russia has been found using on the battlefield to date, a list covering hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components. The British government is also imposing sanctions on senior executives at Russia’s state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, who Ukraine says are complicit in the seizure and forced nationality change of the staff of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and their children. A “people’s court” has endorsed an indictment against Putin for the crime of aggression and called for his arrest. After a week of hearings in The Hague, a panel of three international legal experts issued the order and called on the international community “to take every step necessary to ensure that a court with legal powers issues an indictment against Putin and takes appropriate measures to arrest the perpetrator and put him on trial in an official Ukraine tribunal as soon as possible”, AP reported. Zelenskiy has welcomed some elements of a Chinese proposal for a ceasefire in Russia’s war on Ukraine. China’s government called for peace talks while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians. “China has shown its thoughts. I believe that the fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad,” Zelenskiy said. Russia appreciated China’s plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and was open to achieving the goals of what it calls its “special military operation” through political and diplomatic means, foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. However, this would also mean recognising “new territorital realities” in Ukraine, Zakharova said, referring to Russia’s unilateral annexation of four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – as well as of Crimea."

Victory is ‘inevitable’, says Zelenskiy Ukraine’s president has declared victory to be inevitable as his country marked the anniversary of the moment Russian tanks poured across the border and missiles flew, an event he described as “the longest day of our lives”, report Peter Beaumont, Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukrainians had survived “a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity” and paid homage to cities that have become bywords for Russian war crimes, such as Bucha, Irpin and Mariupol, describing them as “capitals of invincibility”. The president later cautiously welcomed China’s proposed peace plan but said it would be acceptable only if it led to Vladimir Putin pulling his troops out from all occupied Ukrainian territory. He said he “wanted to believe” Beijing was interested in a “fair peace”. That meant not “supplying weapons to Russia”, he told reporters in Kyiv, adding: “I’m doing my best to prevent that from happening. This is priority number one.” Western leaders are sceptical of the proposal, and argue that Beijing does not have the international credibility to act as a mediator Meanwhile, further sanctions were agreed and the first Polish tanks arrived in Ukraine. The G7 and EU and US announced a range of further economic, military and financial sanctions against Russia, Jennifer Rankin and Julian Borger reported. The G7 warned that third countries that help Russia evade sanctions would face “severe costs”. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, confirmed that four Leopard tanks had been delivered to Ukraine, saying “We will support Ukraine until complete victory over Russia.” Patrick Wintour reported on the redoubled diplomatic efforts to convince states that abstained or remained neutral at this week’s UN general assembly, with US secretary of state Antony Blinken urging them not to be fooled by Russian calls for a temporary or unconditional ceasefire, and warning that China’s peace proposals drew “false equivalence” by calling on both sides to stop fighting. Biden’s surprise visit to Kyiv After a week of freezing temperatures, Kyiv woke on Monday morning to a perfect blue sky. Spring had arrived. And so had someone else, wrote Luke Harding. For Joe Biden to safely visit Ukraine, the White House spirited him out of the country in the middle of the night and made reporters traveling with him swear a temporary oath of secrecy. Whatever the long route to Kyiv, the images on Monday morning told their own remarkable story. Biden and Zelenskiy emerged together from St Michael’s Cathedral, one of an ensemble of religious buildings in the ancient heart of the city. In front of them was St Sophia, a second great cathedral built in the 11th century, when Moscow was just bog and forest. The pair went on a brief walkabout. As they passed a mural of St Michael and his angels, an air raid siren rang out. For Kyivans this was business as usual. But it underscored the huge symbolic importance of Biden’s visit, ahead of the anniversary on Friday of Russia’s bloody invasion. And it said something too, perhaps, about the 80-year-old president’s steely and daring resolve. Biden and Putin’s duelling speeches From Kyiv, Biden travelled to Warsaw, Poland, where – a few hours after Putin had delivered his state of the nation – the US president gave the western view. In their speeches, Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin could not have been further apart in their interpretations of the past year, Patrick Wintour wrote. But in one aspect they were agreed: this is a war intended to remain on the territory of Ukraine, but is being elevated into something far wider – a battle of survival between the west and Russia. Both men also implicitly tied their own futures to the outcome of this war, saying their opponent was bound to lose. Biden claimed Putin’s year of war has left behind “burned-out tanks and Russian forces in disarray” but he also warned of “very bitter days” ahead in the defence of democracy in eastern Europe, Julian Borger reported. Putin suspends participation in nuclear treaty Vladimir Putin used his speech to Russia’s leaders to announce that he was suspending the country’s participation in New Start, the last major remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the US, in a speech devoted to the one-year anniversary of Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine. The full implications of Putin’s threat were not immediately clear. Russia has already suspended mutual inspections of nuclear weapons sites and participation in a bilateral consultative commission, Andrew Roth and Julian Borger explained. Experts in the US said it was about dividing opinion. What is New Start? Signed by then US president Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, in 2010, the New Start treaty caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the United States and Russia can deploy. Together, the US and Russia own 90% of the world’s nuclear weapons. We have an explainer here. The muted Russian protest against the war Andrew Roth reported on the families of dead Russian soldiers, who are supportive of the military operation. Fifteen minutes before midnight, a young Russian conscript named Danila, who had been sent to fight in Ukraine, picked up his phone to write a message to his family and friends back home in a small town in the Samara region. It was 31 December. “We congratulated each other, wished each other the best for the new year, and then he was gone,” said a close friend who wrote with him that night. Minutes later, a US-made Himars rocket slammed into Professional Technical School No. 19 in Makiivka, a city in eastern Ukraine under Russian occupation. It took nearly 50 days for Danila’s remains to be identified beneath the rubble. His family spent weeks calling local hospitals and a military hotline, where they were told to wait for news that never seemed to come. A year of the Ukraine war In a special series to mark a year of the war that many doubted would happen until the day that it did, on 24 February 2022, the Guardian’s editors and journalists have put together a series of stories looking at the war from different perspectives. First, there is the year as experienced by Ukrainians. When Viacheslav Bozhko, 29, thinks about the time before the war, it seems distant, he told Clea Skopeliti. “It feels like a different life. Pretty much everything has changed,” he said. “It feels like the war has been going for much longer than that.” Then, there is the war as it is experienced by Russians. Julia*, 31, who works in education and lives in central Moscow, says language used in conversation has palpably changed over the past 12 months, which she feels is indicative of a cultural shift, reflecting that many Russians are on a war footing these days, or even celebrating Russia’s aggression. “The rhetoric of my colleagues and family has become violent. For example, they quote things [the Russian foreign minister, Sergei] Lavrov says, containing mafia expressions and prison slang. Speaking like this is very uncharacteristic of these people, she told Jedidajah Otte. Back in Ukraine, there are very few civilians still living and fighting on the frontlines. Luke Harding spoke to a special air intelligence unit – known by the name Vortex – which operates from a line of forward trenches dug around Huliaipilske. Once home to 1,000 people, the village is now a ghostly wreck. The Russians are less than two miles away. The Guardian’s reporters on the ground have told the stories that have stayed with them the most. For Daniel Boffey, it was the day he arrived in Bucha, north of Kyiv, shortly after the Russians had retreated from the town. “It will live with me for ever. The violence perpetuated there was so overwhelming, from the pools of Russian blood in the cratered homes to the bodies freshly buried in the front gardens. But it was the testimony of Zinaida Grynenko, 61, that made the most profound impression. Her son-in-law had been found dead the previous morning. She had been led to the man’s body, riddled with bullets, as she had emerged from her cellar after weeks in hiding. Zinaida was yet to break the news of the man’s death to her daughter. Despite standing outside her own home, she seemed so utterly lost.” Or you could look at the war in data and maps. A new Guardian analysis of Institute for the Study of War data shows that, after once having seized as much as 51,000 sq miles (132,000 sq km) of Ukrainian land, Russia has since lost a fifth of this. The environmental toll is staggering, Jonathan Watts reports, with a hundred and sixty nature reserves, 16 wetlands and two biospheres are under threat of destruction, six hundred species of animals and 880 species of plants are under threat of extinction and up to 40% of arable land not available for cultivation. Finally, with no sign that the war will end soon, Peter Beaumont takes stock and looks at who is winning, and what the coming months might bring. The picture looks very different to the first weeks of the war, he writes. Dan Sabbagh assessed the potential outcomes of the war. Then there are the photographs. XX and XX, XX and XX. Here are the year’s most evocative of a country under siege. UN calls for immediate Russian withdrawal The UN voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to demand Russia immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Ukraine, marking one year since Moscow’s invasion by calling for a “comprehensive, just and lasting peace”. The resolution saw 141 countries in favour with seven against and 32 abstentions, including China, Patrick Wintour reported. Ukraine’s allies for their part had tried to maximise consultations, and in the resolution put a heavy emphasis on the willingness of Ukraine to seek dialogue. Ukraine was also persuaded to remove planned references to taking the Russian leadership to a special tribunal for committing war crimes. Several speakers said such a move would only make the search for peace more elusive. Six countries joined Russia to vote no - Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua and Syria. Among those abstaining, Thailand said it did not want to become involved in a morality play, while South Africa claimed the resolution would not advance the cause of peace. The Chinese deputy envoy to the UN, Dai Bing, said the west was throwing fuel on to the fire by arming Ukraine. That would only exacerbate tensions, he said. Earlier in the week, Helen Davidson covered the moment China’s new foreign minister, Qin Gang, expressed concern about the war in Ukraine escalating and possibly “spiralling out of control”. “We urge certain countries to immediately stop fuelling the fire, stop shifting blame to China, and stop hyping up Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow,” he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed the vote as “a powerful signal of unflagging global support for Ukraine”."

                    "bodyText": "It is midnight in Kyiv. It has been a busy day for Ukraine as the country marked its one-year anniversary since the Russian invasion. Here is a wrap-up of today’s developments: Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has announced that Canada will provide additional military support to Ukraine. On Friday, Trudeau said that Canada will provide four additional Leopard 2 main battle tanks. The additional tanks will bring up the total number of tanks provided by Canada to eight. The US has announced that it will offer over $10 billion in assistance to Ukraine. Blinken said that the funds are crucial to Ukraine and ensure that the Ukrainian government can continue to meet “the critical needs of its citizens, including healthcare, education, and emergency services.” A ‘people’s court’ has endorsed an indictment against Russian president Vladimir Putin for the crime of aggression and called for his arrest. After a week of hearings in The Hague, a panel of three international legal experts issued the order and called on the international community “to take every step necessary to ensure that a court with legal powers issues an indictment against president Vladimir Putin and takes appropriate measures to arrest the perpetrator and put him on trial in an official Ukraine tribunal as soon as possible,” the AP reports. The European Union has promised additional support for millions of Ukrainian refugees that have fled their country since Russia’s invasion one year ago. Speaking to the Associated Press on Friday, EU Commission vice president Margaritis Schinas said, “As far as (refugees from) Ukraine are concerned, the figures are stable. “If it happens, we are ready, but it doesn’t seem to be the case for the time being,” he said, referring to a potential increase in refugees. US Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has released a statement marking the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in which he pledged American solidarity. “One year ago, Vladimir Putin committed his greatest mistake by underestimating the resolve of Ukraine. Since then, we have seen bravery, patriotism, and valor personified by President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people,” Schumer wrote. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has declared victory to be inevitable as his country marked the anniversary of the moment it was invaded by Russian troops. In a national address earlier on Friday, Zelenskiy told Ukrainians they had been proven invincible over “a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity.” The Group of Seven (G7) has announced a range of further economic, military and financial sanctions against Russia. The group announced it would take unprecedented measures in order to weaken Russia, promising measures against Russian diamond exports. It warned that third countries that help Russia evade sanctions would face “severe costs” and is understood to be setting up an “enforcement coordination mechanism” to stop evasion of G7 sanctions already imposed. The UK said it was banning the export of every item Russia has been found using on the battlefield to date, a list covering hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components. The British government is also imposing sanctions on senior executives at Russia’s state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, who Ukraine says are complicit in the seizure and forced nationality change of the staff of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and their children. Sweden will send up to 10 Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and defence minister, Pål Jonson, said today. “The Swedish tanks reinforce the Leopard 2 contribution that other European countries make. Coordination of support is ongoing with international partners donating Leopard 2 or other tanks,” the government said. President Zelenskiy has welcomed some elements of a Chinese proposal for a ceasefire in Russia’s war on Ukraine. China’s government called for peace talks while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians, in a statement which appeared to maintain Beijing’s stance that the west was fuelling the conflict and which analysts dismissed as anodyne. “China has shown its thoughts. I believe that the fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad,” Zelenskiy said. Russia appreciated China’s plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and was open to achieving the goals of what it calls its “special military operation” through political and diplomatic means, foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. However, this would also mean recognising “new territorital realities” in Ukraine, Zakharova said, referring to Russia’s unilateral annexation of four Ukrainian regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - as well as of Crimea. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as we close the blog for today. Thank you for following along. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has announced that Canada will provide additional military support to Ukraine. On Friday, Trudeau said that Canada will provide four additional Leopard 2 main battle tanks, CTV News reports. The additional tanks will bring up the total number of tanks provided by Canada to eight. Canada will also provide an armoured recovery vehicle, as well as over 5,000 rounds of ammunition. The US has announced that it will offer over $10 billion in assistance to Ukraine. In a statement on Friday, secretary of state Antony Blinken said, “…in coordination with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of the Treasury, we are announcing over $10 billion in assistance, including budgetary support to the Government of Ukraine and additional energy assistance to support Ukrainians suffering from Russia’s attacks.” Blinken said that the funds are crucial to Ukraine and ensure that the Ukrainian government can continue to meet “the critical needs of its citizens, including healthcare, education, and emergency services.” He added that the Biden administration is also working alongside Congress to provide additional energy assistance to the war-torn country – a $250 contribution that will in turn address “immediate needs, including critical power grid equipment.” The assistance is in addition to the $270 million that the US has already committed to help safeguard and bolster the country’s energy security in the past year. A ‘people’s court’ has endorsed an indictment against Russian president Vladimir Putin for the crime of aggression and called for his arrest. The Associated Press reports: The symbolic decision Friday came on the anniversary of Russia’s illegal invasion of its neighbor that triggered Europe’s biggest and deadliest conflict since World War II. After a week of hearings in The Hague, a panel of three international legal experts issued the order and called on the international community “to take every step necessary to ensure that a court with legal powers issues an indictment against president Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and takes appropriate measures to arrest the perpetrator and put him on trial in an official Ukraine tribunal as soon as possible.” The judges, including Stephen Rapp, a U.S. prosecutor who once headed the successful effort to bring former Liberian President Charles Taylor to justice for crimes in Sierra Leone, heard testimony from survivors of Russian attacks in Ukraine and from military experts before issuing their order. The ruling comes amid international efforts to establish a tribunal that could prosecute Putin and other Russian leaders for the crime of aggression. The International Criminal Court has opened an investigation in Ukraine, but doesn’t have jurisdiction to prosecute the crime of aggression. The presiding judge at the court, South African Zak Jacoob, said that he hoped the hearings would add to the pressure for a special court. “Hopefully this is a step to prosecution. As I said, we have no legal authority or force, but hopefully we have the authority of moral force and moral persuasion, which would take us somewhere,” he told reporters. The people’s court found that evidence presented was strong enough to indict Putin, saying that as head of state he “planned, prepared, initiated and executed — and continues to plan and execute — the Russian Federation’s acts of aggression in Ukraine.” Jacoob, called Putin’s justifications for the war “pathetic.” An invitation for Putin or his legal representatives to take part in the hearings went unanswered, prosecutors said. “It is an insult to the international community and to the integrity of the world to make the sort of claims that he has made. And I reject them in no uncertain terms,” Jacoob said. The Eiffel Tower has lit up in blue and yellow – colors of the Ukrainian flag – in a show of solidarity for the country on the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion. “Paris once again shows its solidarity with the Ukrainian people, who are fighting tirelessly for freedom and democracy,” tweeted Paris deputy mayor Jean-Luc Romero-Michel. The European Union has promised additional support for millions of Ukrainian refugees that have fled their country since Russia’s invasion one year ago. Speaking to the Associated Press on Friday, EU Commission vice president Margaritis Schinas said, “As far as (refugees from) Ukraine are concerned, the figures are stable. Schinas added that he did not think it was “automatic” that the number of refugees would increase in the coming months. “If it happens, we are ready, but it doesn’t seem to be the case for the time being,” he said. US Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has released a statement marking the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in which he pledged American solidarity. “One year ago, Vladimir Putin committed his greatest mistake by underestimating the resolve of Ukraine. Since then, we have seen bravery, patriotism, and valor personified by President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people,” Schumer wrote. “To honor that heroism and show the United States’ unwavering support for Ukraine’s fight for freedom and democracy, I was proud to lead the Senate in delivering over $113 billion in military, economic, and humanitarian aid their country needed and deserved. Now, and for as long as it takes, the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine,” he added. During a security council meeting at the United Nations, Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzya, interrupted a minute of silence which Ukraine’s foreign minister requested for those who died as a result of “Russian aggression.” ‘All lives are priceless ... we are rising to remember the memory [of all the victims],” Nebenzya said, interrupting the minute’s silence, before it resumed. Today marks the first anniversary of Russia’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine. It’s been a busy one, so here’s a look at the key developments: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has declared victory to be inevitable as his country marked the anniversary of the moment it was invaded by Russian troops. In a national address earlier on Friday, Zelenskiy told Ukrainians they had been proven invincible over “a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity”. He paid homage to cities that have become bywords for Russian war crimes, such as Bucha, Irpin and Mariupol, describing them as “capitals of invincibility”. The Group of Seven (G7) has announced a range of further economic, military and financial sanctions against Russia. The group announced it would take unprecedented measures in order to weaken Russia, promising measures against Russian diamond exports. It warned that third countries that help Russia evade sanctions would face “severe costs” and is understood to be setting up an “enforcement coordination mechanism” to stop evasion of G7 sanctions already imposed. The US led the way with an announcement of further military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia and its supporters, including Chinese companies. The military assistance package will include several new drone and anti-drone systems the US has not previously made available, as well as equipment to help Ukraine counter Russian electronic warfare. The US will also send more ammunition for the high mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars) and 155mm howitzer guns Washington has provided over the course of the year. The UK said it was banning the export of every item Russia has been found using on the battlefield to date, a list covering hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components. The British government is also imposing sanctions on senior executives at Russia’s state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, who Ukraine says are complicit in the seizure and forced nationality change of the staff of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and their children. But Britain is not planning to send RAF Typhoons to Ukraine, the defence secretary Ben Wallace has said. Wallace said the jets would be too complex for Ukraine – but added, with the backing of Downing Street, the fighters could provide air cover for eastern bloc countries to backfill if they wanted to send their MiG-29 and other Soviet-era jets to Kyiv. The EU is expected to announce a ban on €11bn (£9.7bn) worth of exports of critical technologies to Russia, as part of a 10th round of sanctions. Despite plans to have the measures in place by the first anniversary of the invasion, the latest measures were being held up by a last-minute dispute over how quickly to ban synthetic rubber imports from Russia. Italy objected to a rapid phase-out, while Poland blindsided other member states with its insistence the trade be stopped as soon as possible. The first Polish Leopard tanks have arrived in Ukraine. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, confirmed that four Leopard tanks had been delivered to Ukraine. “Poland and Europe stand by your side. We will definitely not leave you, we will support Ukraine until complete victory over Russia,” he said, standing alongside President Zelenskiy during his visit to Kyiv. He said Poland will provide more Leopard tanks soon, as well as a number of upgraded, Soviet-era T-72 tanks. Sweden will send up to 10 Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and defence minister, Pål Jonson, said today. “The Swedish tanks reinforce the Leopard 2 contribution that other European countries make. Coordination of support is ongoing with international partners donating Leopard 2 or other tanks,” the government said. President Zelenskiy has welcomed some elements of a Chinese proposal for a ceasefire in Russia’s war on Ukraine. China’s government called for peace talks while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians, in a statement which appeared to maintain Beijing’s stance that the west was fuelling the conflict and which analysts dismissed as anodyne. “China has shown its thoughts. I believe that the fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad,” Zelenskiy said. Russia appreciated China’s plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and was open to achieving the goals of what it calls its “special military operation” through political and diplomatic means., foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. However, this would also mean recognising “new territorital realities” in Ukraine, Zakharova said, referring to Russia’s unilateral annexation of four Ukrainian regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - as well as of Crimea. But western leaders have largely dismissed China’s peace plan for Ukraine, arguing that Beijing does not have the international credibility to act as a mediator in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The 12-point position paper on Ukraine, for which Kyiv was not consulted, was criticised by US officials and some analysts who noted the growing ties between China and Russia. On Wednesday, China’s top diplomat visited Moscow and pledged a deeper partnership. The World Bank has announced $2.5bn (£2.1bn) in additional grant financing for Ukraine to support the country’s budget and to maintain essential services. The funds will go towards supporting Ukraine’s key sectors, including health care, schools, payment of pensions, payments for internally displaced people, social assistance programs, and wages for employees providing core government services, it said. The White House says it believes Russia may provide Iran with fighter jets and other military equipment in exchange for support for its war in Ukraine. The White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said the US had information that Iran had shipped artillery and tank rounds to Russia in November. In return, Russia was offering “unprecedented defence cooperation”, including on missiles, electronics and fighter jets, he said. Commemorations have been held in Ukraine and around the world on the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, with moments of silence observed, candlelit vigils and protests. Our picture editors have selected some of the strongest images from the events for this gallery. Britain is not planning to send RAF Typhoons to Ukraine, the defence secretary has said, rejecting a high profile campaign led by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, with the support of the former prime minister Boris Johnson. Ben Wallace said the jets would be too complex for Ukraine – but added, with the backing of Downing Street, the fighters could provide air cover for eastern bloc countries to backfill if they wanted to send their MiG-29 and other Soviet-era jets to Kyiv. The defence secretary said: “We’re not going to send our own Typhoon jets in the short term to Ukraine,” in an interview with Sky News to coincide with the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion on Friday. But the comments deal a blow to Zelenskiy, who travelled to the UK this month to make a dramatic request for “wings for freedom” in a rare address by a foreign leader to both Houses of Parliament in Westminster. Instead, Wallace said that if other countries with Soviet-origin aircraft wanted to supply Ukraine instead, the UK would be willing to help provide air cover for that country to make up for the loss of jets. Read the full story here: The World Bank has announced $2.5bn (£2.1bn) in additional grant financing for Ukraine to support the country’s budget and to maintain essential services. The funds will go towards supporting Ukraine’s key sectors, including health care, schools, payment of pensions, payments for internally displaced people, social assistance programs, and wages for employees providing core government services, a statement from the World Bank said. The president of the World Bank group, David Malpass, said: One year into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the world continues to witness the horrific destruction inflicted on the country and its people. We will continue supporting the people of Ukraine through urgent repair projects and coordination with the Government for recovery and reconstruction efforts Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has thanked Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, following the announcement that Stockholm will send up to 10 Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has wrapped up his press conference after more than two hours of taking questions from journalists. The Ukrainian leader concluded the conference by talking about his family. “I love them, I love my family. I love my wife,” he said. He said his children are “the most important people” for him, but that he did not get to see them often and that he didn’t have “any opportunities” to see his own parents. On the subject of Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, he said he was “very proud” of her and that she was “doing everything she can for the sake of our children and the country”. He added: The most important thing is not to let them down. The most important thing is to make sure that my children are proud of me. The EU’s top diplomats have for a third day running failed to agree on the bloc’s tenth round of sanctions against Russia, according to sources. Talks are understood to be stuck on the question of rubber trade with Russia, with Poland reportedly rejecting Italy’s demand for laxer new curbs on rubber imports. Reuters reports that Poland said proposed restrictions on EU imports of Russia rubber included such a big quota of imports exempted and such long transition periods that they would have no effect in practice. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, had told Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the EU aimed to have the measures in place by today, the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Zelenskiy asks the BBC’s James Waterhouse if he can send a question to Rishi Sunak for fighter jets and Typhoons. Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, told leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) that he supported Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s calls for China to engage with Ukraine during a virtual meeting to mark the one-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine, Downing Street has said. During the meeting, Sunak said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was “not just a Euro-Atlantic problem, but an attack on universal principles”, a spokesperson for the prime minister said. The G7 leaders “reiterated their unfaltering support for Ukraine and agreed on the need to continue to intensify military aid”, and “praised the steadfast international unity throughout the past year”, they said. The leaders also discussed the strong show of support for Ukraine at the United Nations (UN) last night, and the prime minister emphasised that by supporting Ukraine, the international community was upholding the UN’s Charter. They added: Reflecting on China’s ceasefire proposals, the prime minister said he supported President Zelenskiy’s calls for China to engage with Ukraine, adding that peace could only be achieved on Ukraine’s terms. The prime minister added that the international community needed to support Ukraine with long-term military and security assurances to send a strong message to President Putin that the global support was enduring. Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he plans to meet the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and said it would be “useful” to both countries and global security. “As far as I know, China respects historical integrity”, he says at a news conference in Kyiv. China needs to do its best to make sure that the Russian Federation withdraws from our territory because that’s what respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty means. My colleague Luke Harding is covering Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s news conference in Kyiv. Asked if Putin will try to invade another country, given his military setbacks in Ukraine, Zelenskiy replies: Unfortunately yes. I believe it is possible and it might happen. He warns that Russia “will come for Nato states if the US abandons Ukraine” in the war. The White House says it believes Russia may provide Iran with fighter jets and other military equipment in exchange for support for its war in Ukraine Speaking to reporters, the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said the US had information that Iran had shipped artillery and tank rounds to Russia in November. In return, Russia was offering “unprecedented defence cooperation”, including on missiles, electronics and fighter jets, he said. He said Iran was also seeking to purchase attack helicopters, radars and combat trainer aircraft. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is still taking questions from journalists at a news conference in Kyiv. We will have a full write-up of what he said, but here are some more key points: Ukraine’s president said one of his biggest disappointments of the war had been to see people who could have fought leave the country when Russia invaded, referring to officials who fled. Asked if he would join negotiations mediated by Turkey if Vladimir Putin came to the table, Zelenskiy said he would “accept” it. The Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, “knows my view”, Zelenskiy said. We discussed this before the war. I told him to put Putin at the table for negotiations. ‘Can we please do that? We must avert a full-scale war.’ But [Erdogan] was not able to do that. Not only him — he is powerful — but he is not able to do it. And now he thinks that he is? Now we can’t. Zelenskiy also dismissed Russia’s allegations that Kyiv has aims on Moldova’s breakaway Russian-speaking Transdniestria region. The region was the sovereign territory of Moldova, he said. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has shared a photo of him shaking hands with his Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki, in front of the first Leopard 2 tanks in Kyiv. Writing on Twitter, Shmyhal said Kyiv was grateful to Poland for the “decisive steps that bring Ukraine closer to victory” and that he was waiting for the expansion of the western “tank coalition”. The Group of Seven nations (G7) is taking actions against third-country actors “materially supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine,” the bloc said in a statement as it reaffirmed its support for Ukraine. The statement reads: We call on third-countries or other international actors who seek to evade or undermine our measures to cease providing material support to Russia’s war, or face severe costs. To deter this activity around the world, we are taking actions against third-country actors materially supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine. The G7 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. Asked if Australia should reopen its embassy in Kyiv, Zelenskiy says he would like to shake hands with the returning Australian ambassador. He says: Please come back. But on a Bushmeister. We need one more. Here are some more remarks from Volodymyr Zelenskiy on China’s ceasefire proposal. Zelenskiy said he welcomed some elements of the plan, but said only the country where a war is being fought should be the initiator of a peace plan. Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said: I think it’s correct to think that if there are thoughts that, in one way or another, correspond with respect for international law, to territorial integrity... let’s work with China on this point. Why not? He urged Beijing not to provide Moscow with arms, but added that it was promising that China, an ally of Russia, was considering brokering peace, adding: Our task is to gather everyone to isolate one. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has appeared to make a dig at China’s newly published 12-point ceasefire proposal to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. Speaking at the UN security council in New York, Blinken said he expects “many countries will call for peace today,” but “history teaches us that it’s the nature of peace that matters”. Members of the council should not be fooled by calls for a temporary or unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine and should not fall into the “false equivalency” of calling both sides to stop fighting, he said. Russia will use any pause in fighting to consolidate control of territory and replenish its forces, he said. Any peace that legitimises Russia’s seizure of land by force will weaken the Charter and send a message to would-be aggressors everywhere that they can invade countries and get away with it. Asked to share a moment of the war he found most difficult, Zelenskiy replied: Bucha. The moment we de-occupied Bucha. What I saw. It was horrible. What we’ve seen… the devil is not somewhere below us - he’s among us. Asked what the chances are of him negotiating with Vladimir Putin, Zelenskiy said he had a message for Moscow: Respect our right to live on our land, get out of our territory, stop bombing us, stop killing civilians... stop the bombardments. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, says Moscow appreciated China’s plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and said it was open to achieving the goals of what it calls its “special military operation” through political and diplomatic means. She said: We appreciate the sincere desire of our Chinese friends to contribute to resolving the conflict in Ukraine by peaceful means... We share the views of Beijing. However, this would also mean recognising “new territorital realities” in Ukraine, Zakharova said, referring to Russia’s unilateral annexation of four Ukrainian regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - as well as of Crimea. Her remarks came as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said there were points in the Chinese proposals that were understandable” and “there are those that we don’t”. “But it’s something,” he added at a news conference on the first anniversary of the Russian invasion. Zelenskiy said: China has shown its thoughts. I believe that the fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad. But the question is what follows the words. The question is in the steps and where they will lead to. An Azerbaijani journalist asked if he could take a selfie with President Zelenskiy in the middle of a news conference, before asking a question about Ukraine’s relationship with Azerbaijan. Zelenskiy says there are some points in China’s ceasefire statement that are “understandable” to him “and there are those that we don’t”. Zelenskiy says Beijing’s statement “respects our territorial integrity”, adding that it is a good thing that China is talking about Ukraine and that Beijing’s interest is “not bad”. He says: China has started talking about Ukraine, and that is not bad. The Chinese statement respects our territorial integrity. He adds: But the question is what follows the words. The question is in the steps and where they will lead to. Zelenskiy, speaking at a press conference, has called for a summit with Latin American leaders and said Ukraine should take steps to build relations with African countries. He said he would like countries from across Latin America and Africa, as well as China and India, to join a peace formula proposed by Kyiv to end the war with Russia. He says he would attend the summit in person “even though it’s very difficult for me to leave Ukraine”. He says he also wants to have India and China participate in a “peace summit” to end the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile in New York, the Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, has interrupted a minute’s silence during a meeting of the UN security council. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, had called for a minute’s silence to honour “the victims of the aggression”. As members of the assembly stood up, Nebenzya began tapping his microphone and asked for the floor. He said: We are getting up on our feet to honour the memory of all victims of what has happened in Ukraine, starting in 2014. “All of those who perished. All lives are priceless,” he said, appearing to refer to Russian lives lost in the conflict. From my colleague Patrick Wintour: My colleague Luke Harding is at Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s press conference in Kyiv: President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is delivering a statement at a televised press conference to mark the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of his country. You can watch it live here: The Ukrainian leader starts by thanking the journalists who have worked in Ukraine over the last year and calls for a minute of silence to remember those who died in the conflict. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked the UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the people of Britain for their “unwavering support” and “invaluable” help “in hard times”. The Ukrainian leader’s tweet came after Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, announced an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine. The UK foreign office said the internationally coordinated package of sanctions includes aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military-industrial complex. The UK is also sanctioning senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia’s two largest defence companies and four banks. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, is currently addressing a meeting of the UN security council to mark the one-year anniversary of Russia’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine. Guterres says he sat in the council a year ago and urged “in the name of humanity” not to allow “what could be the worst war since the beginning of the century” in Europe. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a “blatant” violation of the UN charter and international law, he says. It has unleashed widespread destruction and displacement attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, and of course, many casualties and terrible suffering. He says the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights has documented dozens of cases of conflict-related sexual violence against men and women. Serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law against prisoners of war, and hundreds of cases of enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions of civilians, were also documented. The past year has been a “living hell” for the people of Ukraine, he says, adding that more than half of all of Ukraine’s children have been forced from their homes. The first Polish Leopard tanks have arrived in Ukraine, as western allies announced a raft of further economic, military and financial sanctions against Russia, in a renewed effort to weaken Vladimir Putin’s war machine. Speaking on the anniversary of the Russian invasion on Friday, Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, said the first Leopard tanks had arrived in Ukraine. He did not specify how many, but Poland had previously requested an export licence from Berlin for 14 Leopard 2 tanks, with the goal of spurring others to do the same. As ceremonies to remember the dead took place in Kyiv, western allies sought to demonstrate their support. Ukraine’s blue and yellow colours were projected on the Eiffel Tower, the Brandenburg Gate, the Empire State Building and EU headquarters, and were painted on the street by activists outside the Russian embassy in London. Ahead of a G7 meeting, the US led the way with an announcement of further military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia and its supporters, including Chinese companies. The military assistance package will include several new drone and anti-drone systems the US has not previously made available, as well as equipment to help Ukraine counter Russian electronic warfare. The new drones include the Switchblade 600, a bigger version of this loitering munition (or kamikaze drone) than has already been supplied, as well as the CyberLux K8, Altius-600, and the Jump 20, which can be used for surveillance or adapted to carry bombs. The US will also send more ammunition for the high mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars) and 155mm howitzer guns Washington has provided over the course of the year. Read the full story by Jennifer Rankin and Julian Borger: Country star Brad Paisley has released a new song featuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Titled Same Here, the song – a single from Paisley’s forthcoming album Son of the Mountains – features audio of Paisley and Zelenskiy discussing the commonalities between Americans and Ukranians, as well as the Ukrainian peoples’ desire for freedom. “I think we appreciate the same things – children, freedom, our flag, our soldiers, our people,” says Zelenskiy on the song. “We are proud of our army, who defend our freedom and defend our lives.” We are fighting for our children, our parents, to defend our houses, our families … there is no distance between our countries in such values. That is very important – to see that they are really, in many things, the same. Per an AP report, Zelenskiy suggested changes to the song prior to its release. “I think he understands that art is how you reach the most people, especially in the heart,” said Paisley. He can give as many speeches as he can give, but it’s a lot easier to hear something with a melody maybe. Commemorations have been held in Ukraine and around the world on the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, with moments of silence observed, candlelit vigils and protests. Our picture editors have selected some of the strongest images from the events for this gallery. Helena Smith reports for the Guardian from Athens: Over in Greece, the foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, has taken to Twitter to express his country’s support for Ukraine as the world marks the first anniversary of an invasion Russia still insists on calling a “special military operation.” “One year since the Russian invasion of Ukraine: Greece has been and remains by the side of the Ukrainian people, committed to its principles of respect for international legality and the territorial sovereignty of all states and against any revisionism,” Dendias wrote. The Greek government’s stance has resulted in a scuppering of ties with fellow Orthodox Russia, once a close ally. Moscow’s displeasure with Nato-member Greece was conveyed in a message tweeted by the Russian embassy in Athens earlier this week in which Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, was quoted as saying: We were friends with the Greeks. We noted the transformations in the country’s leadership. She was forced, or agreed, to submit to American demands. We have drawn conclusions in regard to those who so happily supported aggression against Russia. Meanwhile, officials attending the second European conference in border management in Vouliagmeni outside Athens observed a minute of silence in tribute to the victims of the war. The EU’s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, who is in attendance vowed the 27-member bloc would be standing by Ukraine for as long as it takes. “Ukraine can win this war, but we will be with Ukraine as long as it takes,” she told the AP on the sidelines of the conference. Poland’s deputy interior minister, also attending the conference, said Warsaw was braced – and would welcome – the ever more Ukrainians who could be forced to seek refuge in the neighbouring country if Moscow went ahead with a widely anticipated spring offensive. “We have this contingency planning,” the minister, Bartosz Grodecki, said. “I hope that it will not be necessary (but) … we’ve been trained, planned properly, and we know how to be prepared,” he also told the AP. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to the Telegram app about the visit of Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, to Kyiv today. Zelenskiy writes: Poland was with us even before the start of the full-scale war, was with us every minute of this year and, I am sure, will be with us until our victory. Our joint victory! Today, during the talks with prime minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki, we discussed the entire range of defence issues. Talks concerned weapons for Ukraine, thanks to which Russia’s defeat on the battlefield will be speeded up, and new sanctions against Russia. Separately, I would like to note our cooperation regarding the treatment and rehabilitation of Ukrainian soldiers. I am sure that it will remain a good memory in the history of nations. I am thankful to Mateusz Morawiecki and all our Polish brothers for understanding the situation and needs of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is due to attend an online summit with leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) wealthy democracies, expected to pledge more support for Ukraine and tighten sanctions against Russia. Joe Biden announced new US sanctions on Russia earlier today, and other western allies are expected to do so around the summit to mark the anniversary of Russia’s invasion. Current G7 president Japan said it was considering new measures, without giving any details. The G7 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the US. Sweden will send up to 10 Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and defence minister, Pål Jonson, said today. The Swedish government said in a statement: The Swedish tanks reinforce the Leopard 2 contribution that other European countries make. Coordination of support is ongoing with international partners donating Leopard 2 or other tanks. Canada will provide more than $32m (£19.7m) in support to further strengthen Ukraine’s security and stabilisation, its government has announced. In a statement, Canada’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, said: For an entire year, Canada and the international community have rallied like never before to support Ukraine’s resilience in the face of President Putin’s aggressions. Canada’s support for Ukraine’s sovereignty is unwavering. We will not stand down until Russia is held accountable for its crimes. The $32m includes $7.5m for demining efforts, more than $13m for accountability efforts that include addressing conflict-related sexual violence, and more than $12m to “counter chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats”, the government said. Ukraine’s war reaches the one-year mark with no immediate end in sight. Both sides want to carry on fighting, and any negotiated peace looks a long way off. So how might the war end? The Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, says there are five scenarios to consider. Joe Biden has tweeted his support for Ukraine today on the first anniversary of Russia’s full-fledged invasion, alongside a photograph of him and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv. “Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia. Never,” the US president wrote. Earlier we reported that Poland has delivered its first Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine. Its prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has now confirmed that his country has delivered four Leopards to Kyiv already. Morawiecki, who has been meeting Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv, said at a joint news conference with the Ukrainian leader: Poland and Europe stand by your side. We will definitely not leave you, we will support Ukraine until complete victory over Russia. He said Poland will provide more Leopard tanks soon, as well as a number of upgraded, Soviet-era T-72 tanks. Poland has pledged 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Alexander Kamyshin, the head of Ukraine’s railway company Ukrzaliznytsia, doesn’t get much sleep at the best of times. On Sunday night, as Joe Biden was being ferried into Ukraine in a 10-hour night journey from Poland – in a carriage now known as “Rail Force One”, he got almost none. Along with others involved in the secret operation to bring the US president to his meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Kamyshin watched the progress of the train in a command centre. A handsome bearded man sporting a hipster-ish braid of hair that falls over the shaved sides of his head, Kamyshin is deliberately vague about many of the details. But in the past year, his dedicated team has brought in world leaders, VIPs and diplomatic missions on an almost daily basis as part of a programme called “Iron Diplomacy”. Security is everything, he told the Guardian in an interview at Kyiv’s main railway station. We have not had one leak. There have been no photographs from train attendants. We respect the confidence of the delegations. The challenge is treat the delegations properly because, like Biden, they spend more time on the train than they do in Kyiv. He spent 20 hours on the train and four hours in Kyiv. Everyone knows Ukrainians are brave. We also want them to know that we are welcoming.” Read the full interview here: China’s government has called for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians, in a statement which appeared to maintain Beijing’s stance that the west is fuelling the conflict. The 12-point position paper was released on Friday, on the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion and before an expected speech by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The paper stated that the international community should “create conditions and platforms” for negotiations to resume, and claimed that China would continue to “play a constructive role in this regard”. Russia’s foreign ministry has warned that any actions threatening its troops in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria would be seen as a direct attack on Russia itself and trigger an “adequate response”. The ministry said: Any action that threatens their security will be considered under international law as an attack on the Russian Federation. Today’s warning came a day after Russia’s defence ministry alleged that Ukraine was planning to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria after staging a false-flag operation. The region of Transnistria broke away from then-Soviet Moldova in 1990 and is controlled by Russia separatists. The Russian ministry claimed on Thursday that Ukraine – which borders Moldova – posed “a direct threat” to Russian troops in the Russian-speaking region. Moldova’s government dismissed the accusation, calling for “calm and for information to be received [by the public] from official and credible sources of the Republic of Moldova”. Separately, Russian state-run Tass news agency quoted Russian deputy foreign minister Mikhail Galuzin as saying the west had instructed Moldova’s government in Chisinau to stop all interaction with Transnistria’s Moscow-backed authorities. Liudmyla Bikus recalled how she had tried to dissuade her son Andrii from joining the army. That was in March, weeks after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, one year ago today. “Andrii told me: ‘Mum if I don’t go then who will?’” Bikus said. She added: He was a golden boy. The best son, husband, father and brother. He wanted to defend his country and his family. Andrii was quickly dispatched to the eastern front. Less than three months later he was dead, fatally wounded on 6 June near the city of Lysychansk. A Russian shell landed on top of his artillery position. He was taken to hospital and died from blood loss on the operating table. Eight men from his company perished in the same lethal strike. In September Andrii’s widow Natalia planted a blue and yellow flag with her late husband’s name on it in a memorial garden in central Kyiv. It said: “Eternal memory”. The non-official plot is on a grassy slope in the Maidan, the city’s independence square. On Thursday Bikus went to visit. She brought her daughter Alyona, Andrii’s sister. They couldn’t find the flag. It had somehow got lost among hundreds of new ones, left by grieving relatives. Each marked a victim of Russia’s war: soldiers, civilians, volunteers. There were names, places, dates of birth and death. One said simply: “Anya from Mariupol”. Another: “Roman Stetsiura, 54th brigade, Bakhmut”. Nearby, under a tree, pigeons pecked in the February snow. “A whole young generation is being wiped out. Guys are dying aged 19 and 20. They will never have children or grandchildren,” Bikus reflected. Andrii was 34. He was buried in Kyiv’s Berkovetske cemetery. His seven-year-old son Misha watched as his father’s coffin was lowered gently into the ground. “There are three or four funerals like ours every day,” Bikus said. Read the full report by our foreign correspondent Luke Harding: A number of Russian state-controlled media outlets have been instructed not to quote statements made by the founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, according to a report. Prigozhin, who is one of Vladimir Putin’s most notorious associates, has spent much of the last week publicly criticising Russia’s top military leaders, accusing them of “high treason” and saying they have refused to provide him with munitions in an attempt to wipe out his fighting force. The Wagner boss’s press service published a photo on Wednesday showing what he claimed were dozens of Wagner servicemen who had died because of “shell hunger”. It could not immediately be confirmed if the men had died or if the shot was staged. A day later, Prigozhin said ammunition for his troops had been dispatched. The Russian defence ministry rejected his initial accusations about blocking ammunition as “absolutely untrue”. Independent outlet Verstka, citing sources from the Kremlin-backed media and the Russian defence ministry, reports that Russian state journalists have been ordered not to quote Prigozhin unless absolutely necessary, Meduza writes. Russian authorities have also prepared a “media smear campaign” against Prigozhin, the outlet says, but have decided not to launch it for the time being. One source said: In a meeting this week, the higher-ups repeated to us that the block on Prigozhin that we put in place in January remains in effect. We’re banned from mentioning him unless it’s absolutely necessary, we’re banned from quoting him, except in cases where he’s the first person to report news about successes on the front line. For example, if they captured Soledar or reached the outskirts of Bakhmut. Prigozhin has previously feuded with Russia’s top brass over military tactics and the right to recruit convicts from Russian prisons for the war in Ukraine. But his latest attack on military leaders such as the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, marks an unusual level of infighting in Russia, where the Kremlin has sought to tamp down infighting among elites despite its lack of military success. Prigozhin was conspicuously absent from a major speech Putin gave on Tuesday, and it appears that the ambitious catering magnate may have fallen out of favour. Earlier this year, he announced that he would suspend recruiting in Russian prisons, apparently due to pressure from the Russian defence ministry. The invasion of Ukraine has sparked interest in learning the country’s language among the British public, with the University of Sheffield launching new courses for students and the public, assisted by academics from Lviv. The university says that its beginners classes in Ukrainian language and culture for the public are the first of its kind in the UK. The university will also offer an accelerated course in Ukrainian for students studying Slavonic languages at Sheffield’s modern languages school. Neil Bermel, professor of Slavonic languages at Sheffield, said: We have thousands of Ukrainians living in the UK, including a large number in Sheffield, because of the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme, and many of the hosts are motivated to learn more about the language. The courses are mainly funded by Sheffield, with teaching done by Ukrainian academics seconded from universities in Lviv. If the initial six-week course is a success, Prof Bermel said the university could continue to offer more. Nataliia Faryna, one of course teachers, said: For me, teaching Ukrainian language is a way to tell people about Ukraine, about our culture and worldview, to help those people who have already taken the first steps in the chosen direction get to know it. I am infinitely grateful to the people of Britain for standing with Ukraine in the war and for their unwavering support. Native English speakers will find Ukrainian “a steeper hill to climb compared to learning Spanish or French”, according to Bermel, with the intricacies of Slavonic grammar posing problems initially. But the Cyrillic alphabet used in Ukrainian is much easier to learn than people expect, he said. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has tweeted about his visit to the Wall of Remembrance in Kyiv with Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, where the pair laid flowers for those who died for Ukraine. The Polish premier’s visit comes as its president, Andrzej Duda, said his country has delivered the first Leopard tanks to Ukraine. Japan is considering new sanctions against Russia in line with moves by other Group of Seven (G7) countries, the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has said. Speaking before a call with other G7 leaders and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy scheduled later today, Kishida said he would present new ideas for sanctions but did not give any details. At a news conference to mark the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion, Kishida said Moscow was refusing to change its “hardline stance”, adding: The international community must come together and show solidarity and impose strong sanctions against Russia. Kishida, who will host the G7 summit in Hiroshima in May, said he was considering travelling to Ukraine in a show of solidarity. Japan tightened sanctions against Russia last month, including banning some exports and freezing the assets of Russian officials and entities. Japanese firms have however maintained stakes in Russian oil and gas projects seen as critical to Japan’s energy supplies. The Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, has said any “peace plan” to end the conflict must involve the withdrawal of Russian troops to the borders of 1991. Posting to Twitter, he said a ceasefire that would result in the continued occupation of Russian territory “isn’t about peace, but about freezing the war, Ukraine’s defeat, next stages of genocide”. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, has said his country has delivered its first Leopard tanks to Ukraine. Duda, speaking in his opening remarks at a meeting of the national security council in Warsaw, said he was happy that Poland was the first nation to offer the advanced tanks to Ukraine. Defence minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, also said at the council: The prime minister couldn’t be here, he went to Kyiv to bring Leopard tanks which are the first batch delivered to Ukraine. The government spokesperson, Piotr Müller, confirmed that the first Leopard tanks from Poland had gone to “our neighbours” in Ukraine. Poland has pledged 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. It was unclear how many tanks have been delivered. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, is in Kyiv today in a show of support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong taking over the live blog from Martin Belam. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has pledged to push for victory this year as Ukraine marks the sombre first anniversary of the Russian invasion, an event the president called “the longest day of our lives”. Funerals for the recently killed were taking place across the country on Friday morning alongside church services to commemorate the fallen, in a grim reminder of the relentless attrition of the continuing war. As morning broke on a day of commemorations and reflection, Zelenskiy struck a tone of grim defiance as he congratulated Ukrainians on their resilience in the face of Europe’s biggest and deadliest war since second world war. He said they had proven themselves to be invincible over “a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity”. Sitting at a desk, dressed in a blue sweatshirt with Ukraine’s trident emblem, Zelenskiy paid homage to cities that have become bywords for alleged Russian war crimes, such as Bucha, Irpin and Mariupol, describing them as “capitals of invincibility”. “We survived the first day of the full-scale war. We didn’t know what tomorrow would bring, but we clearly understood that for each tomorrow, you need to fight. And we fought,” he said in an early morning video address. The longest day of our lives. The hardest day of our modern history. We woke up early and haven’t fallen asleep since. Read the full story by my colleague Peter Beaumont: The UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has led the country in a minute of silence to mark the anniversary of the war in Ukraine. Sunak was joined outside No 10 by his wife, Akshata Murthy, Kyiv’s ambassador to Britain, Vadym Prystaiko, and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK for the national pause. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the military situation in Ukraine’s south is “quite dangerous” in some places while conditions in the east are “very difficult”. Speaking in a video address early on Friday on the first anniversary of the Russian invasion, the Ukrainian president said pro-Moscow forces had again shelled the southern city of Kherson, this time cutting off heat for 40,000 people. Zelenskiy delivered a sombre message of defiance to his people, saying “we will defeat everyone”. In a video titled “the year of invincibility”, he recalled how he addressed Ukrainians a year ago in a hurried statement, as Kyiv and the world reeled from Russia’s act of war. In a further address in Lithuania given via video link, Zelenskiy said Russia has to lose its war in Ukraine so it stops seeking to conquer territories it once controlled. “Russian revanchism must forever forget about Kyiv and Vilnius, about Chișinău and Warsaw, about our brothers in Latvia and Estonia, in Georgia and every other country that is now threatened,” he said. Russia’s Wagner group of mercenaries has taken full control of the Ukrainian village of Berkhivka, just north-west of Bakhmut, Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed on Telegram. The US has announced new military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia and its supporters, including Chinese companies, to demonstrate resolve on the anniversary. The military assistance package will include several new drone and anti-drone systems the US has not previously made available as well as equipment to help Ukraine counter Russian electronic warfare. The US commerce department will list over 80 companies from Russia, China and other countries accused of sanctions busting, including “backfill activities in support of Russia’s defence sector”, replenishing material that Moscow has used up in the invasion. China’s government has called for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians, in a statement which appeared to maintain Beijing’s stance that the west is fuelling the conflict and was dismissed as anodyne by analysts. The 12-point position paper on Ukraine was released on Friday morning. The paper, for which Ukraine was not consulted, was cautiously welcomed by Kyiv, but criticised by US officials and some analysts who noted the growing ties between China and Russia. On Wednesday, China’s top diplomat visited Moscow and pledged a deeper partnership. China’s call for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia “doesn’t have much credibility” the secretary-general of Nato Jens Stoltenberg has said, as he warned China against supplying arms to the Kremlin war machine. Stoltenberg told reporters “China doesn’t have much credibility because they have not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine and they also signed just days before the invasion an agreement between President Xi and President Putin on a limitless partnership with Russia.” Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said on Friday more talks between parliamentary groups were needed before Hungary’s ratification of Finland and Sweden’s Nato membership, which lawmakers will start debating next Wednesday. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, went to Kyiv on Friday in a show of support to Ukraine, government spokesperson Piotr Muller wrote on Twitter. Denmark is “open” to the idea of sending fighter jets to Ukraine to help its war effort against the Russian invasion, the Danish defence minister said on Friday. Britain is prepared to supply fighter jets to eastern European allies to enable them to release their Soviet fighters to Ukraine, defence secretary Ben Wallace has said. Wallace also said Britain is taking steps to rebuild its stockpiles of munitions which have been depleted by the war in Ukraine. Britain has imposed an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine, the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has announced. King Charles III has issued a message praising the “remarkable courage and resilience” of Ukraine’s people. Charles said in his message: “It has now been a year that the people of Ukraine have suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation. They have shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy.” The archbishop of Canterbury has said an end to the war in Ukraine cannot lead to Russia being treated like Germany after the first world war. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the only way for Moscow to eventually ensure a lasting peace with Ukraine was to push back its own borders as far as possible, “even if these are the borders of Poland.” That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I shall be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you shortly to continue our live coverage. World affairs editor Julian Borger reports for the Guardian: The US has announced new military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia and its supporters, including Chinese companies, to demonstrate resolve on the first anniversary of the full-scale Russian invasion. The military assistance package will include several new drone and anti-drone systems the US has not previously made available as well as equipment to help Ukraine counter Russian electronic warfare. The new drone include the Switchblade -600, a bigger version of this loitering munition (or “kamikaze drone”) than has already been supplied, as well as the CyberLux K8, Altius-600, and the Jump-20, which can be used for surveillance or adapted to carry bombs. The US will also send more ammunition for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (Himars) and 155mm howitzer guns Washington has provided over the course of the year. The US commerce department will list over 80 companies from Russia, China and other countries accused of sanctions busting, including “backfill activities in support of Russia’s defence sector”, replenishing material that Moscow has used up in the invasion. The Biden administration has become increasingly vocal about Chinese aid to the Russian war machine, and has raised concerns recently that Beijing is contemplating supplying weapons directly. The companies named would be blocked from purchasing hi-tech items like semiconductors made in the US, or using US technology abroad. Tariffs will be raised on imports from Russia of more than 100 metals, minerals, and chemical products, including aluminum smelt or cast in Russia, worth an estimated $2.8bn in revenue to Moscow. Other measures will be taken in concert with the G7 group of nations, including sanctions on over 200 individuals and entities in Russia, as well as Europe, Asia and the Middle East deemed to be supporting the Russian war effort. In that list are a dozen Russian financial institutions as well as Russian officials. The G7 will also set up an “enforcement coordination mechanism” to stop evasion of G7 sanctions already imposed. The US has this week begun disbursing $9.9bn in financial assistance to help fund healthcare, education, and emergency services, while the G7 as a whole has increased its commitment of budget and economic support to $39bn for this year. Part of the US assistance will be a third delivery by the energy department of equipment to help patch the Ukrainian power grid equipment which has been weakened by repeated Russian missile attacks over the course of the year. Britain’s King Charles III has issued a message marking the first anniversary of the conflict in Ukraine praising the “remarkable courage and resilience” of the nation’s people. PA Media reports Charles said in his message: “It has now been a year that the people of Ukraine have suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation. They have shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy. “The world has watched in horror at all the unnecessary suffering inflicted upon Ukrainians, many of whom I have had the great pleasure of meeting here in the UK and, indeed, across the world, from Romania to Canada. “Earlier this month I met President Zelenskiy at Buckingham Palace to express my personal support for the people of Ukraine. It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time. “Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, marked the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion on Friday with a sombre message of defiance to his people, saying “we will defeat everyone”. In a video released to the media titled “the year of invincibility”, he recalled how he addressed Ukrainians a year ago in a hurried statement, as Kyiv and the world reeled from Russia’s act of war. Here is a clip … Here is a striking image from Serbia, where a pro-Ukrainian activist Čedomir Stojković has tried to deliver a bloody cake decorated with a skull to the Russian embassy in Belgrade. The US has announced an additional package of security assistance for Ukraine. In a statement the Biden administration said that it would include “ several new Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) equipment to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences … and electronic warfare detection equipment to bolster Ukraine’s ability to repel Russia’s aggression.” The statement says “The package also includes a large amount of ammunition for 155mm artillery systems and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) that have proved so effective on the battlefield, as well as mine clearing equipment and secure communications support equipment.” Reuters reports that it has seen a draft document that suggests the US is also poised to announce for financial support for Moldova. Nick Ames and Larisa Kalik look today for us at the impact the war has had on the world of football in Ukraine. Among others, they spoke to Obolon Kyiv’s goalkeeper Nazariy Fedorivskyi. He had this to say: Football unites. That has never been clearer than over the past year. It was so important that we could restart our league to give people an outlet outside of Russia’s invasion: something to watch and enjoy, even if not inside the stadiums, that brought people together. We hope that fans of our club, Obolon Kyiv, have been given some pleasure: we are top of the second tier, about to finish the mid-season break, and hope we can finish the job with promotion back to the top flight. That is only part of what football can give. As players we have all adapted, trying to help, volunteer and donate in any way we can. I run a store in Kyiv that sells trainers and we have diverted a lot of our activities towards helping the military effort. Only last week we ran a charity event to raise funds for army dogs, while a percentage of every sale we make goes directly to the army. My family have remained here ever since Russia invaded. They try to help too: my mum has a big company that makes fabric for military uniforms. My father was on Maidan Nezalezhnosti in 2013 during the Euromaidan protests and we all know what we are working so hard for.

During a visit to Estonia, Jens Stoltenberg was asked about China’s 12-point position paper on Ukraine, which calls for the international community to “create conditions and platforms” for negotiations to resume. Stoltenberg told reporters “China doesn’t have much credibility because they have not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine and they also signed just days before the invasion an agreement between President Xi and President Putin on a limitless partnership with Russia.” He added that “military support today is the way to achieve a peaceful agreement tomorrow” in a rebuke to China’s implied criticism of western weapons for Ukraine. And he warned China against supplying Russia with weapons, saying it would be tantamount to supporting Russia’s illegal war of aggression, thereby violating the UN Charter. “We are monitoring closely what China is doing and we have seen signs that they may be considering sending lethal aid to Russia … this would be a very big mistake.” The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, also gave a cool response to the Chinese paper. “You have to see [the Chinese statement of principles] against a specific backdrop and that is the backdrop that China has taken a side, by signing, for example, an unlimited friendship right before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine started,” she said. The EU would look at the paper against that backdrop, she added. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne reports that about 2,000 people held a demonstration near the Russian consulate in the Romanian city of Constanta. It posted to its official Telegram channel to say: About 2,000 Ukrainians are present at the event, including many from Kherson. The event began with the national anthem of Ukraine. Then the participants honoured the memory of the dead with a moment of silence. They also called out “Kherson is Ukraine”, “Donbas is Ukraine”, hung up posters, and laid out toys with photos of children killed in the conflict. Services will be held across the world today to remember those who have lost their lives in the war. Here are some images from Copenhagen and London. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, went to Kyiv on Friday in a show of support to Ukraine, government spokesperson Piotr Muller wrote on Twitter. Morawiecki and the Ukrainian prime minister laid flowers at the wall of remembrance of those who died for Ukraine, Reuters reports the chancellery of the prime minister said in a statement. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been taking part in a ceremony in Kyiv to commemorate the one year anniversary of Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine. Denmark is “open” to the idea of sending fighter jets to Ukraine to help its war effort against the Russian invasion, the Danish defence minister said on Friday, according to state broadcaster DR. “I won’t rule out that at some point it may be necessary to look at the contribution of fighter jets,” Reuters reports acting defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen said. Russia has to lose its war in Ukraine so it stops seeking to conquer territories it once controlled, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in an address in Lithuania given via video link. “Russian revanchism must forever forget about Kyiv and Vilnius, about Chișinău and Warsaw, about our brothers in Latvia and Estonia, in Georgia and every other country that is now threatened,” Reuters reports the Ukrainian president said. Britain is prepared to supply fighter jets to eastern European allies to enable them to release their Soviet fighters to Ukraine, defence secretary Ben Wallace has said. Nato allies have been reluctant to release modern western warplanes to Kyiv, arguing that it will take too long to train aircrew. PA Media reports Wallace told Times Radio: “The other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets – MiG 29s or Su-24s – if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result. “They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn’t.” Wallace also said Britain is taking steps to rebuild its stockpiles of munitions which have been depleted by the war in Ukraine. “This Ukraine war and the way Russia is fighting has shown across the west that our stockpiles over the last three decades have often borne the brunt of defence cuts and we have to restock those,” he told Sky News. “We have now started to place orders to replenish them and where we haven’t placed orders we have started the work to make sure we have the supply chain or find alternative sources.” The defence secretary added that Russia has been forced to adopt a “meat-grinder approach” after its forces failed to make a breakthrough in Ukraine. He told listeners the Russian army was suffering “huge losses” on the battlefield for very little gain in territory. “It will move effectively to a meat-grinder approach where it just keeps sacrificing its own soldiers for the vanity of the Kremlin “That’s why we see huge losses amongst the Russian army and only gains, where we see gains, in metres not miles.” Some images have been released this morning that show Ukrainian troops and their UK military instructors commemorating lives lost during the invasion at Lydd army camp in Kent, England. Britain has imposed an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine, the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has announced. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said the internationally coordinated package of sanctions includes aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex. PA Media reports the UK is also sanctioning senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia’s two largest defence companies and four banks. Cleverly said: “Ukrainians are turning the tide on Russia but they cannot do it alone. That is why we must do more to help Ukraine win.” “Today we are sanctioning the elites who run Putin’s key industries and committing to prohibit the export to Russia of every item Russia has been found using on the battlefield.” The archbishop of Canterbury has said an end to the war in Ukraine cannot lead to Russia being treated like Germany after the first world war. Justin Welby, writing in the Daily Telegraph as Ukraine marks the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion, also said Kyiv must not be forced into a “Munich Agreement-like compromise”, a reference to the doomed settlement that failed to prevent the second world war. “Provided a just peace between Russia and Ukraine can be achieved, there must be a security structure that makes another war unlikely,” he said. “Russia cannot end up like Germany after 1919; it must be able to recover and be secure without being allowed to repeat its aggression. “The great powers must find ways, ideally through a conference, to design the conditions for long-term security, as was done in 1945. Today, it must be done for a new century, including UN reform, while the cost of conflict is fading from most European memories.” The treaty of Versailles, signed in Paris in 1919, was seen as humiliating by many Germans, and some historians argue that it created an enduring bitterness that helped the Nazis rise to power. But Welby also urged world leaders not to force Ukraine into an “unjust peace”, as he spoke about the impact of visiting Kyiv. Read more here: Welby calls for just peace between Russia and Ukraine on war anniversary Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the only way for Moscow to eventually ensure a lasting peace with Ukraine was to push back its own borders as far as possible. Medvedev, a longtime ally of Putin and deputy chair of Russia’s security council, posted to the Telegram app to say: It’s been a year since the special operation has been going on. A year since our servicemen restore order, peace and justice in our land, protect our people and destroy the roots of neo-nazism. Victory will be achieved. We all want this to happen as soon as possible. And that day will come. We will return our territories and reliably protect our people, who have suffered during the years of genocide and shelling. Then there will be negotiations, which, I am sure, will become difficult and nervous. First of all, because the formal participants in the negotiations on the part of our enemy are one, and the actual leaders are completely different. And decisions for the Kyiv regime will, of course, not be made by some kind of Zelenskiy, if he is still alive, or his clique. The decision will be made across the ocean. By those in whose hands the supply of weapons to Kyiv and the allocation of money to maintain the remains of the Ukrainian economy. It is so important to achieve all the goals of the special military operation. Push the borders of threats to our country as far as possible, even if these are the borders of Poland. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said the notion that China could supply arms to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would not help resolve the conflict, an outcome he was confident China wanted. “It can’t help the peace if China effectively supplies the one nation that has broken the international law on the sovereignty of Ukraine and been inflicting war crimes,” Wallace told Sky News on Friday when asked about reports China could supply weapons to Russia. “But I’m also confident that China is pretty clear that it wants this [war] to stop,” Reuters reports he added. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said on Friday more talks between parliamentary groups were needed before Hungary’s ratification of Finland and Sweden’s Nato membership, which lawmakers will start debating next Wednesday. Reuters reports that, speaking on public radio, Orbán said he had asked lawmakers of his nationalist Fidesz party to support their bid, adding however that some deputies were “not very enthusiastic” about the expansion and sought further discussions on the matter. Orbán added that in the end, it should be made clear that Hungary supports Finland and Sweden’s Nato membership, but said Turkey’s concerns regarding Sweden’s entry should also be heard, otherwise the expansion effort could fail. “Regarding Turkey, they are also our allies, and therefore we need to hear their voice,” Orbán said. Ankara claims Stockholm has harboured what Turkey calls members of terrorist groups and recently indicated it would approve only Finland for Nato membership at present. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has posted to the Telegram messaging app to mark a year since the beginning of the war. He writes: Friends! We have been living in a new reality for a year. Tragic and psychologically exhausting. But we are fighting, we believe in ourselves and our country. Therefore, we will overcome everything and win. A year ago, Russia’s resolution of this barbaric war seemed unreal to most Ukrainians. But the capital was preparing for a possible offensive. Volunteers had joined the ranks of territorial defence [and] our military helped protect and hold the capital. The city’s critical infrastructure worked despite shelling and the real threat of street fighting. Hospitals received the wounded from the suburbs, where fierce battles were fought. Grocery stores and community pharmacies stayed open. Businesses and caring citizens of Kyiv provided support to those who needed it. Photojournalists Alessio Mamo, Anastasia Taylor-Lind, Ed Ram and Anastasia Vlasova have covered the situation in Ukraine since the Russian invasion last February. My colleague Lorenzo Tondo spoke to them about their experiences for this photo essay. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne reports that overnight the city of Slovyansk in Donetsk was shelled by Russian forces. It says “private houses were damaged by shelling” but there were no reports of any injuries as a result. Former British prime minister Gordon Brown writes for the Guardian today, saying that ‘we owe it to the people of Ukraine to bring Vladimir Putin to trial for war crimes’: Special tribunals have been promoted by the US before. Exactly 30 years ago, with the US’s endorsement, the UN security council created the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. One year later, it supported the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda. An agreement between the government of Sierra Leone and the UN led to an independent special court and, with the assistance of the UN, special tribunals were created for Cambodia and Lebanon with US support. But the most obvious parallel is the decision made by nine European allies that met in London in 1942 and drafted a resolution on German aggression, which led, at the war’s end, and with American support, to the creation of the international military tribunal and the trials of Nazi war criminals. The trial of Japanese war criminals followed. Those who say prosecutions like this do not work should remember not only the verdicts of Nuremberg and Tokyo, but also that the notorious former president of Liberia, Charles Taylor, languishes in a British prison after a 50-year sentence was imposed upon him in 2012 for atrocities committed on his instruction in Sierra Leone. A similar verdict was likely to be imposed on the butcherous Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević, who was being tried in The Hague for war crimes when he died of a heart attack in his prison cell. And war tribunals can sentence criminals in their absence, making it difficult for them ever to travel abroad again. Read more here: Gordon Brown – We owe it to the people of Ukraine to bring Vladimir Putin to trial for war crimes First Edition, the Guardian’s daily briefing email, today features Archie Bland speaking to Patrick Wintour, our diplomatic editor, about the anniversary of the war and the way the world has responded to it. Here is an excerpt: “Global south” is a “rather overused phrase”, Patrick said. It refers to such a varied group of countries – from India’s 1.4 billion people to African states with populations in the low millions – that any attempt to view them as uniform is bound to fall short. Still, it is clear that most of these countries are sceptical of joining western support of Ukraine, and see the war as a proxy conflict between world powers with an eye on the US’s history of military interventions and European imperialism as context rather than a necessary moral crusade. The recent debate between allies over whether or not to provide Ukraine with tanks – which ended with a deal to send US and German-made armour and train Ukrainian soldiers to use it – is a decent miniature of the larger pattern in the west since the war began: serious disputes over the right approach, but agreement in the end. This week, Patrick said, Joe Biden’s trip to Ukraine and the Munich security conference have reinforced that narrative. “The thing I drew from Munich, and then the Biden visit, is the degree to which the west has remained united in the face of the likelihood of a long war. The signs of fissure that we might have expected, with France and Germany as reluctant warriors in opposition to the Baltic nations, haven’t really materialised. I don’t think there’s an influential ‘peace party’ operating in Europe.” Read more here: Friday briefing – Ukraine’s allies are settling in for the long haul as the war enters its second year Paris lit up the Eiffel Tower in the blue and yellow colours of the Ukraine flag on Thursday night in a show of support to Ukraine and to mark the first anniversary of the war. Ukrainian ambassador to France, Vadym Omelchenko, spoke at the event. A couple of pictures of how it unfolded can be seen below. Over the course of the last year, Putin has “met the bravery of Ukraine and the iron will of nations everywhere,” Joe Biden has said as the world marks the anniversary of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Biden also said that Nato, which Putin thought “would fracture and divide” is “stronger and more unified than ever before”. In another one of the conflict’s defining images, the bridge that linked Crimea to Russia burns after a truck bomb exploded on 8 October. The Kerch Bridge was a personal Putin prestige project and the hit came the day after his 70th birthday. The blast destroyed the road into Crimea and left the railway link in flames. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for the attack at the time, but s senior Ukrainian official posted a “happy birthday” message with images of destruction, and the country’s post office revealed – within hours – designs for a commemorative stamp, showing the bridge ablaze, raising questions about whether the explosion had been anticipated. Russia’s Wagner group of mercenaries has taken full control of the Ukrainian village of Berkhivka, just north-west of Bakhmut, Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin said a few minutes ago on Telegram. The Guardian has not verified this independently. How will the war in Ukraine develop during 2023? The Guardian has asked a panel of experts to weigh in. Russian investigative journalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan say we are in for a long fight. This war is going to last for a very long time – that feeling dawned on Russians at the end of 2022. Most of those who wanted to leave the country have already left. The rest, the thinking part of the population, will try to adjust to the circumstances in a state where even children are subject to compulsory propaganda in schools. In 2023, the added feeling will be fear of those who enthusiastically went to war and now are getting back. Many will be angry and frustrated, and capable of further violence. People will switch to a quiet survival strategy – something familiar to Russians who remember the Soviet Union. There will be an exodus into domestic life, to quiet conversations in kitchens, to a habit of being cautious about what you say publicly and on the phone or on social media. In short, keeping one’s head down. The body bags arriving in Russian cities and towns will not add to sympathy for the plight of Ukrainians. The rest of the panel’s responses are here: Buildings and monuments across Ukraine have been illuminated in blue and yellow lights to commemorate the victims of Russia’s invasion. In Kyiv, the main post office was lit up overnight during a light projection by Swiss artist Gerry Hofstetter. Hofstetter is performing an art tour of the cities of Ukraine with illumination of buildings and monuments commemorating the full-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine. The UK Ministry of Defence has posted its daily update. Today, it tracks Russia’s changing tactics since 2014, as it changed from subversion to invasion. “In recent weeks, Russia has likely changed its approach again. Its campaign now likely primarily seeks to degrade the Ukrainian military, rather than being focused on seizing substantial new territory,” the ministry says. “The Russian leadership is likely pursuing a long-term operation”. Here is the full update: Since 2014 Russia’s strategic goal in Ukraine has highly likely been consistent: to control its neighbour. Over 2014-2021, it pursued this objective through subversion, by fomenting an undeclared war in the Donbas, and by annexing Crimea. On 24 February 2022, Russia pivoted to a new approach and launched a full-scale invasion which attempted to seize the whole country and depose its government. By April 2022, Russia realised this had failed, and focused on expanding and formalising its rule over the Donbas and the south. It has made slow and extremely costly progress. In recent weeks, Russia has likely changed its approach again. Its campaign now likely primarily seeks to degrade the Ukrainian military, rather than being focused on seizing substantial new territory. The Russian leadership is likely pursuing a long-term operation where they bank that Russia’s advantages in population and resources will eventually exhaust Ukraine. Zelenskiy has released a video as part of his message on the morning of the one year anniversary of the war: China’s government has presented itself as a neutral party, one capable of easing tensions between Russia and Ukraine. However it has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, instead blaming the west for inflaming tensions, and some senior officials have repeatedly voiced explicit support for Russia’s aims. This week the US government said it has intelligence suggesting Beijing is considering supplying weapons to Russia, and on Friday a report by Der Spiegel claimed Moscow was in negotiations with a Chinese company about supplying large quantities of strike drones. On Friday Beijing also abstained – for the fourth time – from a UN vote demanding Russia withdraw from Ukraine. Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the US-based German Marshall Fund, said the paper was largely a summary of its previously stated positions and statements, which were “replete with contradictions”. “Beijing claims to support Ukraine’s sovereignty, but it has not criticised Russia’s annexations of Ukrainian territory,” Glaser said. Glaser also noted the last of the 12 points, which states China stood ready to help in post-conflict reconstruction, “sounds like China is keen to get its [state-owned enterprises] into Ukraine, both to make a profit and promote Chinese influence via commercial and economic means”: More now on China’s position paper on Ukraine, released a few hours ago. China’s government has called for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians, in a statement which appeared to maintain Beijing’s stance that the west is fuelling the conflict and was dismissed as anodyne by analysts. The 12-point position paper on Ukraine was released on Friday morning, on the one year anniversary of Russia’s invasion, and ahead of an expected speech by Xi Jinping. The paper, for which Ukraine was not consulted, was cautiously welcomed by Kyiv, but criticised by US officials and some analysts who noted the growing ties between China and Russia. On Thursday China’s top diplomat visited Moscow and pledged a deeper partnership. The paper stated that the international community should “create conditions and platforms” for negotiations to resume, and claimed that China would continue to “play a constructive role in this regard”.  The paper did not address its suggestions to a particular side in the conflict, instead calling for all parties to “stay rational and exercise restraint”, and to “strictly abide by international humanitarian law, avoid attacking civilians or civilian facilities, protect women, children and other victims of the conflict”. Some of the language appeared to be directed at the west. The paper warned against “expanding military blocs”, an apparent reference to Nato, and urged all parties to “avoid fanning the flames and aggravating tensions”, mirroring language that Beijing officials have repeatedly used to criticise the US’s support of Ukraine. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has just posted on Telegram saying, “On 24 February, millions of us made a choice. Not a white flag, but a blue and yellow flag. Not fleeing, but facing. Facing the enemy. Resistance and struggle. “It was a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity. And this is a year of our invincibility. We know that this will be the year of our victory!” After a 30% contraction in its economy in 2022, Ukraine will need $38bn by the end of year to cover its budget deficit alone, Reuters reports. “We need these funds for critical costs: funding of salaries and pensions, education and medicine,” prime minister Denys Shmyhal told a recent government meeting. “For economic stability and a successful fight against the enemy, Ukraine needs more help.” On top of that, Kyiv has said it will need $17bn this year for urgent energy repairs and de-mining, and rebuilding some of its critical infrastructure. The European Union is expected to provide the lion’s share of funds, at $18bn, to cover the budget deficit. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stepped up calls on Thursday for increased financial support to Ukraine as the United States readies an additional $10bn in economic assistance. Kyiv has yet to identify sources of funding to meet those additional costs. It is now pressing for a multibillion-dollar borrowing programme from the International Monetary Fund, with prime minister Denys Shmyhal saying he hopes to agree a $15bn multi-year program. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said on Tuesday lending to Ukraine could be “sizeable”. Ukraine’s military has just released its latest operational report as of 6am this morning, claiming Russian forces launched strikes on dozens of settlements across Ukraine’s south and north-east in the past day. Russian troops fired at more than 22 settlements in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region as well as more than 20 settlements in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, according to the latest intelligence report from Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces. Russia conducted “several unsuccessful offensive actions” including on the sought-after eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut, the military said. About 25 settlements in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region also reportedly fell under artillery shelling. The military also said mobile operators had disconnected access to the internet across some temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region. In some areas of the temporarily occupied territories of the Luhansk region, mobile operators have disconnected access to the Internet network in order to prevent the transmission of data on the actions of Russian occupation troops and the fight against the patriotic Ukrainian population. Disruption of the Internet network must take place in all temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region.” “Russian warship, go fuck yourself”: these may be the most famous five words said in the war. Ukrainian soldiers defending an island in the Black Sea from an air and sea bombardment reportedly told an officer on board a Russian navy warship to “go fuck yourself” when asked to surrender on 25 February 2022. There were 13 border guards stationed on Snake Island, a roughly 16-hectare (40-acre) rocky island owned by Ukraine that sits about 186 miles (300km) west of Crimea, when Russian troops bombed the island on Thursday. The exchange went like this, my colleague Luke Harding reported later: Russian warship: “Snake Island. I, Russian warship, repeat the offer: lay down your arms and surrender, or you will be bombed. Have you understood me? Do you copy?” First border guard to second border guard: “Well, that’s it then. Or do we need to tell them back to fuck off?” Second border guard to first border guard: “Might as well.” First border guard: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.” Soon after the conversation, the Ukrainian military command lost contact with the island. It assumed all of its defenders had been killed. But days later it emerged that they had surrendered and were prisoners of war. They were freed in March that year. In the meantime, Harding writes, the phrase “became a national slogan, a global meme and a symbol of Ukraine’s heroic defiance in the face of Russian aggression.” You can read the full story of what happened to the men in Snake Island here: G20 financial leaders must condemn Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Reuters in an interview on Friday. Speaking on the first day of the G20 financial leaders meeting in Bengaluru, Le Maire also said that Europe was “thinking and working on new sanctions on Russia”. Here is a video of the UN’s vote earlier on Russia withdrawing from Ukraine. The United Nations overwhelmingly isolated Russia by calling for a “comprehensive, just and lasting peace”, demanding Russia withdraw its troops from Ukraine and stop fighting. Marking one year since Moscow’s invasion, the resolution was adopted with 141 votes in favour and 32 abstentions. Six countries joined Russia to vote no: Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua and Syria. China abstained from the vote – accusing the west of “adding fuel to the fire” – a day after Beijing’s top diplomat visited Moscow and pledged a deeper partnership with Russia: On 9 March, two weeks after the invasion began, Russian forces bombed a maternity hospital in Mariupol. The image of Mariana Vishegirskaya, heavily pregnant in cheerful pyjamas, her face smeered with blood, became a beacon of Russia’s ruthlessness. Vishegirskaya was later targeted by a Russia disinformation campaign accusing her of faking the injuries. The Russian embassy in London claimed in a series of tweets that Vishegirskaya had been employed as an actor to stage the photos, including a photo of a completely different woman being stretchered out of the hospital. On 11 March, she gave birth to a baby girl. Let’s take a look at some of the images that have captured the events of the last year. The first is Zelenskiy addressing Ukrainians on 24 February 2022. Appearing shortly after midnight, Ukraine’s president urged Putin to, “Listen to the voice of reason”. “The Ukrainian people want peace,” he said. Later that day, as Russia launched strikes accross the country, hitting 16 cities, Zelenskiy spoke again. Putin “wants to destroy our country, and everything we have been building. But we know the strength of the Ukrainian people,” he said. A few days later, Zelenskiy walked streets of Kyiv’s government district defiantly, proving that, contrary to rumours he had fled, he was still in the country – where he would remain for almost the entire first year of the war. Today on the Guardian’s Today in Focus podcast: searching for the first casualty of the war in Ukraine. Denys Tkach was killed in the early hours of 24 February 2022, an hour and twenty minutes before Putin announced a “special military operation” in Ukraine. He was serving on a military checkpoint near the village of Zorynivka in the eastern Luhansk region. Was this the moment that the war really began? The Guardian’s chief reporter Daniel Boffey has been looking into what happened in the final hours of his life. He tells Michael Safi about meeting people who knew Tkach and learning about the complicated consequences of his death. Ukraine has responded to China’s publication of a position paper on ending the war, saying it is a “good sign and a sign that China wants to be involved in the global efforts to stop the war in Ukraine,” Reuters reports, citing Leshchynska Zhanna, the charge d’affaires at the Ukrainian embassy in China. Zhanna also called for China offering more support to Ukraine, saying, “Ukraine would like to see China on its side, at the moment hina is not supporting Ukraine efforts.” Ukraine has a peace plan which it hopes China supports, she said. Earlier this week, Zelenskiy said that he had not been shown what was then being referred to as China’s ‘peace plan’, but that he would be open to a meeting with Chinese leaders. In cities around the world, people are protesting and commemorating the war. In New York, a silent candlelight vigil took place front of the Russian embassy on Thursday night. Ukrainian refugees and locals gathered for a ceremony in the village of Grabie, Wieliczka, Poland. Closer to home, a commemoration event took place at the Lychakiv military cemetery in Lviv, Ukraine, where family members visited the graves of fallen soldiers. Here are some of the pictures: Here is the full story on Shakhtar Donetsk’s thrilling – and very well-timed – Europa League win: Hi, Helen Sullivan back with you. Some US lawmakers have expressed displeasure with South Africa’s decision to host joint military exercises with Russia and China on the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but said it would not scupper health partnerships between the two countries. South Africa’s 10-day joint naval exercises with Russia and China, which are being held off South Africa’s country’s east coast and which South Africa has called routine, have fuelled domestic criticism and fears that the drills will endanger important relations with western partners. Republican US Senator Lindsey Graham said any country that does such exercises are “gonna have problems,” but added that ending his country’s 20-year-old US President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) programme aimed at HIV treatment and prevention could also hurt the United States. Graham was speaking at a press briefing in Johannesburg. Graham said he would work with the Republican caucus to have Pepfar reauthorised this year “despite the problems going on here in South Africa with the Russians.” Democratic Senator Chris Coons hinted that senators discussed the military exercises with South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, in a meeting on Wednesday, but added that “every other minute here has been about Pepfar.” Pandor’s spokesperson Lunga Ngqengelele confirmed that the meeting took place but could not immediately confirm the discussions. I’ll hand you back to my colleague Helen Sullivan who will continue to deliver all the latest developments as the day unfolds. Before I go, here is a little more detail from US national security adviser Jake Sullivan’s interview with CNN this evening. Sullivan told the broadcaster that the US has vowed to do “everything in our power to get you the equipment and the ammunition” that Ukraine needs. That includes 155-millimetre artillery shells, 120-millimetre tank shells among other tools like Himars missiles. He said the US and Nato countries aim to increase ammunition for Ukraine “so that the total supply of each of these different forms of ammunition grows month by month and we can continue to move to the front lines.” He said countries are putting in “immense effort and resources” into ramping up ammunition, but noted that “this is not something we can do with the snap of a finger.” The US will provide Ukraine an additional $2bn in security assistance, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan has said. Sullivan made the announcement while speaking with the news broadcaster during a special live town hall to mark one year of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. Sullivan said US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy have had “deep conversations” about providing Ukraine with the weaponry and tools needed to fight the war against Russia. We’re going to continue to look at what is necessary, and make sure that we provide what is necessary that Ukraine has what it needs to succeed on the battlefield.” He said during Biden’s recent surprise visit to Ukraine, the US president “brought with him an announcement of more artillery, more ammunition, more Himars on the back of major announcements about American tanks and armoured vehicles.” Sullivan also mentioned recently announced security assistance for Ukraine, as well as more technology. We will keep working with them month by month to figure out if there are additional tools that they need,” Sullivan said. The European Council has released this statement on the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The European Union will continue to support Ukraine in political, economic, humanitarian, financial and military terms, including through swift coordinated procurement from European industry. We will also support Ukraine’s reconstruction, for which we will strive to use frozen and immobilised Russian assets in accordance with EU and international law. We will further increase collective pressure on Russia to end its war of aggression. To this end we will adopt a tenth sanctions package and we will take steps against those who attempt to circumvent EU measures. We support President Zelenskiy’s peace formula. Together with our international partners, we will make sure that Ukraine prevails, that international law is respected, that peace and Ukraine’s territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders are restored, that Ukraine is rebuilt, and that justice is done. Until that day, we will not rest.” Earlier, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen raised the Ukrainian flag in front of the EU Commission. Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you as my colleague Helen Sullivan takes a short break. As I reflect on one year of covering the Russia-Ukraine war, here is a short snippet of what I recall on 24 February, 2022: Putin’s forces invaded in an unprecedented pre-dawn attack that hit as most major European newsrooms were sleeping. It was about 2pm in Sydney when the first series of missiles were launched towards Kyiv. I was live-streaming the event when Putin announced his invasion. About an hour into the meeting when speakers took the floor to denounce Russia’s escalating tensions towards Ukraine, rumours began to circulate that an offensive against Ukraine had begun. Back in Russia, President Vladimir Putin went on television to announce a “special military operation” in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region had commenced. The first few hours of war were frantic as missiles began to rain down near Kyiv and Putin’s plan became clear. Handing over to my colleagues in London as Europe woke up to a new reality, I never imagined the war would dominate the news agenda one year on. US President Joe Biden will meet virtually on Friday with G7 leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to mark the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and announce new sanctions against those aiding Russia’s war effort, the White House said. The same group came together last year hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, imposing the first round of a series of sanctions, Reuters reports. “The G7 has become an anchor of our strong and united response to Russia,” White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. The leaders on Friday will discuss “how we continue supporting Ukraine” and ways to increase pressure on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine a year ago, she said. The sanctions will include Russian banks, technology and defense sectors, and will impact both people and companies involved in the conflict, according to Jean-Pierre. The US will also announce a fresh Ukrainian aid package that will include economic, security and energy support, she added. Japanese chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said on Friday that Japan, as chair of the G7, wants to strengthen G7 ties and show firm cooperation with Ukraine. Japan is set to host an online G7 summit later on Friday to discuss the conflict. We’re just getting the first look at what is inside China’s so-called “Peace plan” for Ukraine, which was notably not shared with Ukraine’s leaders. So far, it looks fairly unsurprising, noting the dangers of nuclear weapons, which should be avoided, stressing the need for negotiations, and saying that ‘“one country’s security cannot be at the expense of another country’s security”. But one thing stands out, which is that China says it is opposed to “any unilateral sanctions not authorised by UN security council”. Many countries have imposed their own sanctions against Russian products, including gas, selling products within Russia, and on wealthy Russians with links to the Kremlin. So it seems like the cat’s out of the bag on that one. The paper also warns that, “nuclear weapons cannot be used and nuclear war cannot be fought” Here are the dot points from the peace plan: Respect sovereignty of all countries Country’s security cannot be at expense of other countries’ security Regional security cannot be guaranteed by strengthening or even expanding military blocs Cease fire and stop fighting, prevent Ukraine crisis from further aggravating or even getting out of control Gradually promote de-escalation and easing of situation and finally reach comprehensive ceasefire Dialogue, negotiation are only viable way to resolve Ukraine crisis Maintain safety of nuclear power plants, oppose armed attacks on nuclear facilities Nuclear weapons cannot be used and nuclear war cannot be fought Prevent nuclear proliferation, avoid any nuclear crisis We oppose development, use of biological and chemical weapons by any country under any circumstances Oppose any unilateral sanctions not authorised by UN security council On Thursday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he had not seen any Chinese peace plan but he would welcome a meeting between Ukraine and China. “We would like to meet with China,” he said during a news briefing in Kyiv with the visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, on the eve of the first anniversary the invasion. Here is Zelenskiy on 25 February 2022, the day after Russia had invaded: More now on the significance of the UN general assembly’s resolution calling for Russia to withdraw from Ukraine, via AP. The General Assembly has become the most important UN body dealing with Ukraine because the Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, is paralyzed by Russia’s veto power. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, unlike Security Council resolutions, but serve as a barometer of world opinion. In joyful news: the Ukrainian football team that has not played in their home city since 2014, qualified for the knockout stages of the Europa League on Thursday with coach Igor Jovicevic hailing the win at French side Rennes as a “victory for Ukraine.” AFP reports that Shakhtar defeated Rennes 5-4 in a penalty shootout after their playoff had ended 3-3 on aggregate and then went to extra-time. The win comes on the first anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “It was very important. This match was for you, Ukraine, it was for our country, for Ukraine,” said Croatian national Jovicevic who has worked in Ukraine for more than 20 years. “I can’t find the words at the moment, we were in the game until the end,” he added. “You could almost say that we died on the pitch, that we left our arms and legs there. This victory is a reward for our work.” The BBC’s correspondent for eastern Europe, Sarah Rainsford, has posted this picture taken the day before Russia invaded. “The night before war. Everyone was nervous, but didn’t really believe what was coming. I barely slept that night,” she writes. “We were woken by the explosions.” Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine has reported that Russia is in talks with a Chinese manufacturer about buying 100 drones for use in the war, with a delivery date of April, but has not cited any specific sources. Over the past week the US has suggested China may be considering supplying weapons to Russia, while warning that any such move would have severe consequences. Beijing has denied this, saying they would continue to take “an objective and impartial stance” on the conflict. Der Spiegel said a Chinese drone manufacturer was prepared to make 100 prototypes of a model that they claim could carry a 35-50kg warhead. It claims the drone is similar to Iran’s Shaheed-136, which Russia has used to launch countless attacks on Ukraine, claiming hundreds of lives and damaging civilian infrastructure. Moldova’s government has dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry that Ukraine is planning to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria after staging a false-flag operation. “We call for calm and for information to be received [by the public] from official and credible sources of the Republic of Moldova,” the government said in a statement. “Our institutions cooperate with foreign partners and in the case of threats to the country, the public will be promptly informed,” adding that the government “do not confirm” the Russian defence ministry’s allegations. On Thursday, Russia’s defence ministry claimed Ukraine – which borders Moldova – posed “a direct threat” to Russian troops in the Russian-speaking region. At least 137,780 Russian military personnel have died in the war so far, according to the Ukrainian military, with around 824Russian soldiers dying a day this month, a marked increase from recent months and a figure not seen since the start of the war. A recent estimate by the US military said that each side had probably suffered about 100,000 deaths and injuries, putting the total number of deaths and casualties for Russia and Ukraine at 200,000. Russia’s own figure for casualties is far lower than the Ukrainian estimate, with The Conversation pointing out this month that Russia has provided only two official reports since the start of the war. “The most recent was on 21 September 2022, when defence minister Sergei Shoigu said that 5,937 Russian troops had been killed. Mediazona, an independent Russian publication which is working with the BBC News Russian service to monitor the death toll, puts the figure at 12,538 deaths. So the numbers vary wildly from source to source.” Ukraine has also refrained from providing casualty figures, but in August last year, the armed forces’ commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said that 9,000 have died. As security studies expert Lily Hamourtziadou explains in the conversation: Casualty reporting is a powerful tool of war propaganda, seen most starkly in the tit-for-tat accounts of two incidents around the new year. Ukraine claimed that its rocket attack on a Russian army barracks in Makiivka near Donetsk in the east of Ukraine on New Year’s Eve killed 400 Russian soldiers. Russia countered that the attack, while deadly, had killed only about 60 troops (although prominent pro-Moscow blogger and former military leader Igor Girkin reportedly claimed the death toll was in the hundreds). Here is more on the clash between Germany and China the UN on Thursday. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, clashed with Chinese diplomats on Thursday, passionately rejecting their claim that the west was adding fuel to the fire by arming Ukraine. Baerbock said it was time for China to tell Russia to stop its aggression. The deputy Chinese envoy to the UN, Dai Bing, insisted the west was worsening the situation by arming Ukraine, saying: “Adding fuel to the fire will only exacerbate tensions”. His remarks provoked Baerbock into a powerful rebuttal rejecting his claim that the west was indulging in military spending at the expense of other priorities more important to ordinary people. She asked: “Why on earth would we do that?”, adding: “We did not want this war. We did not choose this war.” She said her government “would much rather focus every bit of our energy and money in fixing our schools, in fighting the climate crisis and strengthening social justice”, adding: “The truth is that if Russia stops fighting, the war will end, If Ukraine stops this fighting, Ukraine ends.” She said the suffering, including “abduction, rape and torture”, would continue every day, and that the world’s gaping wounds, caused by hunger, inflation and energy shortages, would not end. In Australia, where Friday 24 February is well under way, the government has announced it would send more drones to Ukraine and impose new targeted financial sanctions against 90 Russian individuals and 40 entities. The latest targets include Russian ministers overseeing energy, resources and industry sectors, and key players in defence including arms manufacturer Kalashnikov Concern, aviation firm Tupolev and submarine developer Admiralty Shipyards. “We continue to stand with Ukraine,” prime minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement. “(The uncrewed aerial systems) provide a battlefield intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability for the Ukrainian Armed Forces.” He did not specify how many drones would be shipped, the models involved, and whether they would be armed. The UN has overwhelmingly voted to call for Russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Ukraine, marking one year since Moscow’s invasion by calling for a “comprehensive, just and lasting peace”. The resolution on Thursday night saw 141 countries in favour with seven against and 32 abstentions, including China. The Chinese deputy envoy to the UN, Dai Bing, said the west was throwing fuel on to the fire by arming Ukraine. That would only exacerbate tensions, he said. Leading the abstention camp, he claimed: “One year into the Ukraine crisis, the conflict is still grinding on and growing in scale, wreaking havoc to countless lives. A spillover effect is intensifying. We are deeply worried about this. China’s position on the Ukraine issue is consistent and clear. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected. The purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be observed. The legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously.” His remarks provoked a powerful rebuttal from Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, rejecting his claim that the west was indulging in military spending at the expense of other priorities more important to ordinary people. She said it was specious to claim the military aid was worsening the crisis since if the west did not supply aid, the aggressor would be free to capture Ukraine and destroy the UN Charter. The military situation in Ukraine’s south is quite dangerous in some places while conditions in the east are very difficult, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a video address early on Friday. Zelenskiy, speaking on the first anniversary of the Russian invasion, said pro-Moscow forces had again shelled the southern city of Kherson, this time cutting off heat for 40,000 people. “As for the south – in some places the situation is quite dangerous but our troops have the means to respond to the occupiers,” he said, summarising events on the various fronts. “In the east – it’s very difficult, painful. But we are doing everything to withstand it,” he continued, in reference to repeated attacks by Russian forces seeking to capture the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Zelenskiy said repair work in Kherson, which is being shelled on a daily basis, would continue until heat was restored. “And we will rebuild. No matter what these Russian terrorists and bastards may do, we will rebuild and restore everything,” he said. On Friday morning, Ukrainians will wake up to an anniversary like no other: a year since Russia invaded their country and began a campaign of terror, striking civilian areas, targeting critical infrastructure and weaponising the freezing cold. Russia has been accused of war crimes including torture, raping women and children and carrying out mass executions. At least 8,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed, though the true number is likely much higher. This figure includes 487 children. The war has turned more than eight million Ukrainians into refugees. Today, we will be looking back at the first year of the war in Ukraine, as well as reporting the day’s news and analysis on what might come next. My name is Helen Sullivan, and I’ll be bringing you news, photos and analysis throughout the day. If you would like to get in touch, the best place to find me is on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Here are the key recent developments in the war: Ukraine is bracing for possible fresh Russian attacks on key cities amid fears that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, intends to mark the anniversary with a series of strikes. Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces had stepped up attacks along the eastern frontline and its forces had repelled 90 assaults in the east and north-east in the past 24 hours. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said the alliance has seen signs that China is considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against taking any such step. Stoltenberg said potential Chinese assistance would amount to providing direct “support to a blatant violation of international law, and of course [as] a member of the UN security council China should not in any way support violation of the UN charter or international law.” Vladimir Putin has said Russia will deploy its new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, nicknamed “Satan 2”, as well as roll out hypersonic missiles and new nuclear submarines. In an address to mark the “Defender of the Fatherland” holiday on Thursday, Putin said Russia would “pay increased attention” to boost its nuclear forces on land, sea and in the air. Spain will send Ukraine six Leopard tanks and is willing to increase that number to 10 if necessary, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, confirmed during a visit to Kyiv on Thursday. “We will stay by Ukraine’s side until peace returns to Europe,” he said, adding that Spain had offered to train Ukrainian soldiers in how to use the tanks. Finland will send three Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, the country’s defence ministry has said. The announcement comes after Sweden’s defence minister said it was open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks. The Czech government has also announced a further military aid shipment to Ukraine. A US army official has said it could take up to two years for M1 Abrams tanks to be delivered to Ukraine. The US announced in January that it would supply Ukraine with 31 advanced M1 Abrams tanks worth $400m in a matter of months. But plans were still being drawn up on how and when they would be delivered, the US army secretary, Christine Wormuth, said. The EU’s top diplomats have failed to finalise the bloc’s tenth round of sanctions against Russia, which would ban the sale of more military-critical technologies. Talks are understood to be stuck on the question of rubber trade with Russia. The US president, Joe Biden, will meet virtually on Friday with G7 leaders and Volodymyr Zelenskiy to announce new sanctions against those aiding Russia’s war effort, the White House says."

                    "headline": "Polish Leopard tanks arrive in Ukraine as west piles new sanctions on Russia",
                    "bodyText": "The first Polish Leopard tanks have arrived in Ukraine, as western allies including the G7 and EU announced a range of further economic, military and financial sanctions against Russia, in a renewed effort to weaken Vladimir Putin’s war machine. Speaking on the first anniversary of the Russian invasion, Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, confirmed that four Leopard tanks had been delivered to Ukraine. “Poland and Europe stand by your side. We will definitely not leave you, we will support Ukraine until complete victory over Russia,” he said, standing alongside the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during his visit to Kyiv. As ceremonies to remember the dead took place in Kyiv, western allies sought to demonstrate their support. Ukraine’s blue and yellow colours were projected on the Eiffel Tower, the Brandenburg Gate, the Empire State Building and EU headquarters, and were painted on the street by activists outside the Russian embassy in London. On Friday evening the G7 announced it was determined to strengthen sanctions and take unprecedented measures in order to weaken Russia, promising measures against Russian diamond exports, a controversial issue for Europe. It warned that third countries that help Russia evade sanctions would face “severe costs” and is understood to be setting up an “enforcement coordination mechanism” to stop evasion of G7 sanctions already imposed. In a joint statement, G7 leaders said: “We call on third-countries or other international actors who seek to evade or undermine our measures to cease providing material support to Russia’s war, or face severe costs.” Ahead of the G7 meeting, the US led the way with an announcement of further military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia and its supporters, including Chinese companies. The military assistance package will include several new drone and anti-drone systems the US has not previously made available, as well as equipment to help Ukraine counter Russian electronic warfare. The new drones include the Switchblade 600, a bigger version of the loitering munition (or kamikaze drone) than has already been supplied, as well as the CyberLux K8, Altius-600, and the Jump 20, which can be used for surveillance or adapted to carry bombs. The US will also send more ammunition for the high mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars) and 155mm howitzer guns Washington has provided over the course of the year. The US commerce department will list more than 80 companies from Russia, China and other countries accused of sanctions busting, including “backfill activities in support of Russia’s defence sector”, replenishing material that Moscow has used up in the invasion. The Biden administration has become increasingly vocal about Chinese aid to the Russian war machine, and has raised concerns recently that Beijing is contemplating supplying weapons directly. The companies named would be blocked from purchasing hi-tech items such as semiconductors made in the US, or using US technology abroad. Tariffs will be raised on imports from Russia of more than 100 metals, minerals and chemical products, including aluminium smelt or cast in Russia, worth an estimated $2.8bn (£2.3bn) in revenue to Moscow. Unveiling its latest sanctions, the UK said it was banning the export of every item Russia has been found using on the battlefield to date, a list covering hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components. The British government is also imposing sanctions on senior executives at Russia’s state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, who Ukraine says are complicit in the seizure and forced nationality change of staff at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, and their children. UK sanctions also target 34 top officials from Russia’s two largest defence companies, Rostec and Almaz-Antey, and four banks. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said sanctions were working. “Russia is falling backwards towards an autarkic economy cut away from the world. Our sanctions are eroding sharply its economic base, slashing any prospect to modernise it,” she said in Tallinn, where she attended ceremonies to mark Estonia’s independence day. The EU agreed late on Friday to ban on exports of critical technologies to Russia, as part of a 10th round of sanctions. Despite plans to have the measures in place by the first anniversary of the invasion, the measures were held up by a last-minute dispute over how quickly to ban synthetic rubber imports from Russia. Italy objected to a rapid phase-out, while Poland blindsided other member states with its insistence the trade be stopped as soon as possible. EU diplomats voiced frustration that Poland, one of the bloc’s most hawkish voices on sanctions, was prepared to hold up a deal over a relatively minor issue. Some sources attributed Warsaw’s position to hopes of gaining ground for its domestic rubber industry. “Poland is basically stopping this whole package on 24 February to carve out some putative advantage for the Polish rubber industry,” said one diplomat. Morawiecki had said earlier the package was “too soft, too weak” and called on allies to adopt a tougher position. Poland eventually climbed down on an immediate ban; a Polish diplomat said they accepted a deal on six conditions, including launching work to sanction 150 Russian propagandists and a review clause on rubber imports. Talks between the 27 member states this week also became bogged down over a proposal to fine European companies and individuals if they failed to report on the location of Russian state assets. That idea was dropped as member states said they needed more time to study the idea. The latest EU package will ban the export of components for drones and helicopters, as well as spare parts for vehicles, items that were found on the battlefields of Ukraine and were missed off previous sanctions lists. Western countries are increasingly concerned about Russia’s ability to dodge sanctions by sourcing technology from front companies or friendly exporters in neighbouring countries. EU and UK exports to Armenia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, all members of the Eurasian Customs Union with Russia and Belarus, jumped by between 15% and 90% following the invasion of Ukraine, according to a paper by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development released on Friday. The increase was particularly marked for sanctioned goods no longer available to Russia, and showed “a pattern suggestive of new supply chains”, the authors said. Western officials have also noted with concern the growth in Russian trade with the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and China. Officials are now studying how to prevent sanctions dodging, via a mix of persuasion or threats to cut market access. Meanwhile, the US has this week begun disbursing $9.9bn in financial assistance to help fund healthcare, education and emergency services in Ukraine, while the G7 as a whole has increased its commitment of budget and economic support to $39bn for this year. Part of the US assistance will be a third delivery by the energy department of equipment to help patch the Ukrainian power grid equipment which has been weakened by repeated Russian missile attacks over the course of the year."

                    "headline": "Ben Wallace rules out sending British Typhoon jets to Ukraine in short term ",
                    "bodyText": "Britain is not planning to send RAF Typhoons to Ukraine, the defence secretary has said, rejecting a high profile campaign led by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, with the support of the former prime minister Boris Johnson. Ben Wallace said the jets would be too complex for Ukraine – but added, with the backing of Downing Street, the fighters could provide air cover for eastern bloc countries to backfill if they wanted to send their MiG-29 and other Soviet-era jets to Kyiv. The defence secretary said: “We’re not going to send our own Typhoon jets in the short term to Ukraine,” in an interview with Sky News to coincide with the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion on Friday. But the comments deal a blow to Zelenskiy, who travelled to the UK this month to make a dramatic request for “wings for freedom” in a rare address by a foreign leader to both Houses of Parliament in Westminster. Instead, Wallace said that if other countries with Soviet-origin aircraft wanted to supply Ukraine instead, the UK would be willing to help provide air cover for that country to make up for the loss of jets. Downing Street said it had always believed that western jets “wouldn’t help in the immediate future given the training timelines and support systems required” but added that RAF Typhoons could help other countries. “The PM has previously described our willingness to help support other countries who might be able to offer their capabilities, we could help backfill for example, in a range of things they might be required to do,” a spokesperson added. Poland has repeatedly said it is willing to supply Ukraine with its fleet of 28 MiG-29s “as part of a wider coalition”, although at least some of the jets are thought to have been broken up and supplied to Kyiv’s air force covertly as spare parts. Kyiv has also called for it to be supplied with US-made F-16s, the most widely available fighter jet worldwide, and discussions between the US and Ukraine continue, despite an initial rejection of the plan by Joe Biden, the US president, in late January. Ukrainian pilots will need to be retrained to use any western fighter aircraft – with the process taking anywhere from three months, as some of Kyiv’s pilots say, to six to nine months, as suggested by RAF insiders. Labour said it would support the government on whatever decision it made on fighter jets. The party leader, Keir Starmer, said: “We are not going to politically divide on this. We will support the government in the decision that it makes.” Part of the problem, Wallace added, was that a rapid deployment would have to involve hundreds of British ground crew having to relocate to Ukraine for support – although Ukraine hopes to train its own engineers as needed. “Gifting a fighter jet comes with hundreds of people: engineers, pilots, training, electronic warfare. The more complicated the platform, the greater the tail,” Wallace said, referring to the need for ground support. “The west is not going to be putting troops into Ukraine in those scales. The idea that we would put Typhoons in – we would have to send 200 RAF people and we’re not going to do that … at this current stage,” he added. Aviation experts have questioned whether RAF Typhoons, which traditionally fly from long, clear runways, would be suitable for Ukraine, given its need to operate in rough, dispersed airstrips to prevent planes being shot down by Russia. King Charles offered his support for Ukraine in a personal message issued on Friday. The country’s people, he said, have “suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack” and “shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy”. A minute’s silence was led by Rishi Sunak at 11am outside No 10. Joined by his wife, Akshata Murthy, the prime minister paid his respects to Ukrainians killed in the fighting, along with Kyiv’s ambassador to Britain, Vadym Prystaiko, and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said Ukraine must not be forced into a “Munich agreement-like compromise”, referring to the failed 1938 pre-war agreement that led to the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. The Anglican leader, writing in the Daily Telegraph, also called for a “just peace” between Russia and Ukraine, and a settlement that Moscow could consider fair. “Russia cannot end up like Germany after 1919; it must be able to recover and be secure without being allowed to repeat its aggression,” he added. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, has announced an export ban on any equipment Russia is found to have used on the battlefield. The ban will mean companies cannot supply Russia with a range of items, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components. The Foreign Office also announced new sanctions on executives at several Russian companies, including the state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, two defence companies and four banks. Ukraine’s president thanked Sunak and the British people for “unwavering support” in “the fight against aggression”. Zelenskiy praised the prime minister for the sanctions package, and made no mention of the announcement regarding Typhoons."

                    "bodyText": "Western leaders have largely dismissed a peace plan for Ukraine laid out by China’s government, arguing that Beijing does not have the international credibility to act as a mediator in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. China’s government called for peace talks while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians, in a statement which appeared to maintain Beijing’s stance that the west was fuelling the conflict and which analysts dismissed as anodyne. The 12-point position paper on Ukraine was released on Friday morning, on the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion. The paper, for which Ukraine was not consulted, was cautiously welcomed by Kyiv, but criticised by US officials and some analysts who noted the growing ties between China and Russia. On Wednesday, China’s top diplomat visited Moscow and pledged a deeper partnership. Speaking to reporters on Friday in Tallinn, Estonia’s capital, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said: “China doesn’t have much credibility because they have not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine.” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said China had already “taken sides” in the conflict. The paper stated that the international community should “create conditions and platforms” for negotiations to resume, and claimed that China would continue to “play a constructive role in this regard”.  It did not offer specific steps but included strong language opposing the “threat or use” of nuclear weapons. “Nuclear proliferation must be prevented and nuclear crisis avoided. China opposes the research, development and use of chemical and biological weapons by any country under any circumstances.” The paper did not address its suggestions to a particular side in the conflict, instead calling for all parties to “stay rational and exercise restraint” and to “strictly abide by international humanitarian law, avoid attacking civilians or civilian facilities, protect women, children and other victims of the conflict”. Some of the language appeared to be directed at the west. The paper warned against “expanding military blocs”, an apparent reference to Nato, and urged all parties to “avoid fanning the flames and aggravating tensions”, mirroring language that Beijing officials have repeatedly used to criticise US support of Ukraine. Ukraine’s charge d’affaires to China, Zhanna Leshchynska, called the position paper “a good sign” and said she expected China to be more active in its support of her country. “We hope they also urge Russia to stop the war and withdraw its troops,” she said, adding that she did not at the moment see China as supporting Ukrainian efforts. China’s government has presented itself as a neutral party, one capable of easing tensions between Russia and Ukraine. However, it has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, instead blaming the west for inflaming tensions, and some senior officials have repeatedly voiced explicit support for Russia’s aims. This week the US government said it had intelligence suggesting Beijing was considering supplying weapons to Russia, and on Friday a report by Der Spiegel claimed Moscow was in negotiations with a Chinese company about supplying large quantities of strike drones. On Friday, Beijing also abstained – for the fourth time – from a UN vote demanding Russia withdraw from Ukraine. Chinese officials rejected the US claims as baseless smears and have yet to comment on the Der Spiegel report. Friday’s paper also emphasised positions Beijing has promoted in the past, including a demand for respect of national sovereignty and “territorial integrity”, and for the end of economic sanctions. Speaking to CNN, the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, dismissed much of the paper’s contents. “My first reaction to it is that it could stop at point one, which is to respect the sovereignty of all nations,” he said. “Ukraine wasn’t attacking Russia. Nato wasn’t attacking Russia. The United States wasn’t attacking Russia … Russia’s aims in the war were to wipe Ukraine off the map, to absorb it into Russia.” Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the US-based German Marshall Fund, said the paper was largely a summary of its previously stated positions and statements, which were “replete with contradictions”. “Beijing claims to support Ukraine’s sovereignty, but it has not criticised Russia’s annexations of Ukrainian territory,” Glaser said. Glaser also noted that the last of the 12 points, which stated that China stood ready to help in post-conflict reconstruction, “sounds like China is keen to get its [state-owned enterprises] into Ukraine, both to make a profit and promote Chinese influence via commercial and economic means”. Drew Thompson, a scholar with the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and former US defence department official, said the statement lacked credibility. “Without … specifying the need to return territory that Russia is attempting to annex, Beijing’s statement is not a plan but a statement of anodyne principals that China itself does not follow, such as opposition to economic coercion in cases of political differences,” he said. Niva Yau, a senior researcher at the OSCE Academy in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, said the paper was aimed at an audience who wanted to “stay passive” in the conflict, but could have broader ramifications in Eurasia, particularly former Soviet states that were closely following the humanitarian disaster. China’s “cold and detached” points indicated Beijing was still siding with Russia and would not be a reliable partner to them in the future, she said. Reuters contributed to this report"

                    "bodyText": "Commemorations have been held in Ukraine and around the world on the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, with moments of silence observed, and candlelit vigils and protests held. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, describing the events of 24 February 2022 as “the longest day of our lives”, pledged to push for victory. Striking a tone of grim defiance as he congratulated Ukrainians on their resilience in the face of Europe’s biggest and deadliest conflict since the second world war, in a video address Zelenskiy said Ukrainians had proved themselves to be invincible over “a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity”. Zelenskiy said the military situation in Ukraine’s south is “quite dangerous” in some places, while conditions in the east are “very difficult”. He said pro-Moscow forces had again shelled the southern city of Kherson, this time cutting off heat for 40,000 people. In a further address in Lithuania given via video link, Zelenskiy said Russia had to lose its war in Ukraine to ensure it stopped seeking to conquer territories it once controlled. “Russian revanchism must forever forget about Kyiv and Vilnius, about Chișinău and Warsaw, about our brothers in Latvia and Estonia, in Georgia and every other country that is now threatened,” he said. Russia’s Wagner group of mercenaries has taken full control of the Ukrainian village of Berkhivka, just north-west of Bakhmut, the Wagner founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, claimed on Telegram. The Group of Seven (G7) has announced a range of further economic, military and financial sanctions against Russia. The group announced it would take unprecedented measures in order to weaken Russia, promising measures against its diamond exports. It said third countries that helped Russia evade sanctions would face “severe costs” and it is understood to be setting up an “enforcement coordination mechanism” to stop evasion of G7 sanctions already imposed. The US has announced an additional package of security assistance for Ukraine. In a statement, the Biden administration said it would include “several new unmanned aerial systems (UAS), counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) equipment to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences … and electronic warfare detection equipment to bolster Ukraine’s ability to repel Russia’s aggression”. China has called for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians, in a statement that appeared to maintain Beijing’s stance that the west is fuelling the conflict and was dismissed as anodyne by analysts. The 12-point position paper on Ukraine was released on Friday morning. The paper, for which Ukraine was not consulted, was cautiously welcomed by Kyiv, but criticised by US officials and some analysts who noted the growing ties between China and Russia. On Wednesday, China’s top diplomat visited Moscow and pledged a deeper partnership. China’s call for peace talks “doesn’t have much credibility”, the secretary-general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said, as he warned Beijing against supplying arms to the Kremlin war machine. Stoltenberg told reporters: “China doesn’t have much credibility because they have not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine and they also signed just days before the invasion an agreement between President Xi and President Putin on a limitless partnership with Russia.” President Zelenskiy has welcomed some elements of a Chinese proposal for a ceasefire in Russia’s war on Ukraine. “China has shown its thoughts. I believe that the fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad,” Zelenskiy said. Russia appreciated China’s plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and was open to achieving the goals of what it calls its “special military operation” through political and diplomatic means, the foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. However, this would also mean recognising “new territorital realities” in Ukraine, Zakharova said, referring to Russia’s unilateral annexation of four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - as well as Crimea. The Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, has said any “peace plan” to end the conflict must involve the withdrawal of Russian troops to the borders of 1991. He said a ceasefire that resulted in the continued occupation by Russia of Ukrainian territory “isn’t about peace, but about freezing the war, Ukraine’s defeat, next stages of genocide”. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said on Friday more talks between parliamentary groups were needed before Hungary’s ratification of Finland and Sweden’s Nato membership, which lawmakers will start debating next Wednesday. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, said his country has delivered its first Leopard tanks to Ukraine. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, went to Kyiv on Friday in a show of support for Ukraine, the government spokesperson Piotr Muller wrote on Twitter. Sweden will send up to 10 Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and defence minister, Pål Jonson, said. Canada will provide more than $32m (£19.7m) in support to further strengthen Ukraine’s security and stabilisation, its government has announced. Denmark is “open” to the idea of sending fighter jets to Ukraine to help its war effort, the Danish defence minister said on Friday. Britain is not planning to send RAF Typhoons to Ukraine, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace said. Wallace said the jets would be too complex for Ukraine – but added, with the backing of Downing Street, the fighters could provide air cover for eastern bloc countries to backfill if they wanted to send their MiG-29 and other Soviet-era jets to Kyiv. Wallace also said Britain is taking steps to rebuild its stockpiles of munitions which have been depleted by the war in Ukraine. Britain has imposed an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine, the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, announced . The archbishop of Canterbury said an end to the war in Ukraine cannot lead to Russia being treated like Germany after the first world war. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said the only way for Moscow to eventually ensure a lasting peace with Ukraine was to push back its own borders as far as possible, “even if these are the borders of Poland”. Some US and western officials estimate Russia’s military casualties at nearly 200,000 dead or wounded. Battlefield losses are impossible to verify independently, but soldiers fighting on the frontline and military officials have conceded that the death toll has spiked in recent weeks. Thousands of civilians have been killed and Ukrainian prosecutors have reported thousands of allegations of war crimes. On Thursday, the UN general assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution to demand Moscow withdraw its troops from Ukraine. There were 141 votes in favour and 32 abstentions on Thursday night. China abstained on the vote and six countries joined Russia to vote no – Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua and Syria. A US army official has said it could take up to two years for M1 Abrams tanks to be delivered to Ukraine. The US announced in January that it would supply Ukraine with 31 advanced M1 Abrams tanks worth $400m in a matter of months. But plans were still being drawn up on how and when they would be delivered, the US army secretary, Christine Wormuth, said. Russia’s foreign ministry has warned that any actions threatening its troops in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria would be seen as a direct attack on Russia and trigger an “adequate response”. Moldova has dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry that Ukraine planned to invade Transnistria after staging a false-flag operation, and called for calm. The Russian ministry said Ukraine planned to stage an attack purportedly by Russian forces from Transnistria as a pretext for the invasion, state media reported. The EU is expected to announce a ban on €11bn (£9.7bn) worth of exports of critical technologies to Russia, as part of a 10th round of sanctions. Despite plans to have the measures in place by the first anniversary of the invasion, the latest measures were being held up by a last-minute dispute over how quickly to ban synthetic rubber imports from Russia. Italy objected to a rapid phase-out, while Poland blindsided other member states with its insistence the trade be stopped as soon as possible."

                    "bodyText": "Barely a day goes by without some new story about AI, or artificial intelligence. The excitement about it is palpable – the possibilities, some say, are endless. Fears about it are spreading fast, too. There can be much assumed knowledge and understanding about AI, which can be bewildering for people who have not followed every twist and turn of the debate. So, the Guardian’s technology editors, Dan Milmo and Alex Hern, are going back to basics – answering the questions that millions of readers may have been too afraid to ask. What is artificial intelligence? The term is almost as old as electronic computers themselves, coined back in 1955 by a team including legendary Harvard computer scientist Marvin Minsky. In some respects, it is already in our lives in ways you may not realise. The special effects in some films and voice assistants like Amazon’s Alexa all use simple forms of artificial intelligence. But in the current debate, AI has come to mean something else. It boils down to this: most old-school computers do what they are told. They follow instructions given to them in the form of code. But if we want computers to solve more complex tasks, they need to do more than that. To be smarter, we are trying to train them how to learn in a way that imitates human behaviour. Computers cannot be taught to think for themselves, but they can be taught how to analyse information and draw inferences from patterns within datasets. And the more you give them – computer systems can now cope with truly vast amounts of information – the better they should get at it. The most successful versions of machine learning in recent years have used a system known as a neural network, which is modelled at a very simple level on how we think a brain works. What are the different types of artificial intelligence? With no strict definition of the phrase, and the lure of billions of dollars of funding for anyone who sprinkles AI into pitch documents, almost anything more complex than a calculator has been called artificial intelligence by someone. There is no easy categorisation of artificial intelligence and the field is growing so quickly that even at the cutting edge, new approaches are being uncovered every month. Here are some of the main ones you may hear about: Reinforcement learning Perhaps the most basic form of training there is, reinforcement learning involves giving feedback each time the system performs a task, so that it learns from doing things correctly. It can be a slow and expensive process, but for systems that interact with the real world, there is sometimes no better way. Large-language models This is one of the so-called neural networks. Large-language models are trained by pouring into them billions of words of everyday text, gathered from sources ranging from books to tweets and everything in between. The LLMs draw on all this material to predict words and sentences in certain sequences. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) This is a way of pairing two neural networks together to make something new. The networks are used in creative work in music, visual art or film-making. One network is given the role of creator while a second is given the role of marker, and the first learns to create things that the second will approve of. Symbolic AI There are even AI techniques that look to the past for inspiration. Symbolic AI is an approach that rejects the idea that a simple neural network is the best option, and tries to mix machine learning with more diligently structured facts about the world. What is a chatbot? A chatbot draws on the AI we have just been looking at with the large-language models. A chatbot is trained on a vast amount of information culled from the internet. It responds to text prompts with conversational-style responses. The most famous example is ChatGPT. It has been developed by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based company backed by Microsoft. Launched as a simple website in November last year, it rapidly became a sensation, reaching more than 100 million users within two months. The chatbot gives plausible-sounding – if sometimes inaccurate – answers to questions. It can also write poems, summarise lengthy documents and, to the alarm of teachers, draft essays. Tell me more about how these chatbots work The latest generation of chatbots, like ChatGPT, draw on astronomical amounts of material – pretty much the entire written output of humanity, or as much of it as their owners can acquire. Those systems then try to answer a deceptively simple question: given a piece of text, what comes next? If the input is: “To be or not to be”, the output is very likely to be: “that is the question”; if it is: “The highest mountain in the world is” the next words will probably be: “Mount Everest”. But the AI can also be more creative: if the input is a paragraph of vaguely Dickensian prose, then the chatbot will continue in the same way, with the model writing its own ersatz short story in the style of the prompt. Or, if the input is a series of questions about the nature of intelligence, the output is likely to draw from science fiction novels. Why do chatbots make errors? LLMs do not understand things in a conventional sense – and they are only as good, or as accurate, as the information with which they are provided. They are essentially machines for matching patterns . Whether the output is “true” is not the point, so long as it matches the pattern. If you ask a chatbot to write a biography of a moderately famous person, it may get some facts right, but then invent other details that sound like they should fit in biographies of that sort of person. And it can be wrongfooted: ask ChatGPT whether one pound of feathers weighs more than two pounds of steel, it will focus on the fact that the question looks like the classic trick question. It will not notice that the numbers have been changed. Google’s rival to ChatGPT, called Bard, had an embarrassing debut this month when a video demo of the chatbot showed it giving the wrong answer to a question about the James Webb space telescope. Which brings us to growing concern about the amount of misinformation online – and how AI is being used to generate it. What is deepfake? Deepfake is the term for a sophisticated hoax that that uses AI to create phoney images, particularly of people. There are some noticeable amateurish examples, such as a fake Volodymyr Zelenskiy calling on his soldiers to lay down their weapons last year, but there are eerily plausible ones, too. In 2021 a TikTok account called DeepTomCruise posted clips of a faux Tom Cruise playing golf and pratfalling around his house, created by AI. ITV has released a sketch show comprised of celebrity deepfakes, including Stormzy and Harry Kane, called Deep Fake Neighbour Wars. In the audio world, a startup called ElevenLabs admitted its voice-creation platform had been used for “voice cloning misuse cases” This followed a report that it had been used to create deepfake audio versions of Emma Watson and Joe Rogan spouting abuse and other unacceptable material. Experts fear a wave of disinformation and scams as the technology becomes more widely available. Potential frauds include personalised phishing emails – which attempt to trick users into handing over data such as login details – produced at mass scale, and impersonations of friends or relatives. “I strongly suspect there will soon be a deluge of deepfake videos, images, and audio, and unfortunately many of them will be in the context of scams,” says Noah Giansiracusa, an assistant professor of mathematical sciences at Bentley University in the US. Can AI pose a threat to human life and social stability? The dystopian fears about AI are usually represented by a clip from The Terminator, the Arnold Schwarzenegger film starring a near-indestructible AI-robot villain. Clips on social media of the latest machinations from Boston Dynamics, a US-based robotics company, are often accompanied by jokey comments about a looming machine takeover. Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, has described the danger from AI as “much greater than the danger of nuclear warheads”, while Bill Gates has raised concerns about AI’s role in weapons systems. The Future of Life Institute, an organisation researching existential threats to humanity, has warned of the potential for AI-powered swarms of killer drones, for instance. More prosaically, there are also concerns that unseen glitches in AI systems will lead to unforeseen crises in, for instance, financial trading. As a result of these fears, there are calls for a regulatory framework for AI, which is supported even by arch libertarians like Musk, whose main concern is not “short-term stuff” like improved weaponry but “digital super-intelligence”. Kai-Fu Lee, a former president of Google China and AI expert, told the Guardian that governments should take note of concerns among AI professionals about the military implications. He said: “Just as chemists spoke up about chemical weapons and biologists about biological weapons, I hope governments will start listening to AI scientists. It’s probably impossible to stop it altogether. But there should be some ways to at least reduce or minimise the most egregious uses.” Will AI take our jobs? In the short term, some experts believe AI will enhance jobs rather than take them, although even now there are obvious impacts: an app called Otter has made transcription a difficult profession to sustain; Google Translate makes basic translation available to all. According to a study published this week, AI could slash the amount of time people spend on household chores and caring, with robots able to perform about 39% of domestic tasks within a decade. For now the impact will be incremental, although it is clear white collar jobs will be affected in the future. Allen &amp; Overy, a leading UK law firm, is looking at integrating tools built on GPT into its operations, while publishers including BuzzFeed and the Daily Mirror owner Reach are looking to use the technology, too. “AI is certainly going to take some jobs, in just the same way that automation took jobs in factories in the late 1970s,” says Michael Wooldridge, a professor of computer science at the University of Oxford. “But for most people, I think AI is just going to be another tool that they use in their working lives, in the same way they use web browsers, word processors and email. In many cases they won’t even realise they are using AI – it will be there in the background, working behind the scenes.” If I want to try examples of AI for myself, where should I look? Microsoft’s Bing Chat and OpenAI’s ChatGPT are the two most advanced free chatbots on the market, but both are being overwhelmed by the weight of interest: Bing Chat has a long waitlist, which users can sign up for through the company’s app on iOS and Android, while ChatGPT is occasionally offline for non-paying users. To experiment with image generation, OpenAI’s Dall-E 2 is free for a small number of images a month, while more advanced users can join the Midjourney beta through the chat app Discord. Or you can use the wide array of apps already on your phone that invisibly use AI, from the translate apps built in to iOS and Android, through the search features in Google and Apple’s Photos apps, to the “computational photography” tools, which use neural network-based image processing to touch up photos as they are taken."

Here are some of the key things we learned today, Friday 24 February: • The Ukrainian ambassador Vasyl Myroshnychenko has given an address to the National Press Club on the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He’s called for continual support in myriad ways from the Australian government and Ukraine’s allies. • The prime minister, Anthony Albanese pledged a further $33m in military aid to the war-stricken nation. • The prime minister has also thrown his support behind the NSW Labor leader, Chris Minns, saying NSW needs a change of government, as Perrottet’s Liberal state government is “too busy fighting each other, to fight for the people of New South Wales”. • The Queensland government has announced a GPS tracker trial for children in Toowoomba, a week after residents vented their frustrations at a youth crime forum in the city. • Papua New Guinea’s foreign minister has confirmed the release of one hostage but says he “cannot guarantee” the safety of at least three others, including an Australian-New Zealand archaeologist, held in the southern highlands. • The Australian Education Union is the latest organisation to back the yes campaign in the voice to parliament referendum, saying its membership of school teachers overwhelmingly back the change and will work to support the movement. • A hive of foreign spies busted by Australia’s intelligence agency in the past year was reportedly linked to Russia. That’s all for this Friday. Look after yourselves this weekend! Evidence contradicts claims of key robodebt witness A key witness at the robodebt royal commission has been shown evidence contradicting his claims he didn’t know the unlawful “income averaging” method was being used by Centrelink, the inquiry heard. The commission is investigating why the Coalition program used so-called “income averaging” to raise hundreds of thousands of Centrelink debts between 2015 and 2019 despite Department of Social Services (DSS) lawyers warning it would be unlawful. Mark Withnell, former general manager of business integrity at Department of Human Services (DHS), told the commission on Friday he couldn’t explain emails and other documents he’d seen referring to the use of income averaging in the program. Withnell was asked about his involvement in the 2015 budget process that saw the robodebt proposal adopted, saying he told his boss, deputy secretary Malisa Golightly, income averaging could not be used due to DSS’s concerns. Withnell told the commission he believed there had been “agreement” to proceed with the plan without income averaging being used. Read the full story here: There were 3,052 Covid-19 cases reported in Victoria this week, with 33 Covid-related deaths reported to the Department of Health and Human Services this week. There are 94 Covid patients in Victorian hospitals, with four in intensive care. Two people are on a ventilator. Cummins to miss third Test in India due to ill mother The Australia captain, Pat Cummins will remain in Sydney and miss the third Test against India to be with his seriously ill mother, AAP reports. Cummins flew home to Australia on Sunday night, immediately after the team’s second Test defeat to India in Delhi, to be around his family. The 29-year-old on Thursday night informed coach Andrew McDonald of his decision to remain in Australia, with the rest of the squad told at training on Friday morning. Cummins said: I have decided against returning to India at this time as my mother is ill and in palliative care. I feel I am best being here with my family. I appreciate the overwhelming support I have received from Cricket Australia and my teammates. Thanks for your understanding. Cummins intends to be available for the fourth and final Test in Ahmedabad, but it is possible he will sit out the rest of the series. The star fast bowler was expected to return to India on Friday ahead of the third Test in Indore, starting on 1 March. Steve Smith will now fill in as skipper. It will be the third time Smith has stepped in as Test captain since Cummins became skipper in November 2021. Cummins has been forced to sit out the two most recent pink-ball matches in Adelaide against England and the West Indies due to Covid-19 and injury. The New South Wales Environmental Protection Agency has been made aware of dark brown to black material in the waters off Wollongong and Shellharbour beaches. They say they believe the material is “naturally occurring and not a pollution incident” but they are investigating, and recommend people avoid swimming in it. Government expects Qantas to lower airfares after reporting bumper profit The transport minister, Catherine King, has told Australian airlines she expects them to lower airfares in light of the bumper profit announced by Qantas and other carriers. On Thursday, Qantas delivered an out-of-the-ordinary $1.43bn underlying net profit in the six months to December that was higher than the profit it recorded in a 12-month period leading up to the pandemic. Its chief executive, Alan Joyce, defended stubbornly high airfares as linked to industry-wide shortages and issues that have stopped airlines from running as many services, despite demand nearing pre-pandemic levels. Appearing on ABC TV on Friday afternoon, King was asked if she thought Qantas was turning a profit by limiting its capacity. King said it was “unbelievably fantastic to see the demand has come back and come back so strongly”, and noted capacity constraints were not limited just to Qantas. However she delivered a blunt message that the public would now expect more from the airline given its strong recovery. King said: I think the customer experience particularly, to be blunt, on Qantas, has been fairly poor. I think even the CEO would recognise that they’ve had some real challenges in terms of the timeliness of their service plus also the customer experience, and I’m hearing that loud and clear. You only have to be on Twitter for a few minutes, as aviation minister, to see that and so I think that’s important that you know, that feedback is given very clearly to Qantas there’s an expectation to improve that, but also prices are going to need to come down. King said she thought some customers were “paying an exorbitant amount, frankly, for some of the air fares that are happening both domestically and internationally”: I think many people would have some expectation that some of the profits that these companies are making are returned and returned in customer service and in cheaper airfares … I think people are making that loudly and clearly known to me and I’m pretty sure Qantas has heard that message as well. Australians thanked for not succumbing to ‘Ukraine fatigue’ The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations has released a statement today, on the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion. It’s quite long but here’s the crux of it: As we go into the second year of this full-scale brutal war against Ukraine, we will continue to work with Federal and State Governments to provide assistance to the displaced Ukrainians who have made Australia home, at least temporarily. We will continue to support Ukraine through our fundraising — over $8 million has already been raised through the UCA, and has helped us to build shelters in Irpin and Bucha for displaced people in Ukraine, and send food and medical supplies to the front line. We will continue to raise funds for displaced Ukrainians in Australia via our UCA Resettlement Fund. And we will always be grateful to the Australian Government for the humanitarian and military aid it has provided — and that it has re-committed today to assist Ukraine ‘for as long as it takes’. But most importantly, we want to thank the Australian people for their support. For not succumbing to ‘Ukraine fatigue’. For understanding that what has happened to Ukraine is unfair and unjust. For standing up for democracy and a strong international order. And for recognising that Ukraine’s success is essential not just for Ukraine, but also for Australia and for peace, security and stability globally. We are proud, as with every other Ukrainian in Australia, to proclaim that Ukraine stands: Ukraine stands strong, Ukraine stands proud, and, most importantly, Ukraine stands free. Melbourne motorists take note We’re heading into peak hour in eastern Australia, and Melbourne residents on the move should note that all outbound lanes of the Monash Freeway are currently stopped due to a serious collision between Eastlink and Stud Road. Motorists are being advised to avoid the freeway entirely if they’re heading towards Dandenong. Time needed to fix teaching shortage ‘crisis’, minister says The education minister says a whole of sector approach will be required to fix the teaching shortage “crisis”, acknowledging while the sector wants him to go “harder and faster” it will take time to address the gaps. Speaking at the Australian Education Union federal conference in Melbourne on Friday, Jason Clare said he wouldn’t be a minister who called teachers “duds” or bagged the profession, promising to address teaching shortages as a priority. It’s not the same job it was just a few years ago. It’s harder. Part of that’s Covid. You see better than anyone the mental health impact that still lingers long after the lockdowns. But it’s not just Covid. Part of it is there are fewer friends now in the staffroom to help bear the load. Not enough young people want to be teachers any more, and more and more experienced teachers are leaving. I know that’s not new. It’s been building for a decade. But now it’s at crisis point. That’s the truth. Clare said he would engage with ministers, teachers, principals, unions and other stakeholders to consult on ideas for future reform as a priority. A few weeks ago a report came out from the Productivity Commission on the current National School Reform Agreement. It was blistering in its criticism. It said it doesn’t have any real targets or practical reforms to fix the sorts of things we need to fix. The next one will. That’s what the job of the team I announce in the next few weeks will be. To advise me and other education ministers on the things that future funding should be tied to ... and that means talking to you. Listening to you. Working with you. I know you want me to go harder and faster than I am. And I get it. I really do. But this is the last best chance to get this right. The Queensland government has announced a GPS tracker trial for children in Toowoomba, a week after residents vented their frustrations at a youth crime forum in the city. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, did not appear at the forum last Wednesday but spent Friday morning meeting with victims of crime across the “Garden City”. At the city’s police headquarters, Palaszczuk told reporters a trial of electronic monitoring devices will be expanded to Toowoomba and will apply to offenders 15 years and older. High-visibility police patrols will also become a permanent feature of policing in the region, and a police flying squad will be expanded into the city. GPS trackers were first trialled for offenders 16 years and over in 2021 in Townsville, North Brisbane, Moreton, Logan and the Gold Coast. In deciding whether to impose a tracking device, courts were required to obtain a ‘suitability assessment’ from the department, including whether the child had access to a mobile phone, a power source to keep it charged, and the ability to understand compliance conditions. Criminologist and the Leneen Forde chair of child and family research at Griffith university, Silke Meyer, said the previous trial had shown the wrong cohort had been targeted: They used them on low-risk offenders with stable housing. As a result the evidence might look good but we actually know nothing about whether it works for [serious repeat offenders who are often in the state’s care]. Meyer said unless the trial comes with wraparound support, it will only “set [children] up to fail and criminalise them for non-compliance.” When asked what evidence there was to back such a trial, Palaszczuk said it had worked for adults: It’s up to the magistrates to make that order for the government. So we will give the judiciary the power to set the rules as they see fit. But what these laws are doing is aimed at those repeat offenders. Matt Kean disrupts harmony at energy ministers meeting Something else on energy ministers’ to-do list, it seems, is the Commonwealth ponying up money promised to New South Wales in relation to energy rebates. Disturbing the harmony a bit at the energy ministers’ media conference was NSW’s energy minister (and treasurer), Matt Kean, again giving his federal counterparts a bit of a serve. The tiff involves a promise by the Albanese government that it would provide Queensland and NSW compensation for some of the effects of putting a $125/tonne price cap on black coal as part of the package to lower power prices. Kean said the feds haven’t matched the energy rebates of the NSW government – a sensitive issue going into a state election in four weeks’ time: What we haven’t seen yet is a single cent from the Commonwealth in energy rebates for New South Wales or the other states and territories. Now, I’m sick of the excuse that we’re waiting for [treasurer] Jim Chalmers’ budget to see that energy bill relief that citizens right across the nation are waiting for now. And to sink the proverbial slipper in a bit deeper, Kean also touched on another sensitive issue this week – possible changes by federal Labor to super: We saw a federal Labor promise when it comes to superannuation. I hope it’s not going to be like that. We’re expecting energy bill rebates for NSW families and right now we haven’t seen a single cent. We’ve approached Chalmers’ office. The issue, as we recall from the last time this surfaced, was that NSW won’t start divvying out the dough until 1 July but the point is they need to line up the funds well before that. Perhaps even before caretaker provisions kick in soon. Is that timing playing a role? Final word from the energy ministers meeting The climate and energy minister, Chris Bowen, when wrapping up today’s meeting of energy ministers, touched on those agreements to deal with grid energy congestion mentioned in our earlier post and article, describing them as “a complicated policy matter ... but a very important one”. In short, the renewable energy industry knew they had a problem with worsening congestion as new solar and wind farms came online, but objected to pricing that could suddenly have added to their costs. Instead, they’ll be able to sign up to a voluntary mechanism - or not. Anyway, the industry response to the scrapped locational marginal pricing model has been positive: The Clean Energy Investor Group (CEIG) also welcomed the “decisive actions on reforms to address grid congestion”. Simon Corbell, CEO of the CEIG, said: This is a clear signal to investors that energy ministers are listening to industry and are focused on accelerating the decarbonisation of Australia’s energy system. Bowen said the ministers have asked market authorities and officials to work on the alternative approaches to dealing with congestion, with those efforts to be presented at their next gathering. This is a big step forward. Today, ministers took it out of the too-hard basket and put it on the to-do list. Victorian parliament to examine duck hunting The Victorian government has announced a parliamentary inquiry into the future of duck hunting while allowing this year’s season to go ahead with restrictions in place. The Game Management Authority on Friday confirmed the season will begin on 26 April and end on 30 May, with a bag limit for four birds per day. This is about a month shorter than the average season, which runs from the beginning of the third week of March until the second week of June. As with last year’s season, hunters will be prohibited from shooting both the blue-winged shoveler and hardhead ducks, given both were recently listed as threatened due to declining populations. The minister for outdoor recreation, Sonya Kilkenny, issued a media release coinciding with the announcement of the season, confirming the government will establish a legislative council select committee to examine recreational native bird hunting in Victoria. Here’s her statement: Over the past number of years, the issue of recreational native bird hunting in Victoria has become increasingly contested. Given deeply held views on the subject, the Andrews Labor Government will move to establish a Legislative Council Select Committee to examine recreational native bird hunting in Victoria. The committee will have wide-ranging terms of reference, including the operation of the annual recreational native bird hunting seasons, arrangements in other Australian jurisdictions, their environmental sustainability and impact on amenity, and their social and economic impact. The committee will hold public hearings to hear from hunting associations, animal welfare groups, and regional communities. The motion to establish the committee will be moved by the Government in the Legislative Council during the next sitting week, and subject to its passage, a final report will be due to be tabled by 31 August 2023. Sticking with Victoria briefly, the Environmental Protection Authority Victoria has released its beach report for today and tomorrow. If you want to go swimming in clear water, it sounds like tonight is your best bet. The Victorian government has announced a parliamentary inquiry into the future of duck hunting. Our reporter in Melbourne, Benita Kolovos, will have more on this shortly. Thank you Natasha for all your work so far today! All right team, let’s get on with the rest of the week’s news, shall we? Thanks for your attention this Friday. I’ll leave you with Stephanie Convery now! There were 525 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and no people are in intensive care. There were 1,777 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and two people are in intensive care. Minns to put ‘politics second’ and the interests of the people of NSW first Circling back to the press conference where the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, appeared alongside the NSW Labor leader, Chris Minns, at Callala Bay to make an announcement about improving local road infrastructure. Minns also echoed the federal leader’s words that Labor offers the people of NSW a more united front compared to the Coalition and drew on the federal government putting “urgent needs” before politics. I think that there’s a real opportunity with the prime minister’s appearance on the campaign trail today and earlier this morning to point out that there’s wonderful opportunities in New South Wales if the state and the Commonwealth can work together on the issues affecting the people of New South Wales. We’ve seen in the last nine months of the Labor government in Canberra that the adults are genuinely in charge that politics is taking a backseat to the urgent needs affecting the economy and the community in Australia. And it’s that kind of theory of governing that we want to bring to New South Wales. I lead a united and discipline team that’s putting politics second and the interests of the people of New South Wales first, and I think you’re seeing that in spades at the federal level. It’s wonderful to be here with Anthony and my candidates. Thank you. Covid cases rise as mandatory reporting ends National Covid-19 cases have risen slightly in the final week before mandatory reporting of positive cases comes to an end in Australia, AAP reports. The ACT government on Thursday confirmed it would remove its requirement for residents to disclose Covid-19 infection. From Tuesday, people living in Canberra will no longer have to report their positive test to ACT Health, although they are still strongly encouraged to do so. The ACT is the final state or territory to remove mandatory reporting. It comes as the latest federal health department data shows a slight increase in average daily Covid-19 infections. The national average rose to 2,618 daily cases in the week today, up by 1.2% on the previous week. The largest jump in cases was in Tasmania, where the daily average rose by 34.3%. That was followed by the ACT, where there was a 8.3% jump. Victoria and Queensland were the only jurisdictions to record a decline in infections, dropping 8.7 % and 4.2% respectively. Ministers settle on efforts to ease renewables grid congestion As we foreshadowed earlier today, energy ministers from around Australia meeting in the Hunter Valley have agreed to a number of measures aimed at easing congestion on the grid that means some output from solar and wind farms is being “curtailed”, or wasted. In a communique from the gathering (which also included climate ministers) just posted, ministers “agreed a way forward on the complex issue of transmission access reform”. This includes an agreement to immediately implement ‘enhanced information’ reforms to provide east-coast market participants with better information on the optimal location for new generation and storage, the statement says. More transparency will help investors. Separately, ministers also asked the Energy Security Board (ESB) to work with senior officials and stakeholders to develop a voluntary Congestion Relief Market (CRM) and the priority access model. A detailed design will be provided by mid-2023. “Ministers decided not to further develop or consider the congestion management model and congestion fee options, ruling out any models using locational marginal pricing,” the communique says, dealing with an issue that the industry did not at all want. The ministers say improving access to the grid, if the measures are approved later this year, will “yield net benefits for industry and consumers of up to $5bn and lower emissions by 23m tonnes of CO2 by 2050. And on an issue pressed by Queensland, the Commonwealth will lead jurisdictions in a Review of the National Hydrogen Strategy to “ensure the national strategy positions Australia on a path to be a global hydrogen leader by 2030 on both an export basis and for the decarbonisation of Australian industries”. This strategy is in part a response to the huge US spending in this sector by the Biden administration with its Inflation Reduction Act. We looked at the risks this act had on Australia’s ambitions in this piece: The joint gathering, by the way, is dubbed the Energy and Climate Change Ministerial Council (ECMC), and its second meeting is set for May in the Northern Territory. Albanese is saying he believes NSW needs a change because the Perrottet government is “too busy fighting each other, to fight for the people of New South Wales”. I do get on well with Dominic Perrottet, I get on well with Jeremy Rockliffe, I get on well with every state premier and chief minister. I’ve got to say when we sit around the cabinet table and the dinners beforehand, the environment is collegiate and we work constructively. But the problem for Dominique Perrottet – he leads a rabble that is disunited, that’s too busy fighting each other to fight for the people of New South Wales. And that stands in stark contrast with Chris Minns and his team, including Caitlin and Liza, who are with us here this afternoon. That’s the big difference in order to actually take the state forward, you’ve actually got to have a constructive plan. I find it extraordinary that Mr Perrottet is going to an election with a whole lot of ministers who aren’t re-contesting their seats, because to replace them would cause the sort of chaos that we’ve seen over replacing a single member in the New South Wales Opera House in the last week, let alone the division and fights which are there between the Liberals and the Nationals. So I think that it’s time for a change in New South Wales. it’s time for a government that is united where the premier and the leader can speak on behalf of the government, without having to watch the back, the whole time. Albanese joins Minns’ election campaign in NSW The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has stepped up to speak again on the south coast as he campaigns with the NSW Labor leader, Chris Minns, ahead of the state election. Albanese says he’s heartened by the welcome he’s received from locals on the state’s south coast. It’s been a big day. But every day is a big day. When you’re determined to make a difference to my government is determined to make a difference each and every day. And that’s one of the reasons why I want the bloke who’s going to speak next, Chris Minns, to be elected premier of New South Wales, because I know also that he’s determined to make a difference. Each and every day, to be constructive to be positive. And he’s run a positive campaign as opposition leader. He also shares his praise for Minns, for getting through the difficulty of being a leader of the opposition during the pandemic. It’s something Albanese spoke to our political editor Katharine Murphy about in her Quarterly essay profile on the PM. He likened the experience of being an opposition leader during Covid-19 to needing to duck dive under a massive wave because he knew it wasn’t a time to play politics and raise his own profile when lives were in danger. Today he says Minns experienced something similar: He’s been incredibly positive, including during the pandemic. And I know that it’s difficult to be an opposition leader during the pandemic. You had to put the national interest are in Chris’s case, the interests of New South Wales first, before politics and before raising profile and those issues. But Chris did the right thing by the people of New South Wales. He’s now running a very positive campaign and I look forward to work with him. Ukrainian ambassador’s address wraps The press club address from the ambassador has wrapped up now. But Australian leaders continue to express their solidarity with the Ukraine. Independent MP Allegra Spender shared the demonstration that’s taken place, painting the Ukrainian flag on the street outside the Russian embassy in London. Ukrainian ambassador speaks on China A bit of deliberation about Moldova and whether Russia has any likelihood of succeeding strategically there. Then there’s a question about China, and whether it’s good or bad that Chinese leaders might meet with Russian leaders. Myroshnychenko: Depends on how you look at this, right. On one hand, we urged China to… convince [Putin] to pull out of Ukraine. If that is used for that purpose, I think it is good. If that meeting is used to come up with a plan, how to supply Russia with weapons, I think it is bad. Reporter: “But are you worried of the way in which China has purchased Russian oil, has given Russia some support so far?” Myroshnychenko: Absolutely. China is using that situation for their benefit in many different ways, but, look, China is an important trading partner [for] Ukraine. In fact, it was the largest trading partner for Ukraine before the war started … China also has invested in some infrastructure in Ukraine. Ukraine is part of this initiative with China to Europe, so we believe it is not in the interests of China for this war to end and President Zelenskyy has been calling for a meeting or a call with the leader of China to discuss it. It hasn’t happened yet. We see the developments, we see what is happening now with the top Chinese diplomat, and the good thing as he had a meeting with the foreign minister on the sidelines at the security conference, so there is dialogue out there. Look, it is a bit complicated of course, but this is what it is, this is where we are. Ambassador: ‘Russia must be deterred from using nuclear weapons against Ukraine’ On the matter of an actual roadmap to victory: the journalist says that regardless of the attack strategy, Ukraine still runs the risk of nuclear weapons being used against it. “How is it that you can actually come up with a theory that gives you victory, which means you have got to change something in Putin’s mind?” The ambassador’s answer is not very clear on specifics here, except that he sees it as a global responsibility. He mentions that Ukraine gave up huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons in 1994 on the assurances of Russia, Britain and the US that their sovereignty and security would be intact. He says: The nuclear treaty entails a country that has nuclear weapons cannot threaten a country which has not. This is what is happening. … Russia must be deterred from further aggression. Russia must be deterred from its territorial ambitions and illegal annexation of grand sovereign territory. They must deterred from using infrastructure for war. Russia must be deterred from using nuclear weapons against Ukraine. The only way we can guarantee that, this is when we demonstrate resolve, because if we don’t, what is the reputation of the United Nations? The UN Charter is ignored. What is the credibility of the permanent member for the UN? It is gone if we allow Russia to do what they have done and to stay there in any way. So I think it is not a question for Ukraine. It is more of a question to collective security in the world to be restored. How can we change his mind? I don’t know. I think it can be changed. When he is gone. Ambassador: Putin is banking on war fatigue, but we cannot afford to compromise There are a few questions on media-related matters, including press freedom. I think one of the more interesting questions relates to “Ukraine fatigue” – that is, people becoming tired of the war as an issue. The question is: do you have any concern that as the war goes on, whether Ukraine fatigue will become a bigger issue and will actually undermine some of that support from around the world? Myroshnychenko: I think this is what Putin is banking on, for the world to get tired of the war, the fatigue, let us just stop it. … I can understand that ask for peace. What is important is that we get this ask for justice. In this particular case, justice is very important. We can’t leave those crimes, crimes against humanity, war crimes, crimes of aggression, it cannot be left unpunished, and that is very important. And every time I get that question again: when is going to end? What can we do? Why don’t you start negotiating? This is just... something we’re not ready … I get this question, but I said, look, you get somebody who breaks into your house, rapes your wife, takes your best room and says I will not kill you but I will live here, rape your wife and live here, and that is the compromise. We cannot afford it, that is the situation now. Ukraine needs financial assistance above more soldiers: ambassador The next question concerns resources: the pool of trained professional defence personnel in Ukraine is waning compared to Russia; what does that mean for Ukraine heading into this next year? Will you be looking for more fighters from countries - coming from afar to help bolster the numbers to continue the war? The ambassador responds: We don’t need [boots] on the ground. We appreciate the training that is provided by the Australian Defence Forces to the Ukrainian soldiers … The conscription is on a regular basis, Ukraine is a country of 44 million people so we still have resources and many people who are volunteers, who are joining voluntarily. We need the training and the armour and the weapons and equipment so they are able to use it to defend the country. Ukraine is needing financial assistance to survive. And speaking of that instance, Norway has recently announced a multiyear man of €7.5bn for the next 3-5 years of assistance. The Japanese government [has] committed $5.5bn for the next five years. Within that systematic approach of how we can deal with that, how we can help, and of course it is important to acknowledge the support of the EU. The EU has contributed collectively €67bn in assistance. That support is coming from [the] British, American[s and] Canadian[s]. It must be sustained. In that respect, I hope it will happen. Ukraine asking for continued, sustained and systemic support from Australia There’s some back and forth – including a couple of gags – about Bushmasters. Myroshnychenko is asked: how many would you like? The ambassador responds that it’s not about the numbers; “what is important now is … let’s sit down and let’s talk about the plan”. A follow-up question focuses on whether Bushmasters are really what’s needed at this point. Is artillery or ammunition more useful at this point? Again, the ambassador says it’s not about something specific, although material assistance is welcomes and helpful. Myroshnychenko: What is important is that support is continued, it’s sustained, and systematic. That’s the ask of the Ukrainian government. Ukrainian ambassador would welcome more humanitarian visas On to questions now. The ambassador is asked about the humanitarian visas Australia has provided for displaced people from Ukraine. Reporter: “Given how protracted this war is becoming, would you like to see this program become more generous and then see more Ukrainians come to Australia?” Myroshnychenko: Look, we welcome the humanitarian assistance which was provided by Australia so far … Taking the opportunity, I would like to thank the Australian defence force as well for assistance with shipping some of that humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, primarily provided to displaced people, provided to the refugees. We have according to the statistics only about 6,000 people, Ukrainians, who made it here to Australia. We have about 5 million who are now in Europe, scattered around. We have 1.5 million in Poland, almost 1 million in Germany, 100,000 in the UK, they’re all over Europe. And of course, if more people, Ukrainians could come here as temporary state protection, that would be good. And I think that would be a good thing to do. Opportunities will abound after Ukrainian victory, ambassador says Myroshnychenko wraps up his address (we’ll bring you his answers to questions shortly) with a reflection on the possible length of the war: I’m often asked how long this war will last. But the question of how long is less important than the question that how Ukraine’s victory can be secured. The answer to that is the more Ukraine can continue to work with its allies, the more we can tap into Aussie mateship, the faster we’ll achieve victory for Ukraine and for democracy. He shouts out to the mining magnate Andrew Forrest and his wife Nicola, who he says “have helped Ukraine on a number of occasions already”: They committed money for the Ukrainian farmers, they also recently dispatched 100 power generators to Ukraine, and most importantly, they made a commitment of half a billion US [dollars] for a big reconstruction of … Ukraine’s structure and communications. I hear more and more Australian entrepreneurs are keen to look at those opportunities. We have to think about a positive picture, we need to see what’s at the end of that tunnel. There’s a light there, and once we win, those opportunities will be abound. The pitch here is very strongly: help Ukraine win, and there will be business opportunities to follow. He goes on to outline “six key features” that Ukraine is pursuing in the “road to victory.” Now some wish to ask the question: how does this end … Ukraine is crystal clear about our future. Our road to victory will have six key features that I wish to communicated to you. Number one, we’ll fight for as long as it takes. In the face of the enemy’s genocidal aggression, we have no [choice] of course but to win. This includes if the enemy continues its plan to destroy Ukraine by clearing its prisons for cannon fodder, outsourcing its killings [to] Wagner mercenar[ies and] increasing its manufacture of weapons and ammunition. Number two, we will stand up [to] fight in the face of an enemy alliance of malice with the likes of Iran, North Korea and Belarus. We’ll look to our own allies to apply pressure on those countries. Every time an Iranian drone heads towards a Kyiv or Mikolaev building, it’s a reminder this enemy has escalated the war to an international level. Every time that Belarus is used as a launching pad, it’s a reminder of complicit[y] in evil that cannot be tolerated. Those who help the invader circumvent military sanctions are accomplices in war crimes. Number three, we will never accept peace at any cost. We hear rumblings from states whose existence is not at stake [that] there needs to be negotiations. We will never agree to anything that keeps Ukrainian territories occupied. Peace with the aggressor now will lead to more atrocity later. Number four, we’ll pursue President Zelenskyy’s 10-point peace formula for a comprehensive, justice, and long term peace for Ukraine and security for the globe! In this respect, I hope that Australia will get involved in helping us to implement two tracks there that includes nuclear safety and the environment. … Number five, we’ll strongly partner with our allies for Ukraine to have the range of modern weapons and ammunitions it needs to not only defend itself, but to achieve victory. There is a very straightforward formula here: more military support equals a quicker end to Russia’s war on Ukraine and democracy. It’s not only war on Ukraine, it’s also a war on democracy. The last point, number six, of our framework for the future: every enemy, war criminal, every war enemy criminal must be punished. The establishment of a special tribunal will ensure the enemy’s political and military leadership will be prosecuted for their complicity in great crimes, including the very act of aggression. Ukraine ‘extremely thankful’ Australia is ‘in our blue and gold corner’: ambassador Myroshnychenko says “Australia has been a real mate to Ukraine in battling a brutal bully”. We know that Australia supports Ukraine because Australians stand up for what’s right. It’s who you are as people. We know Australia supports Ukraine because Australia supports the rule of law. We know, including through the strategy of MH17 and the pointless loss of 38 Australian lives, that Australians are appalled by the Russians’ actions and are committed to Ukraine. Ukrainians are extremely thankful that Australia is in our blue and gold corner. Key generous commitments have included placement assistance to over 6,000 [people], mainly women, children [and] refugees and material support of some $700m, including 19 legendary Bushmaster vehicles on our frontlines. Know this - each additional Bushmaster isn’t just a very handy battle vehicle, it’s the Australian spirit, the Anzac spirit, wheels that roll towards mutual victory. I shared a video on Twitter of the soldiers who are there with the Bushmasters. They’re thanking Australians for [their] support. And here I wish to formally acknowledge and thank the federal government, including the leadership shown by the prime minister. Anthony Albanese, who visited Kyiv last year, just as President Joe Biden did this week. Ambassador calls Russia ‘terrorist state’ for its opposition to democratic values After sharing some stories of individual Ukrainians who lives have been turned upside down by war, he goes on: Indeed, never for a minute should the West forget this: Ukrainians [see] themselves … fighting for you as much as they fight for Ukraine. The democratic world has recognised this is not only Ukraine’s war, but its war too. The world has made common cause with the fight for democracy and against authoritarianism, and provided Ukraine with material and moral support, for which we’re very grateful. The democratic world has been invigorated with a sense of unity and shared purpose in the name [of] liberal democratic values and in support of rules-based order. There’s now common recognition the rogue regime that seeks to wreck those rules for all must be cast as a pariah, a terrorist state. Ambassador: Russian invasion ‘genocide by displacement’ Myroshnychenko goes on to describe what the one-year anniversary marks: As a result, for the last 365 days, my countrymen and women have suffered senseless killings, brutal rapes and barbaric torture. 365 days in which we have seen the names of our cities – Irpin, Kramatorsk, Dnipro – have become synonymous with war crimes and atrocity. 365 days that we have endured air raid sirens screaming across our sophisticated cities, missiles made to destroy the battleships flying towards our homes. 365 days in which thousands of schools, hospitals, churches, museums, sports facilities, the infrastructure of wellbeing and community have been intentionally destroyed by enemy attacks. 365 days where 14 million people – the equivalent of more than half of Australia’s population – have been made homeless and millions of families separated in what can be called a genocide by displacement. 365 days since the start of systematic infiltrations, the disappearances that have robbed Ukrainians of their freedoms and their lives. He becomes emotional when talking about the last memory before the war of taking his son to a children’s playground, since destroyed: 365 days since we took our young son … to his beloved park in Kyiv. The kid’s playground which was destroyed by [a] Russian missile. And it is also 365 days … during which Ukraine conducted a successful defence against the world’s so-called second greatest military, while pundits picked us to last only three days. Myroshnychenko goes on to call out some of the reasons Russia has attempted to justify the invasion and instead says “the invader’s motive is revealed by its homicidal tactics”: Ladies and gentlemen, dignitaries, members of the parliamentary press gallery, so many of whom I have now met and come to admire. It is has been 365 days since the neighbouring state made the fatal mistake of invading my country. Their rationale has changed with the seasons, but rest assured, it was not to ward off the threat of Nato. Not to defend the interests of Russian speaking people, many of whom fill the ranks of Ukraine’s military. Not to de-Nazify a country that has one of the two Jewish presidents in the world. Not to reunite historic lands. Indeed Ukraine has a sovereign history since the 10th century, predating Moscow. Rather, the invaders’s motive is revealed by its homicidal tactics: To destroy Ukrainian society and culture, and to create a new colony and outpost for the criminal enterprise. The full-scale invasion is a modern, mechanised and murderous version of old-school imperialism and mafiosa mentality. Tsarism meets Scarface. A horrific throwback to an era that everyone thought over. After an acknowledgement of country the ambassador, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, says: It’s strange task to talk about this one-year [anniversary] of a full fledged Russian invasion. I’m asked to sum up a comment on what that unprovoked, illegal, and immoral war has wrought on Ukraine and the world, what it has taught us, after 12 months of Ukraine’s defence and what may happen in the future. As a proud Ukrainian who had the honour of representing his country here in beautiful Australia for the last 11 months, it’s hard to lay aside the emotions one feels about this horrible anniversary. But such is my task, to contain the hurt and the horror one holds in his heart for one’s countryman, and share some thoughts that aim to ensure you a singular key aspect: that Ukraine must win, and that Ukraine will win. David Crowe introduces the ambassador, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, saying he arrived in Australia as the Ukrainian ambassador in the months after the 24 February invasion. He has a background in the private sector and in the non-government sector, including as a cofounder of the Ukraine crisis media centre that amplified the voice of Ukraine at the time of the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Crow acknowledges members of the audience, including the high commissioner of the United Kingdom, the ambassador of Lithuania, the former deputy prime minister and Nationals leader Michael McCormack, Liberal senator David Fawcett, and the head of the Australian federation of Ukrainian organisations. Ukrainian ambassador to address national press club The Ukrainian ambassador, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, is about to speak at the national press club in Canberra on the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion. Before the ambassador speaks, a special video address is given to the people of Australia from the first lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska. She thanks Australia “for caring about the fate of the Ukraine and the world.” We feel your support because there are no borders or distances for help and compassion … I believe humanity and mutual assistance will prevail. We will win. Together with you. The national anthem of Ukraine is then sung by the Ukrainian community of Canberra choir before the ambassador steps up. Minister concerned of ‘strain’ facing aged care sector The residential aged care system is under significant strain, with two-thirds of providers making a loss late last year, AAP reports. The aged care royal commission, which uncovered a system under stress and in dire need of reform, recommended greater transparency of the finances of aged care sector players. The first release of data, covering the September 2022 quarter before major reforms were rolled out by the Labor government, found 66% of providers making a loss. The aged care minister, Anika Wells, said stronger reporting and oversight were key to improving the system. She said today: The snapshot shows the strain a decade of inadequate funding from the Coalition has put on the aged care sector. The report found aged care residents received an average 187 minutes per day of care, including 34 minutes from registered nurses and 138 from personal care workers. The government is seeking to lift this to 200 minutes (including 40 from registered nurses) from October and 215 minutes from late 2024. For-profit and non-profit providers returned a collective net loss before tax of $465.3m, or $27.90 per resident a day. A new funding model is being rolled out as well as funding for 24/7 registered nurses and a pay hike for the aged care workforce. These changes will support the future of Australia’s aged care service providers’ finances and operations for the long term. A bushfire has broken out at Kangaroo Flat, a locality north-west of Gawler in South Australia. The CFS have issued an emergency warning telling people it is too late to leave and they should take shelter. There were 3,950 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and eight people are in intensive care. That’s down from 4,166 cases last week, but deaths (which do lag cases) are slightly up from 24 last week. Queensland has reported more Covid cases than Victoria since mid-January. However the death count is consistently less. Equality Australia launches new campaign As Sydney prepares for the biggest Mardi Gras parade yet, Equality Australia and Mardi Gras have launched a new campaign calling for the New South Wales government to “act for equality”. The campaign is advocating for an end to conversion practices against the LGBTQI+ community, access to ID documents that include trans and gender diverse people, an end to the discrimination of LGBTQI+ teachers, and an end to “unnecessary” medical procedures on intersex children without their consent. The chief executive of Equality Australia, Anna Brown, said: All these issues and more need to be addressed. And we’re so pleased to see recently the multipartisan commitment to end damaging conversion [practices]. This was the sort of change we need to see in this state, and this is the sort of change that needs to be built upon in the coming weeks as we approach the New South Wales election. We call on our parliament to act now and ensure that everyone in our community is free from discrimination. Voters will ‘draw their own conclusions’ about who is being constructive on the voice, Albanese says Albanese is asked to respond to the deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley’s accusation that the voice to parliament is a re-election project for the Albanese government. The PM hits back that these are a “series of comments aimed at creating confusion” and that the Coalition know they are because a lot of the process leading up to the voice have happened on their watch. People will make their own judgment as to whether the Coalition are being constructive, as to whether they are trying to sit down. I have sat down and talked with Peter Dutton on no less than six occasions. No less than six occasions. What I have done, repeatedly, is not be prescriptive about what we are putting forward. I have put forward a draft in good faith at the Garma festival in July last year. Since then, I have not seen any suggestion or wording from Sussan Ley or anyone else in the Coalition to either the draft questions or the referendum changes. I sit in question time every day. They have an opportunity to ask questions about detail. That does not happen. What you have is a series of comments aimed at creating confusion and making more complex something that is actually very very clear. Do we recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our constitution and do we consult them on matters that affect them? It is not a right of veto. It won’t be a funding body, it won’t run programs. [The Coalition] know that that’s the case. Why do they know it? Because actually a lot of this process has occurred on their watch. In 2017, they were the government. They then set up a parliamentary committee chaired by Julian Leeser, the shadow minister, and Pat Dodson. It came to a unanimous parliamentary committee report. They then had, under Ken Wyatt, a process where Tom Calma and Marcia Langton produced a 270-page document suggesting options in detail. That went to their cabinet twice. They chose not to progress that at all. I am progressing it. I am being constructive. People will look at those comments and draw their own conclusions. Albanese calls on Dutton to campaign with Perrottet Asked about the purpose of his visit to Kiama, Albanese says he is campaigning with the NSW Labor leader and urges the NSW premier to invite the federal opposition leader to do the same: I am not meddling, I am campaigning for Chris Minns is to be the premier of New South Wales, and that is what I was doing last night when I was with Chris Minns. That is what I’ll be doing on a number of occasions in the lead up to the election. I encourage Dominic Perrottet to have Peter Dutton come to New South Wales and campaign next to him. ‘The IPA that put out these figures’: Albanese attacks super reporting The figures reported in the Australian came from the conservative thinktank, the IPA which Albanese was highly critical of: The IPA that put out these figures. The IPA have an agenda. The IPA have an agenda that is not about progressing Australia. The IPA have an agenda which is holding Australia back. And we have an agenda about progressing Australia. What we have said is that on superannuation, we want to see the objectives of superannuation enshrined, and the objectives are about people’s retirement incomes. That is the purpose of superannuation. Albanese’s superannuation entitlement questioned Taking questions, Albanese is asked about reports in the Australian that he will be able to access $400,000 a year in superannuation. The PM says the reporting is not accurate: The Australian report is wrong. It is wrong. It is not right. ‘No question that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine’ Albanese goes on to say “there is no question that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine” and calls on Putin to end the illegal war. I have seen it first-hand when I visited Kyiv and Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Housing blocks were blown apart. Residential areas bond with missile attacks as well as with tanks that got to the outskirts of Ukraine, just off Kyiv, just to the north. Today, I pay tribute to the people and leadership of Ukraine, and I can pledge in a bipartisan way that the Australian people stand with the people of Ukraine. We will also provide, and we have announced additional sanctions, against those people and companies who are involved in the Russian war machine. It is appropriate now, the sanctions now have hit more than 1,000, and will continue to act in coalition with other democratic forces around the world to impose these sanctions. The UN resolution that we’ve supported as well, calling upon a just solution. It has been supported by some 140 countries. But today, on this, on this time where it is one year since this illegal invasion, we again say to President Putin, stop this war now. Withdraw your forces now. This is an unprovoked attack. No one is threatening Russia. No one is threatening Russia sovereignty. There is no need for you to continue this war, which is causing damage not just to the people of Ukraine but to those Russian soldiers who are being sent to the frontline, who have caused so much death and devastation on both sides. Vladimir Putin can stop this, and he can stop this today. More military support for Ukraine Albanese goes on to speak about that extra support for Ukraine: Today, we are announcing additional support for uncrewed aerial systems. Some call them drones to provide support for the people of Ukraine. Today also, 200 Ukrainian soldiers will graduate from the Australian-based training that is occurring in the United Kingdom under Operation Kudu. I want to pay tribute to the Australian defence force personnel, who are undertaking this training, making sure that people who are enlisting to defend their country, their family, and their sovereignty and their future, get appropriate training before they are sent into this brutal war with the powerful Russian forces that seem determined to inflict damage in such an unprovoked, and, in some circumstances, just a random way. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking in Wollongong reflecting on the first year anniversary of war in Ukraine with a further $33m pledged in military aid: It is one year since the illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine by Russia. This was an unprovoked attack. It was an attack not only on Ukraine sovereignty, it was an attack on the international rules are based order. It was an attack on the United Nations and on the respect that we thought was something that was going to be permanent. Respect for people’s sovereignty and for nation states to be able to determine their own destiny. The truth is that Russia thought that this war would be over in a few days. I want to pay tribute to the courage and resilience and determination of the people of Ukraine, led by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and with such courage, who withstood an invasion by a much larger and more powerful country. They have made enormous sacrifice, a sacrifice in lives, a sacrifice in infrastructure, a sacrifice in their standard of living. They live under constant pressure. Airways. Atrocities committed by the Russian forces in Ukraine. And yet they have stood tall, not just in their interest but in the interests of all who hold democratic values so clearly around the world. That is why Australia continues to stand with the people and government of Ukraine. Greens bill would remove public school funding cap The Greens will introduce a bill to remove a 20% cap on commonwealth funding for public schools. Speaking at the Australian Education Union’s national conference on Friday, Greens spokesperson for schools, Senator Penny Allman-Payne, said she would introduce the legislation to end “buck passing” between state and federal governments. Since 2013, the commonwealth has contributed a maximum of 20% towards public schools’ schooling resource standard (SRS), while states and territories make up the rest. It meets 80% of private school SRS funding, and states 20%. Allman-Payne: Australia now has one of the most privatised school systems in the developed world. This is a critical juncture where the governments of Australia will, in effect, decide whether they are committed to public education or not. It is no exaggeration to say that public education faces an existential threat if we do not turn this around. Inequity in our education system will not be fixed by tinkering at the edges of the next national school reform agreement. We need to see a wholesale shift away from funding private schools, and reinvestment in our public education system. Earlier this week, the education minister, Jason Clare, confirmed his counterparts were finalising terms of reference to advice on reforms to embed in the next national school reform agreement (NSRA), which sets out the funding arrangements. It followed the release of a Productivity Commission report on the current NSRA, which said it was rolling out too slow, had minimal effect and lacked concrete targets. He has also committed to 100% SRS funding for government schools to close a gab between public and private institutions. Papua New Guinea’s foreign minister has confirmed the release of one hostage but says he “cannot guarantee” the safety of at least three others held in the southern highlands. At least four people, including an Australian-New Zealand archaeologist, were conducting fieldwork in a remote PNG region when they were captured by an armed group earlier this week. Speaking on the sidelines of the Pacific Islands Forum in Nadi, Justin Tkatchenko said negotiations to see the group released continued. He told Australian Associated Press: So far, so good. One hostage, who Tkatchenko confirmed was a local woman and who the ABC reports was the program co-ordinator, has been released. The archaeologist is a New Zealand national but Australian-based academic. Tkatchenko said a wide range of authorities in PNG were involved in negotiations to free the group. Our police force, our defence, our negotiators from the government side through the leadership of our minister for internal security. It’s a combined effort to look at the opportunistic situation by these people and see what their real intentions are. We don’t at all support these kinds of activities and the full force of the law will go down on those that have carried out these acts that society does not tolerate. While hopeful the talks would be fruitful, Tkatchenko said he couldn’t promise the hostages’ release. I can’t guarantee anything. The capture took place in the border region of the Southern Highlands, Hela and Western Provinces. The ABC reports the hostages have been moved between villages in the area. Their captors are asking for a ransom from the Australian and New Zealand governments. - AAP Messages of solidarity with Ukraine Australian leaders, including the prime minister Anthony Albanese and minister for foreign affairs Penny Wong, are sharing messages of solidarity with Ukraine on the one year anniversary of the Russian invasion. If you want to see how Russian forces have been pushed back in the year since they were closing in on Kyiv just two weeks into the invasion, this interactive shows you: New farmer funding for storing carbon in soil Farmers will soon be able to access a new fund to help find ways to store carbon in soil as a way of reducing emissions, AAP reports. The latest round of funding as part of a national program will see $20m set aside for land management projects to improve soil carbon levels. Grants of between $500,000 and $5m will be available for farmers and those in the agriculture sector to help develop solutions to measure soil carbon. Increasing amounts of carbon stored in soil, through ways such as increasing plant cover or land management practices, has been shown to help reduce emissions in the atmosphere. Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen said the program would allow for farmers to directly contribute to lowering emissions. Farmers are at the frontline of climate action and our government will continue to back them to develop technologies that will help them store more carbon, improve farm productivity and create regional job opportunities. We will continue to work with the agriculture sector to help them manage their soils, reduce emissions and actively participate in the carbon market. It is the second round of the $50m program. The first round saw almost $29m of grants awarded to develop soil carbon measurement technologies over the next two years. Monsoon trough forms over Cape York Peninsula The bureau of meteorology says that a monsoon trough has formed over Cape York Peninsula, which will remain slow-moving for the next week bringing lots of rain. Monsoon comes from an Arabic word meaning ‘season’, and refers to a seasonal wind that generates widespread, persistent rainfall across a region. Northern Australia is one of the many tropical regions in the world which experiences monsoons, which fill the sky with dark clouds causing widespread rain showers and thunderstorms which can last for a few days or even a week or more. Crackdown on child sexual abuse on social media welcomed Experts have lauded the eSafety Commissioner’s crackdown on social media and tech giants as a “world leading step” in addressing child sexual abuse material. On Thursday, it issued legal notices to Twitter, TikTok and Google forcing them to report how they tackled child sexual abuse and blackmail attempts on their platforms or risk fines of up to $687,000 a day. Prof Jon Rouse, from Monash University’s Artificial Intelligence for Law Enforcement and Community Safety Lab, said the serving of legal notices was a “world leading step” and a “major shot across the bow” by the commissioner. It is abundantly clear that we cannot rely on companies to self-regulate … this is a global issue and it requires a global response. The algorithms utilised by industry are designed to keep our children on device and there is insurmountable evidence that this is leading our children down dangerous pathways. The sextortion of children has been an evolving issue for over a decade. Increasingly and at a global level we are seeing children take their own lives as a direct result of threats by child sex offenders and in the latest evolution, by financial scammers. The University of Sydney’s digital cultures and online safety experts team said their eSafety research had indicated young people wanted platforms to make their online environments safer. Based on our survey findings, seven in ten young people have permanently stopped using a platform or app and 19% have deleted TikTok because they were using it too much, which along with Twitter and Facebook is the platform they feel most unsafe using. Young people develop their own practices of online safety and engagement tactics. Any rollout of new safety mechanisms will affect them and they are acutely aware of this. Platforms need to involve them in the process. Murray-Darling basin plan needs ‘the full suite of measures’, Plibersek says State and federal water ministers are meeting this morning in Sydney to discuss the Murray Darling basin plans, with water recovery targets due to be met by the middle of next year for projects. The federal water minister, Tanya Plibersek, told ABC News what she wanted to bring to the table ahead of the meeting: There is no way of delivering the basin plan in full without the full suite of measures that we need. We need infrastructure programs, we need on-farm efficiencies, we need water buybacks, we need a bit of common sense and compromise, and that’s what I’m bringing to the table. MinRes set up for ‘excellent year’ as lithium pays off Record earnings from lithium have driven a strong first half for mining company Mineral Resources, and it expects an even stronger second half. MinRes on Friday posted a five-fold increase in underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and impairment of $939m for the six months to 31 December. Net profit was $390m, up $370m from the same period last year, driven by lithium earnings after spodumene concentrate from its Mount Marion and Wodgina operations was converted into lithium battery chemicals. There were record earnings from Mount Marion, a hard-rock lithium mine in WA’s Goldfields region, under the agreement with China’s Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium. MinRes’s managing director, Chris Ellison, said: This half has seen us take the business from a mining services contractor and upstream miner to a leading downstream supplier of lithium to global auto manufacturers. During the half, MinRes delivered its first earnings from lithium battery chemicals produced from Wodgina spodumene. Wodgina, one of the largest known hard rock lithium deposits in the world, continues to ramp up with two trains operational and all three trains commissioned. MinRes also extended its lithium battery chemicals supply deal with China’s Ganfeng to December 2023, with an option for both parties to further extend it to the end of calendar 2024. – AAP The Australian Education Union is the latest organisation to back the Yes campaign in the voice to parliament referendum, saying its membership of school teachers overwhelmingly back the change and will work to support the movement. It comes just a day after the Coalition’s education spokesperson, Sarah Henderson, complained of “indoctrination” in classrooms around the voice and called on education groups to not take a stance on the referendum. The union movement is mobilising to support the voice, with Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary Sally McManus telling Guardian Australia last week that the ACTU executive was “unanimous in our support for the yes campaign”. Unions will mobilise in a large grassroots campaign effort including door-knocking and public events – McManus said they’d had an “overwhelming response from union members wanting to be involved in the campaign”. Today, the AEU lent its support. Its federal president, Correna Haythorpe, said the union and its Indigenous advisory committee would work to “educate members and the broader community on the significance of the voice to parliament”. Our union, which consists of public school, preschool and Tafe teachers, principals and support workers, overwhelmingly backs in First Nations Australians and their call for self-determination through constitutional reform. That’s why the AEU endorsed the Uluru statement five years ago and that is why we extend our unstinting support to the yes campaign today. And, that is why we will back this in with resources including a voice campaign lead officer and project officers. We cannot allow this critical opportunity to move forward towards reconciliation slip away from us. It is time to right the wrongs of the past and unite all Australians. On Thursday, Henderson told a universities conference that there was “no room for activism, campaigning or personal agendas in Australian educational institutions”. My colleague Caitlin Cassidy brought you that story yesterday: But speaking later at the same conference, keynote speaker Prof Megan Davis – co-chair of the Uluru statement, an expert adviser to the government on the referendum and pro vice-chancellor Indigenous at UNSW – said that it was the “role of universities” to support the voice campaign. I don’t really stomach that we are mere facilitators of the debate … universities say they don’t want to be political, but the decision not to take a stance for Uluru and the referendum for a voice to parliament is a political decision. There were 3,052 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and five people are in intensive care. After last week’s figures showed a slight increase, they are now trending downwards again from 3,344 cases and 56 deaths reported seven days ago. There were 6,545 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and 18 people are in intensive care. Cases are up by 500 on last week’s 6,033 while deaths are slightly lower than 51 recorded seven days ago. NSW Labor to ban dangerous benchtops if it wins poll Dangerous engineered stone benchtops will be banned under a NSW Labor election pledge to address rising rates of asbestos-like lung disease. Labor said it would aim for a national uniform ban by 2024 to outlaw manufactured stone with silica concentrations above 40%. The dust of silica, a common substance naturally found in sand, quartz and other stones, can cause pulmonary fibrosis years down the track, much like asbestos dust can. Labor pointed to a Queensland study suggesting up to one in four stonemasons could have silicosis. Leader Chris Minns said: Every day that goes by without reform is another day NSW workers lives are put at risk. If elected at the NSW election on March 25, the party would create a licencing scheme, more health screening and get Safework NSW to inspect more workplaces including quarrying and tunnelling projects. There must be a complete ban on manufactured stone, coupled with urgent reform of Safework NSW now, which Labor will deliver. The construction union CFMEU said all governments must fast-track a national ban on manufactured stone with silica. Incoming CFMEU National Secretary Zach Smith said: Otherwise, politicians will have to explain to victims and their families why they’re allowing the asbestos of our generation to kill more workers. - AAP From our economics correspondent, Peter Hannam: We’ve got to be the smart country, says Albanese Anthony Albanese is visiting Wollongong, Kiama and Nowra today. He phoned in to i98FM to speak about investment in renewable energy and skills. Albanese said: When I was infrastructure minister, we funded the smart infrastructure centre today, [providing] the energy futures skill centre with a $10m grant to the University of Wollongong. And we’re also putting $2.5m into upgrading equipment and material at the renewable energy training facility there in Wollongong … It’s a great region and you’ve been at the heart of manufacturing and skills and innovations and the University of Wollongong, of course, has such a fantastic history of scientific breakthroughs in areas like wave energy, was really pioneered in the University of Wollongong internationally, not just in Australia, so it’s great to be able to be investing once again in that magnificent facility with its world-class researchers. Asked if it is surreal being PM, he said: Absolutely. I grew up with a single mum in council housing in Camperdown. When I was growing up my prospects were … I hoped to get a job … I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do. My mum, encouraged me to get an education and to go to university, which was pretty good of her because she, you know, was really struggling that she saw that as the key to opportunity, which I do as well, whether it’s Tafe and a career in a trade or whether it is a going university, I think that education and skills are the key to not just individuals, improving their lot in life, but they’re the key to Australia, doing better, too. We’ve got to be the smart country. I don’t want to compete on the basis of our wages going down. I want to compete on the basis of how smart and innovative we are, and we can be a renewable energy superpower and part of this fits together, the energy future skills center with 180,000 fee-free Tafe places, and 10,000 energy apprenticeships where we will give people $10,000 to go into the new energy jobs of the future. So that as our economy changes, we have the skills based to maintain and build and look after new energy infrastructure. NSW Greens pledge push to raise age of criminal responsibility The New South Wales Greens will use the next term of parliament to push for the age of criminal responsibility in the state to be raised to 14, in line with changes recommended in a report commissioned by all the attorneys general. On Friday the crossbench party – which could hold significant sway in the event of a hung parliament at the state election next month – will announce its intention to move for the age of criminal responsibility in NSW to be lifted from 10 to 14 in the next term of parliament. It also wants the state to make it impossible for anyone younger than 16 to serve a custodial sentence. The party’s justice spokesperson, Sue Higginson, said such a change would bring NSW into line with other nations such as Germany and Spain, while also breaking the impasse on reform in Australia. She said: Medical and legal experts are in fierce agreement that children are developmentally incapable of criminal responsibility and the age should be raised. Primary school aged children should not be in prison. Other states and territories around the country are raising the age and it’s time that we join them. It’s disappointing that in spite of the evidence, we saw no progress on this issue in the last term of parliament.” The announcement comes after the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, last week indicated he was willing to abandon a long-running national process to raise the age of criminal responsibility and instead go it alone by introducing legislation into that state’s parliament. The Northern Territory last year raised the age to 12, while the ACT has committed to raising the age to 14 in a two-step process beginning this year. Late last year the standing council of attorneys general, chaired by the federal attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, released a previously secret report dated from 2020, which was commissioned to consider the issue. It made raising the age of responsibility to 14 its key recommendation. But progress had seemingly stalled until December last year when the council agreed to release the report, and committed to reexamining the issue by focusing on “the need for adequate supports and services for children who exhibit offending behaviour”. Energy ministers to turn congestion busters at first gathering of the year The federal, state and territory energy and climate ministers have gathered in the Hunter Valley region near Newcastle this morning to tick off a range of agreements. With the market operator this week warning of the need for “urgent” action to address looming “reliability gaps” in the grid as coal plants drop out and new renewables and batteries (and other storage) may not keep up. It looks like dealing with resolving congestion on the grid is at the top of the to-do list today. As we note this article this morning, one solar farm in NSW is unable to get almost half of its electrons to the market because of grid access: And as Dylan McConnell at the University of NSW notes, at times as much as 6 gigawatts of power is being “curtailed” because of those access issues. During December, for instance, solar farms in South Australia were in effect spilling about 20% of their output because they couldn’t get it to customers. It’s a complex issue and the first thing is not to make things more complicated, and so we understand the ministers will be nixing plans to introduce a pricing system based on location. Improving information and establishing a way to prioritise those solar and wind farms already generating power over newcomers look like being other matters agreed today. Queensland’s Mick De Brenni, meanwhile, will be pressing for a nationally coordinated hydrogen plan. (He may be the world’s first hydrogen minister.) Anyway, ministers will break up around 2.30pm AEDT, so we’ll learn more then. Australia would be ‘very concerned’ if China sent weapons to Russia, says trade minister Moving onto China, Farrell says Australia “would be very concerned” if Beijing was to provide ammunition to Moscow after Washington expressed concerns about this. Officials from Beijing and Australia met yesterday. Farrell said they discussed when he might visit China: One of the things I discussed was when I might head up to to China and so we’re continuing to have discussions about that. As you know, a couple of weeks ago, I met with my Chinese equivalent, Minister Wang. He very kindly invited me … to China to discuss all of the mutual issues between us. One of the things he said at that meeting was that the freeze is over and we are moving to a warm spring. I took that as a very positive sign. And so when I go to China, I want to make sure that we’ve got as much work done to make that a successful visit to to ensure that we get things back to a stable relationship. On whether the sanctions could be lifted, Farrell says “there’s a whole lot of positive signs in the whole range of products.” The day after we had our meeting, which was a virtual meeting, not a face to face meeting, for the first time, coal had been imported into into China. And since then, there’s been one or two other coal shipments that have arrived in China. I was at the Geraldton lobster factory earlier this week. And they told me that for the first time, in number of years when they submitted an application for an import permit, that that permit was not rejected. The Bulla dairy company have started to re-exporting some of their terrific dairy products into into China. The minister himself told me that the ban on timber products had been had been lifted. So right across a range of industries, I think there’s a there’s a positive sign there. We’ve got to go further. We want all of these impediments removed, and we want to get back to that normalised trading relationship that we had prior to the implementation of these impediments. Trade minister defends presence of Russian ambassador in Canberra The minister for trade and tourism, Don Farrell, is speaking to ABC Radio. On the first anniversary of the Russian invasion of the Ukraine, there is talk about what more Australia can do as a nation. RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas asks the minister why the Russian ambassador remains in Canberra. The Nine Fairfax papers are reporting that Asio dismantled a highly active hive off of Russian spies posing as diplomats in the embassy. The Russian ambassador remains in Canberra. Why shouldn’t he be expelled? Farrell: Look, if you expel the Russian ambassador, then you have no mechanism of communicating our displeasure with the with the decisions that the Russian government are taking. These are operational matters, of course, and they’re not the sort of matters that we discuss publicly. There was a report earlier this week by Asio about these matters. I’m very happy to leave it in the very capable of hands of Mr. Burgess. The Liberal deputy leader, Sussan Ley, and the education minister, Jason Clare, have gone toe to toe on superannuation. Ley has seized on remarks by assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, describing billions in super as “a lot of honey to be shared around”. Ley told Sunrise: The government said before the election ... they had no intention of changing superannuation. They floated the idea this week, now they seem to be making jokes about it, calling it a honeypot to be raided for the things they want to spend it on, instead of showing the fiscal responsibility and managing the economy in a way that actually protects the retirement incomes of Australians that have worked really, really hard ... I’ve met a lot of self-funded retirees who are totally unimpressed with this, because they’ve worked hard, they’ve put their money away and they’re not going to rely on the age pension when they’re older ... This is the problem, talking about it as if it’s honey to be raided and shared around well, it’s not honey, it’s not funny. We actually need the government to stick to its election promises instead of all of the different views that we’ve heard this week that actually seem to be saying to Australians, we don’t care about your superannuation, we want it ourselves. Clare responded: I don’t think this is a major change. We said two things. One, we think that we should make it clear in the legislation was super is for, that it’s for your retirement. It’s not to be ripped away for other reasons. And two, what the treasurer said is it’s worth having a conversation about the fact that for 1% of Aussies who’ve got 3m bucks or more in their superannuation should the tax concessions for them be the same for everybody else. I don’t know about you Nat I don’t have 3m bucks in my super. 99% of Australians don’t. We said let’s have a conversation about this and every Liberal MP across the country’s head exploded at that thought. I think that says a lot about the Liberal party. They say they’re for the suburbs, but when it counts, they’re really just for the multimillionaires. Coles and Woolworths take responsibility for soft plastic The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has provided an update on soft plastics after the sole soft plastic recycler, RedCycle, collapsed last year, saying supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths have agreed to take on responsibility for the soft plastic they sell. What I did at the time was get the big supermarket giants around the table. I said to them, you’ve got to take responsibility for the soft plastics that your businesses are generating. I’m very pleased today to tell you that the taskforce set up with the supermarkets has come to a conclusion and Coles and Woolies will take on responsibility for the tonnes of soft plastic that has been piling up in warehouses. The government we’re doing our share we’ve got about $60m specifically set aside for upgrading recycling of plastic, soft plastics and other hard to recycle plastics as part of a quarter of a billion dollar investment in upgrading our recycling facilities around Australia. I’m really hopeful that the supermarkets will soon be able to announce when we’re likely to see a restarting of the collection of soft plastics. We’ve got to keep this stuff out there environment, we’ve got to produce less of it in the first place. And make sure that we’re moving to a circular economy where we get use after use out of the materials that we produce. The foreign minister, Penny Wong, has spoken to ABC News Breakfast on the Ukraine war anniversary and added sanctions on Russia. Wong said: Today is the anniversary of the full scale invasion by Russia of Ukraine and we mourn those lost. We continue to condemn Russia’s illegal and immoral war and we stand with Ukraine. The government is demonstrating that by what we are doing in addition to what we have provided so far. We are providing additional defence capability, uncrewed aerial surveillance and I have issued more sanctions against Russia overnight, against 90 people and organisations which take our sanctions to in excess of a thousand. It is a heavy sanctions regime against a government which has chosen to engage in an illegal and immoral war, breaching sovereignty and the UN charter, which is why we have to stand against Russia. Wong was also asked about the possibility of China supplying arms to Russia, and she replied: What I would say is that Russia is a permanent member of the UN security council. It has a special responsibility to ensure that international law, including the UN charter which protects everyone’s sovereignty, is protected. This war, waged by Mr Putin, is an attack on sovereignty and an attack on the UN charter. We would urge China to do all it can to not only not escalate this conflict but to end it. ACTU calls out ‘shocking’ greed price spiral The national secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, has spoken to ABC News this morning following that finding from the Australia Institute that company profits, not wages, are driving soaring inflation. McManus: I reckon it’s shocking. I mean, I think your average Aussie already knows that companies are putting up prices more than they need to. And what that’s doing is driving profits and, of course, driving cost-of-living pressures. One of the most shocking stats that those economists showed was that the average inflation since the pandemic has been 5.2%. If it were not for those excessive profits, it would be 2.7%. Now, that’s within the RBA’s, you know, target, and they wouldn’t have needed to put up interest rates as they have. So, we’re just calling on companies to moderate their profit expectations, to cut their prices, and also calling on the RBA to stop their interest rate rises. … The whole wage price spiral thing was always a fantasy from the 1970s, it was never going to happen and it hasn’t happened. The RBA keeps getting this wrong all the time. Instead, what we’re seeing actually is a greed price spiral – that’s what’s happening. This inflation is driven not just by overseas supply issues, it’s been driven by excess profits. It’s about time that got called out. Why isn’t the RBA, you know, calling out companies and asking them to stop putting up prices way more than they need to? One year since Russian invasion of Ukraine Today, 24 February, marks the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The minister for veterans affairs, Matt Keogh, has made a statement affirming Australia continues “to stand with Ukraine’s brave Armed Forces and support them in their self-defence against Russian aggression”. He said Australia was proud to be providing training to Ukrainian recruits through the UK-based training program was called Operation Kudu. Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, reflected on the contributions of the bushmasters Australia has provided the Ukraine on ABC’s 7.30 program last night: Each Australian Bushmaster is more than just a hardy and handy protected vehicle, it’s actually the Anzac spirit, it’s Australian mateship. This is what is saving lives, helping Ukraine win. You can find a series of articles and interactive features marking the first year anniversary of the conflict here. A hive of foreign spies busted by Australia’s intelligence agency in the past year was reportedly linked to Russia. Nine newspapers on Friday cited unnamed sources as saying the spies posed as diplomats and had been operating for more than 18 months in multiple locations, including the Russian embassy in Canberra. They were reportedly trying to recruit Australians with access to classified information and steal data. In his annual threat assessment delivered earlier this week, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation chief said intelligence officers uncovered a group of spies and had them removed from the country. Director-General Mike Burgess said the “hive” was working undercover, and some of the spies had been put in place years earlier. Proxies and agents were recruited as part of a wider network. Burgess said on Tuesday: Among other malicious activities, they wanted to steal sensitive information. We watched them. We mapped their activities. We mounted an intense and sustained campaign of operational activity. We confronted them. And, working with our partners, we removed them from this country, privately and professionally. The hive is history. Comment is being sought from the federal government. - AAP NSW government accused of ‘double dipping’ on land offsets Anne Davies and Lisa Cox have brought you exclusive investigations this week as part of the “Sydney’s growing pains” series examining the spread of housing in the greater Sydney area. Cox’s story today reveals how Dominic Perrottet’s government is being accused of “double dipping” offsets by using land that’s already been put aside for conservation for Sydney’s koala habitat and some of Sydney’s rarest bushland. Have a read for yourself: Thanks to Martin for kicking things off, Natasha May now on deck with you. Health ministers are meeting today and the top issue on the agenda is tackling the growing popularity of vaping. The meeting comes after the Therapeutic Goods Administration finished consulting on ideas for a further restrictions on access to nicotine vapes. You’ll remember at the end of last year Guardian Australia’s medical editor Melissa Davey published a series of articles investigating how so many young Australians became hooked on vapes. Davey’s reporting showed most vapes contain nicotine, even though the substance is often not included in the ingredient list. Independent MP Kate Chaney told the ABC she believes the regulator should target vapes claiming to be nicotine-free: I think we need to end the black market in vapes by banning all importation and supplies of e-cigarette products, regardless of their labelled nicotine content, unless they’re actually going to a pharmacy for smokers with a prescription. If we just ban the lot, there isn’t really any compelling reason to have them, even if they don’t have nicotine in them. That means we can actually then have stronger border controls and enforce that, so that border force can actually intercept any e-cigarette products that aren’t bound for the pharmacy. ‘Economic fairytale’ The public narrative from the Reserve Bank and others that rising wage demands are causing inflation has been debunked in an analysis from the Australia Institute today. It found no evidence that wages were to blame, it says, instead blaming a “profit price spiral” and arguing that big business earnings account for 69% of the inflation. Jim Stanford, from the Australia Institute’s Centre for Future Work, said: We’ve been told a story that workers need to restrict wage growth and accept a permanent reduction in living standards in order to fix inflation. This evidence shows that’s an economic fairytale. Read the whole story here: Push for Pacific unity The Pacific’s moment for unity has arrived, with Australia and Fiji leading the way towards mending the region’s Micronesian rupture, Australian Associated Press reports. Leaders from the 18-member Pacific Islands Forum gather in Nadi today with the goal of cementing a deal that brings Kiribati back to the regional body. Amid heavy influence from China, President Taneti Maamau walked away from the forum last year, furious at other members backtracking from a previous agreement to rotate the grouping’s leadership. Since then, a heavy diplomatic effort – spearheaded from Canberra and Suva – has patched the rift. Penny Wong has visited 16 Pacific nations, pledging aid, signing deals and arguing for Pacific unity, which supports Australia’s strategic goal of sheltering the region from outsized Chinese influence. On her latest trip this week, she had plenty to announce, including an MoU with Kiribati which included the rebuilding of a wharf, a patrol boat and policing support, $10m in new funding for schools damaged in cyclones and $620m to fund healthcare programs in the Pacific and south-east Asia. Alongside Australia’s reorienting its foreign policy focus, incoming Fiji prime minister Sitiveni Rabuka has been credited with the key act to pacify Kiribati. Rabuka travelled to Kiribati last month – on an Australian defence plane – to formally apologise. The deal that followed will result in Micronesian countries all receiving new roles or offices, including a regional forum office in Kiribati, and Nauru picking the next secretary general. It now needs to be ratified at a meeting, which cannot be taken for granted. Hello. I’m Martin Farrer, welcoming you to our rolling news coverage. My colleague Natasha May will be taking over soon but in the meantime here are some of the big stories that have made news overnight. The yes campaign for the voice to parliament referendum was launched yesterday and involved a lively community forum in Perth that was packed out with hundreds of people wanting their say. Our correspondent Narelle Towie was there and she reports that there was some division of opinion among First Nations people but the new Greens spokesperson, Dorinda Cox, summed up well by saying, “We need a seat at the table.” In the same city today, Liberal deputy leader Sussan Ley will accuse Anthony Albanese of using the issue as a “re-election vanity project”. It is almost exactly a year since Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine in the early hours of 24 February. In a show of support for the embattled nation, the Albanese government is sending drones to assist the war effort and is stepping up sanctions against prominent supporters of the Putin regime, including the head of the Russian Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill. Penny Wong will be hoping today to cement a deal that brings Kiribati back to the fold of the Pacific Islands Forum when the latest meeting winds up in Fiji. Canberra and the Fijian government have put a lot of work into bringing the small nation back and Wong has made nine visits to the Pacific in as many months. She said in Nadi: A strong and united Pacific Islands Forum is in all of our interests. With that, let’s get going …"

In the time since, more than 7,000 civilians have reportedly been killed along with an estimated 300,000 Ukrainian and Russian military casualties. But today attention was partially on China, which insisted the west was making matters worse by arming Ukraine. “Adding fuel to the fire will only exacerbate tensions,” the deputy Chinese envoy to the UN, Dai Bing, said. The comment prompted a rebuke from the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, who called on China to tell Moscow to stop its aggression. That position was backed by Australia’s foreign minister, Penny Wong, who urged Beijing “to do all it can to not only not escalate this conflict but to end it”. There are few signs to suggest China is about to edge closer to the west on Ukraine. On Wednesday, Beijing’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, met Vladimir Putin in Moscow to deepen Sino-Russian relations. Top news Zachary Rolfe leaves Australia | The Northern Territory police officer cleared of murdering Kumanjayi Walker has left the country, only days after he said he was issued another disciplinary notice and informed he would be sacked because of his mental health. His father, Richard Rolfe, said he expected his son to return in several months. Hopes PNG hostages will be freed | Papua New Guinea’s foreign minister has confirmed the release of one hostage but says he “cannot guarantee” the safety of at least three others held in the southern highlands. At least four people, including an Australian-New Zealand archaeologist, were conducting fieldwork in a remote PNG region when they were captured by an armed group earlier this week. Greens push for more public school funding | The Greens will introduce a bill to remove a 20% cap on commonwealth funding for public schools. “Australia now has one of the most privatised school systems in the developed world,” the Greens senator Penny Allman-Payne said. A report commissioned by the Australian Education Union last year found public schools were underfunded by at least $6.5bn every year. Duck hunting season in Victoria gets green light | … but it will be about a month shorter than the average season and hunters will have a bag limit of four birds a day. The Victorian government has also announced a parliamentary inquiry into the future of duck hunting. New farmer funding for storing carbon in soil | Farmers will soon be able to access grants between $500,000 and $5m to help find ways to store carbon in soil as a way of reducing emissions. The funding is part of a national program that will see $20m set aside for land management projects to improve soil carbon levels. Meta profited from anti-LGBTQ+ ads | An example of PR and revenue coming unstuck. The social media company has a float in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras to show its support for the community, while at the same time accepting thousands of dollars from Australian groups promoting anti-LGBTQ+ messages on Facebook. New Lord of the Rings movies in the works | If you’re a fan of the trilogy like me, you’re probably swaying between pure excitement and deep anxiety if it’s not made to perfection. But yes, 20 years on, Warner Bros and New Line have signed a deal to bring Middle-earth back to cinemas. North Korea test-fires four missiles | This time the test was to demonstrate its ability to launch a nuclear attack. It caps a week of increased activity around the Korean peninsula, with Pyongyang conducting missile tests on Monday and the US holding joint air exercises separately with Japan and South Korea last Sunday.

                    "bodyText": "A “peace rally” due to take place in Berlin this weekend condemning western weapons exports to Ukraine has been criticised by the leadership of the leftwing party Die Linke for failing to distance itself from far-right groups that have announced their attendance. Police expect about 10,000 people to take part in Saturday’s rally in front of the Brandenburg Gate, which is co-organised by a renegade former leader of Die Linke, Sahra Wagenknecht. A counter-protest supported by politicians and public intellectuals including the Nobel literature prize-winner Herta Müller has been registered in Berlin for Friday afternoon. In a TV interview on Wednesday, Wagenknecht said she did not want to see neo-Nazi symbols at her protest, but she fell short of uninviting groups of a nationalist persuasion. “We have made clear that rightwing extremist symbols have no place at this rally,” she told the public broadcaster ZDF. “But of course, everyone is welcome who wants to demonstrate for peace with an open heart.” Wagenknecht set out the theme for her rally in a “manifesto for peace” published earlier this month, in which she argued that western military support for Ukraine’s defensive effort was merely prolonging a conflict that would inevitably be settled at the negotiating table. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s demands for fighter jets and long-range missiles could drag Germany into a nuclear war, it warned. The manifesto’s original 70-odd signees were mostly prominent figures of the soft-left western German peace movement of the 1970s and 80s, including the singer-songwriter Reinhard Mey, the centre-left EU commissioner Günter Verheugen, and the former head of the German Protestant church Margot Kässmann. The open letter’s co-author, the journalist Alice Schwarzer, was once Germany’s most prominent feminist icon. In the weeks since its release, however, the manifesto has also been embraced by the far right. Among the half a million signatures since added to the online petition is that of Tino Chrupalla, a co-leader of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, while a link to the manifesto has been shared online by Hans-Christian Strache, the disgraced former leader of Austria’s far-right Freedom party. Groups from the rightwing extremist spectrum, including Saxony’s Freie Jugend youth movement and the neo-fascist magazine Compact, have encouraged participation in Saturday’s gathering on their social media channels. While Wagenknecht’s condemnation of such support has remained ambiguous, her party has distanced itself from the event. “After intensive consultation, the party leadership has decided not to join this callout,” said Die Linke’s federal chair, Tobias Bank, criticising the lack of a clearly drawn line of separation from “well-known Nazis” mobilising supporters for the rally. Kässmann also announced she would not join the rally, decrying the lack of condemnation of “nationalist and misanthropic persons and groups”. Even without their participation, Saturday’s rally is likely to mark a further fusion of old left and nationalist protest groups, which was a hallmark of the Querdenker protests against lockdown measures and vaccine mandates during the Covid-19 pandemic. Last weekend, a rally organised by the Querdenker scene mobilised about 10,000 protesters outside the annual Munich Security Conference, police said. A second protest march made up mainly of leftwing protesters drew about 2,700 people. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago, more than 100,000 people took to the streets of Berlin in protest. Organisers had expected 20,000. Days before the invasion, Wagenknecht portrayed the threat as an invention of western media, telling the broadcaster ARD: “We can be happy that Putin isn’t what he is portrayed to be, namely a crazy Russian nationalist who gets high on moving borders. If that were so, negotiations would probably be pointless.” According to a survey by the pollster Forsa released on Wednesday, only 22% of Germans believe Putin is interested in negotiations, though a majority of AfD supporters hold that view."

                    "bodyText": "Good evening, we are closing this live blog now. You can read our full report on the UN vote here. The UN voted by 141 to 7 with 32 abstentions to call for Russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Ukraine, a sign that the international community has not wavered in its determination to condemn Russia’s actions. In the last vote taken immediately after Russia had annexed republics in the east of Ukraine, Russia was condemned 143 to five with 35 abstentions, the bulk of these in Africa. Applause broke out when the result was announced. Russia had worked hard to try to end its isolation by pointing to the damage the west was caused by pouring arms into the region or by pointing to the growing hunger crisis that it blamed on western sanctions. Ukraine foreign minister Dymotro Kuleba said: By voting in favour of today’s UNGA resolution 141 UN member states made it clear that Russia must end its illegal aggression. Ukraine’s territorial integrity must be restored. One year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion global support for Ukraine remains strong. The seven countries voting against the resolution were Belarus, Mali, Nicaragua, Russia, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea. The resolution was adopted after amendments proposed by Belarus that would have stripped much of the language were resoundingly defeated. Foreign ministers and diplomats from more than 75 countries addressed the assembly during two days of debate, with many urging support for the resolution that upholds Ukraine’s territorial integrity, a basic principle of the UN charter that all countries must subscribe to when they join the world organisation. China abstained as the UN passed a nonbinding resolution calling for Russia to end hostilities and withdraw from Ukraine. It also called for a halt to fighting and for peace in Ukraine, Reuters reports. The 141-7 vote with 32 abstentions, which included China, was slightly below the highest vote for the five previous resolutions approved by the 193-member world body since Russia sent troops and tanks across the border into its smaller neighbour. After the year-long Russian invasion of Ukraine, drone footage shows the scale of destruction in Bakhmut. The Russian military has increased its attacks around the eastern city before the 24 February anniversary. Drone footage shows rows of destroyed and burned out buildings, with no civilians in sight. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, clashed with Chinese diplomats on Thursday, passionately rejecting their claim that the west was adding fuel to the fire by arming Ukraine. Baerbock said it was time for China to tell Russia to stop its aggression. In a debate at the UN general assembly marking the anniversary of the invasion and seen as a key barometer of the state of world opinion, China intervened to present itself as above the conflict by proposing a catalogue of measures: a ceasefire, dialogue, security guarantees for Russia, protection of civilians and the upholding of territorial integrity. The deputy Chinese envoy to the UN, Dai Bing, insisted the west was worsening the situation by arming Ukraine, saying: “Adding fuel to the fire will only exacerbate tensions”. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said countries like India and South Africa, which have not joined the West in denouncing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, were likely on a trajectory away from alignment with Moscow but that process would not happen “in one fell swoop”. “There are countries that have longstanding, decades-long relationships with Russia, with the Soviet Union before, that are challenging to break off in one fell swoop. It’s not flipping a light switch, it’s moving an aircraft carrier,” Blinken said in an interview with The Atlantic, marking the one year anniversary of the war. India has faced pressure from the West to distance itself from Moscow after Russian invaded Ukraine. New Delhi has thus far resisted that pressure, citing its longstanding ties with Russia and its economic and oil needs, Reuters reported. Russia has been India’s largest weapons supplier since the Soviet Union days. However, Washington in recent years has looked to woo New Delhi away from its traditional military supplier. India is desperate to modernise its largely Soviet-era fighter jet fleet to boost its air power after concerns over Russian supply delays due to the Ukraine war. “India for decades had Russia at the core of providing military equipment to it and its defenses, but what we’ve seen over the last few years is a trajectory away from relying on Russia and moving into partnership with us and other countries,” Blinken said. Ukraine’s supporters urged the UN general assembly to vote for a resolution that calls for Russia to end hostilities and withdraw from its neighbour on the eve of the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion. The draft resolution is all but certain to pass later in the day but is nonbinding, the Associated Press reported. Diplomats from Ukraine’s allies seek to win over more nations that have been ambivalent toward the war in previous votes, including China. Foreign ministers and diplomats from more than 75 countries addressed the assembly during two days of debate, with many urging support for the resolution that upholds Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Venezuela’s deputy ambassador addressed the council on behalf of 16 countries that either voted against or abstained on almost all of five previous resolutions on Ukraine: Belarus, Bolivia, Cambodia, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Laos, Mali, Nicaragua, North Korea, St. Vincent, Syria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. While other countries focused on Russia’s actions, deputy ambassador Joaquín Pérez Ayestarán said Wednesday that all countries without exception “must stringently comply with the United Nations Charter.” He said the countries in his group were against what he called divisive action in the general assembly, and for “a spirit of compromise.” In his own appeal, Polish foreign minister Zbigniew Rau said Ukrainians deserve “not only our compassion, but also our support and solidarity.” It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The EU’s top diplomats have failed to finalise the bloc’s tenth round of sanctions against Russia, which would ban the sale of more military-critical technologies. Talks are understood to be stuck on the question of rubber trade with Russia. Ambassadors are due to resume talks on Friday, the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday. The UN’s general assembly is expected to vote on a motion calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. The 193-member assembly is expected by a massive majority to endorse the broad resolution, but China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain. China’s deputy UN ambassador, Dai Bing, has said “brutal facts offer ample proof that sending weapons will not bring peace”. Dai, speaking during a UN debate on a draft resolution urging Russia to leave Ukraine, said Beijing’s “top priority is to facilitate ceasefire and cessation of hostilities without delay”, adding that it was ready to “continue playing a constructive role” in resolving the crisis in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he had not seen any Chinese peace plan but he would welcome a meeting between Ukraine and China. “We would like to meet with China,” he said during a news briefing in Kyiv with the visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said the alliance had seen signs that China was considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against taking any such step. Stoltenberg said potential Chinese assistance would amount to providing “(direct) support to a blatant violation of international law, and of course (as) a member of the UN security council China should not in any way support violation of the U.N. charter, or international law.” The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has warned China that providing any material support to Russia’s war effort would be “a very serious concern”. “We will certainly continue to make clear to the Chinese government and to companies and banks in their jurisdictions what the rules are regarding our sanctions and the serious consequences that they would face in violating them.,” she told reporters in India. Russian forces have stepped up attacks along the eastern frontline of the war in Ukraine as Kyiv prepares to mark the sombre first anniversary of the invasion. Amid fears that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, intends to mark the anniversary with fresh attacks on key cities, Ukraine’s general staff said it had repelled 90 assaults in the east and north-east in the past 24 hours. Russia has fired 5,000 missiles at Ukraine and carried out almost 3,500 airstrikes, according to Ukraine’s general staff. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the first anniversary of the Russian invasion approaches. Sánchez said: “I’m back in Ukraine a year after the start of the war. We will stay by Ukraine’s side until peace returns to Europe.” Sánchez confirmed that Spain will send Ukraine six Leopard tanks, but would be willing to up that number to 10 if necessary. He also said Spain had offered to train Ukrainian soldiers in how to use the tanks. “We understand that Ukraine needs more [weapons] to put an end to this aggression and recover its territories,” Sánchez said. “ Vladimir Putin has said Russia will deploy its new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, nicknamed “Satan 2”, as well as roll out hypersonic missiles and new nuclear submarines. In an address to mark the “Defender of the Fatherland” holiday on Thursday, Putin said Russia would “pay increased attention” to boost its nuclear forces on land, sea and in the air. The founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has said much-needed ammunition for his troops has been dispatched, after a public row in which he accused the military leadership of treason. In an audio clip on Thursday, Prigozhin said he felt the pressure he and others had put on the defence ministry had paid off, and he had been told that ammunition was now on its way. Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin was able to pass UK anti-money laundering checks by submitting a utility bill in the name of his elderly mother, according to a report. Leaked emails seen by the Financial Times show that the law firm Discreet Law in 2021 requested identification documents from Prigozhin, who has been placed under sanctions and accused of human rights abuses around the world, before taking him on as a client. The sanctions introduced by G7 nations against Russia since its invasion of Ukraine should be applied by all G20 countries, Italy’s economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, has said. In a statement issued on the sidelines of a summit among G20 finance leaders in Bengaluru, Giorgetti said the sanctions “must be applied not only by the G7 countries but also by the G20 countries”. Australia will send drones to Ukraine and expand sanctions against Russian government, military and media figures as part of a pledge to stand with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. The package includes travel bans and asset freezes for a further 90 Russian individuals and 40 Russian entities, including the state-owned media outlet Sputnik. Finland will send three Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, the country’s defence ministry has said. The announcement comes after Sweden’s defence minister said it was open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks. The Czech government has also announced a further military aid shipment to Ukraine. A US army official has said it could take up to two years for M1 Abrams tanks to be delivered to Ukraine. The US announced in January that it would supply Ukraine with 31 advanced M1 Abrams tanks worth $400m in a matter of months. But plans are still being drawn up on how they will be delivered, and when, the US army secretary Christine Wormuth said. The UK’s former prime minister Boris Johnson has warned that Britain’s security could be at risk if Ukraine does not win in the face of Russian aggression. In an interview with Sky News ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war, Johnson urged the UK to “break the ice” by becoming the first country to supply Ukraine with fighter jets. Moldova has dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry that Ukraine planned to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniestria after staging a false-flag operation, and called for calm. The Russian ministry said Ukraine planned to stage an attack purportedly by Russian forces from Transnistria as a pretext for the invasion, state media reported. Ukrainian courts have brought charges against nearly 300 individuals for war crimes since Russia’s full-fledged invasion a year ago, an official has said. Ukraine’s prosecutor coordinating war crimes cases in The Hague, Myroslava Krasnoborova, said 26 individuals had been tried and convicted and a total of 276 individuals charged with war crimes. The Kerch bridge, which connects mainland Russia to the occupied Crimean peninsula, has reopened to road traffic, deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin has announced. The bridge, which has served as a vital transport link for carrying military equipment to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, was partially destroyed by a deadly blast in October. A Russian man who has lived in Poland for many years has been charged with spying, Polish authorities said. The suspect was detained in April on suspicion of collecting information between 2015 and April 2022 concerning the military readiness of Poland’s armed forces and of Nato, and then passing them on to the Russian intelligence service. A series of cyber-attacks on Wednesday targeting Italian companies and public institutions, including the websites of the defence ministry and police, were “a threat, a warning” from Russia, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, has said. The attacks, which were claimed by the Russian group NoName057, came after Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s visit to Ukraine this week. The White House has said Joe Biden will meet virtually on Friday with G7 leaders and Volodymyr Zelenskiy and will announce a new wave of sanctions against Russia. The leaders of the 27 EU countries have issued a joint statement on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, vowing not to rest until Ukraine prevails, is rebuilt and “justice is done”. Ukraine is “part of our European family” and its people have shown “resolve in defending democracy and freedom, resilience in the face of hardship and dignity when confronted with Russia’s crimes”, the statement reads. The European Union will continue to support Ukraine in political, economic, humanitarian, financial and military terms, including through swift coordinated procurement from European industry. We will also support Ukraine’s reconstruction, for which we will strive to use frozen and immobilised Russian assets in accordance with EU and international law. We will further increase collective pressure on Russia to end its war of aggression. The EU and its partners have acted “swiftly and in unity” and will continue to stand firmly and in full solidarity with Ukraine and its people “for as long as it takes”, it continues. We support President Zelenskiy’s peace formula. Together with our international partners, we will make sure that Ukraine prevails, that international law is respected, that peace and Ukraine’s territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders are restored, that Ukraine is rebuilt, and that justice is done. Iran will abstain from a UN general assembly vote on the draft resolution calling for Russia to unconditionally and immediately withdraw from Ukraine’s territory, my colleague Patrick Wintour writes. The 193-strong UN general assembly is expected by a massive majority to endorse the resolution later today, although China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain. Ukraine’s central bank has unveiled a commemorative banknote to mark the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion. One side of the 20-hryvnia (£.0.45) note shows three soldiers raising the national flag, while the other side features an image of two hands tied with tape, an apparent allusion to the alleged war crimes that Ukraine has accused Russian forces of committing. Ukraine’s national bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, said during a presentation in Kyiv: To mark the anniversary of the war, we decided to launch a commemorative banknote which will depict on a small piece of paper a year of emotions, patterns, content and iconic things. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has confirmed that his country will send Ukraine six Leopard tanks, but would be willing to up that number to 10 if necessary. He also said Spain had offered to train Ukrainian soldiers in how to use the tanks. “We understand that Ukraine needs more [weapons] to put an end to this aggression and recover its territories,” Sánchez said. “That’s why we’re stepping up our military contributions and that’s why my government announced its decision on Wednesday to send six Leopard tanks.” Speaking on Thursday during his second visit since Russia invaded almost a year ago, he also underlined Spain’s commitment to Ukraine and to the 165,000 Ukrainian refugees it has taken in over the past 12 months. Sánchez said that Ukraine – unlike its enemy – was “fighting for what is right and it knows what it’s fighting for”. He added: Ukraine is fighting for its survival while your enemy is fighting for power. Its fight is not honourable; yours is a song of freedom. A US army official has said it could take up to two years for M1 Abrams tanks to be delivered to Ukraine. The US announced in January that it would supply Ukraine with 31 advanced M1 Abrams tanks worth $400m in a matter of months. But plans are still being drawn up on how they will be delivered, and when, CNN quotes the US army secretary Christine Wormuth as saying. The US army is “looking at what’s the fastest way we can get the tanks to the Ukrainians”, she said. It’s not going to be a matter of weeks, I will say that. None of the options that we’re exploring are weeks or two months. There are longer timelines involved. But I think there are options that are less than two years, less than a year and a half. But again we have to look at the pros and cons of each of them. Among the options being presented to the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, were building tanks “from scratch”, she said. She added that another option would include “countries that we’ve sold tanks to previously”, which could “presumably get tanks to the Ukrainians more quickly but might disrupt relations with important allies”. Earlier we reported that four people have been arrested in London on suspicion of criminal damage, after the campaign group Led By Donkeys painted a Ukrainian flag on the road outside the Russian embassy. Here’s the clip: China’s deputy UN ambassador, Dai Bing, has told the UN general assembly that one year into the Ukraine war, “brutal facts offer ample proof that sending weapons will not bring peace”. Dai, speaking during a UN debate on a draft resolution urging Russia to leave Ukraine, said China’s position on Ukraine has been “consistent and clear”. Beijing’s “top priority is to facilitate ceasefire and cessation of hostilities without delay”, he said, adding that it was ready to “continue playing a constructive role” in resolving the crisis in Ukraine. On the subject of nuclear war, Dai said “all parties should strictly abide by nuclear conventions”, adding: Nuclear weapons cannot be used, nuclear war cannot be fought. The UK’s former prime minister Boris Johnson has warned that Britain’s security could be at risk if Ukraine does not win in the face of Russian aggression. In an interview with Sky News ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war, Johnson urged the UK to “break the ice” by becoming the first country to supply Ukraine with fighter jets. He said: What the Ukrainians want is F-16s. As it happens, we don’t have F-16s but we do have Typhoons. I think there’s an argument for the UK breaking the ice and giving them some Typhoons. If it’s a question of training people up to use those machines – we can do that. The consequences of a Russian victory would be Vladimir Putin’s ability to threaten the Baltic states, and that the UK’s security would be “much more gravely in peril”. On the subject of China, Johnson said Beijing would be making an “historic mistake” if it supplied Moscow with weapons and that he was “very concerned” to see China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, meet Vladimir Putin yesterday. Why does China want to be contaminated by association with Putin, who has revealed himself to be this gangster and adventurer? I think it would be a big, big mistake by China. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said Ukraine has become the centre of the European continent in a video address ahead of the first year anniversary of Russia’s invasion. Many had predicted that Kyiv would fall “in a matter of days” when it was invaded by Moscow’s troops last February, but this did not account for “the moral and the physical courage” of Ukraine’s people, she said. Europe “is with you”, she said, addressing the Ukrainian people. We have been with you in this existential fight from the beginning. We have massively stepped up our economic, humanitarian and military support. Because Ukraine has become the centre of our continent, the place where our values are upheld, where our freedom is defended, where the future of Europe is written. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, says he and the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, discussed ways to end Russian aggression based on the principles of the UN Charter and international law. Posting to Twitter, Kuleba said he commended Guterres’ efforts to enable the Black Sea Grain Initiative which he said “will go down in history as his legacy”. Meeting in Brussels, the EU’s top diplomats failed to finalise the bloc’s tenth round of sanctions against Russia, which would ban the sale of more military-critical technologies. Ambassadors are due to resume talks on Friday, the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, had told Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the EU aimed to have the measures in place by 24 February. Talks are understood to be stuck on the question of rubber trade with Russia. The latest package would ban the export of components for drones and helicopters and spare parts for vehicles, items that were found on the battlefields of Ukraine and had been missed off previous ones. The search for consensus came as British, US and EU officials met on Thursday to share information about sanctions, amid a growing international push to curb apparent Russian attempts to dodge the restrictions with the help of its neighbours. Following the start of western sanctions in February 2022, exports from Europe and the US to Russia fell sharply, but some trade has been rerouted to former Soviet states in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Western exports to Kyrgyzstan and Armenia have increased dramatically, with smaller but noticeable increases to Kazakhstan and Georgia, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Western officials fear this trade is being sent on to Russia, which has also seen a jump in imports from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates since the war began. Officials are now studying on a case-by-case basis how to prevent any sanctions dodging, via a mix of persuasion or threats to cut market access. Earlier this week ten EU countries called for a crackdown on Russia’s attempts to source military parts from front companies in neighbouring countries, with threats to cut off access to the EU market to companies and individuals involved in such trade. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russian forces have stepped up attacks along the eastern frontline of the war in Ukraine as Kyiv prepares to mark the sombre first anniversary of the invasion. Amid fears that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, intends to mark the anniversary with fresh attacks on key cities, Ukraine’s general staff said it had repelled 90 assaults in the east and north-east in the past 24 hours. Russia has fired 5,000 missiles at Ukraine and carried out almost 3,500 airstrikes, according to Ukraine’s general staff. The UN’s general assembly is expected to vote on a motion calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. The 193-member assembly is expected by a massive majority to endorse the broad resolution, but China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he had not seen any Chinese peace plan but he would welcome a meeting between Ukraine and China. “We would like to meet with China,” he said during a news briefing in Kyiv with the visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said the alliance had seen signs that China was considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against taking any such step. Stoltenberg said potential Chinese assistance would amount to providing “(direct) support to a blatant violation of international law, and of course (as) a member of the UN security council China should not in any way support violation of the U.N. charter, or international law.” The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has warned China that providing any material support to Russia’s war effort would be “a very serious concern”. “We will certainly continue to make clear to the Chinese government and to companies and banks in their jurisdictions what the rules are regarding our sanctions and the serious consequences that they would face in violating them.,” she told reporters in India. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the first anniversary of the Russian invasion approaches.

The Czech government has also announced a further military aid shipment to Ukraine. A Russian fighter plane crashed on Thursday and the pilot was killed in Russia’s Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine. The cause of the crash was a “technical malfunction”, according to preliminary information, the Russian state-run Tass news agency cited the ministry as saying. The plane crashed in an uninhabited area and there were no reports of other damage, it said. Moldova has dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry that Ukraine planned to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniestria after staging a false-flag operation, and called for calm.

I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. The Kerch bridge, which connects mainland Russia to the occupied Crimean peninsula, has reopened to road traffic, deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin has announced. The bridge, which has served as a vital transport link for carrying military equipment to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, was partially destroyed by a deadly blast in October. The exact cause of the blast remains unclear. Russia blamed Ukraine for the explosion, but Kyiv has not claimed responsibility. In a statement posted to Telegram, Khusnullin said: All lanes of the Crimean bridge are fully open to car traffic 39 days ahead of schedule. He said the reopening of the bridge was a “big gift for the Defender of the Fatherland Day” national holiday celebrated in Russia today. He added that “work was carried out round-the-clock” by around 500 people to complete the repairs, and that other parts of the bridge were still being restored. The EU should consider appointing a full-time commissioner to oversee the drafting and enforcing of sanctions so they can be used effectively against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Lithuanian foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, told the Guardian in an interview. He was speaking in London as he met the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, to discuss the summer Nato summit in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, where the Baltic states will press for progress on Ukraine’s Nato application and for more to be done to defend the bloc’s European flank. He said he was frustrated with the number of exemptions to sanctions, saying “sometimes we derogate so much that we can call this a hole in a ship that can sink the ship”. He cited the derogations from sanctions provided in September for coal, cement and wood on the basis that they were linked to protecting food security. There needs to be a clearer explanation of these derogations. In some cases there may be a link, but when we talk about cement, I am sorry, I cannot find the link with food security. While EU officials had been appointed to check how sanctions were being implemented, Landsbergis argued, “sanctions are becoming so important to the EU single market that we may need to go further and make sanctions policy a political portfolio”. Read the full story here: The UN’s general assembly is meeting for a second day ahead of a vote on a motion calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. The 193-member assembly will vote on the motion, backed by Kyiv and its allies, to mark the first anniversary of Moscow’s full-fledged invasion of its neighbour, which UN secretary general António Guterres denounced as an “attack on our collective conscience”. In an address marking the start of the session yesterday, Guterres warned of a further escalation of the war, and referred to “indirect threats” of the use of nuclear weapons and “irresponsible” military actions in the vicinity of nuclear power plants. The assembly is expected by a massive majority to endorse a broad resolution demanding Russia unconditionally and immediately withdraw from Ukraine’s territory, but China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain, underlining their alienation from what they regarded as the west’s war. You can watch the vote and the preceding debate live here: Unlike the UN’s security council, Russia has no veto right in the general assembly. The resolutions are not binding under international law. Since Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the assembly has passed a series of resolutions condemning its actions. In March last year, 141 of the 193 UN member states voted in favour of a resolution calling Russia to withdraw from Ukraine “immediately” In April, the assembly decided with a much narrower majority of 93 votes to suspend Russia’s UN human rights council membership in Geneva. In October, 143 member states condemned Russia’s “illegal annexations” of Ukraine’s Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhia regions. Anna and her husband left Russia after Putin’s mobilisation. She told Clea Skopeliti of the difficulties in Turkey and the potential dangers of moving back. “A few months after leaving Russia, I came back to Moscow. We’re still figuring out what to do. We’re considering moving back to Russia because we can’t afford living in Turkey, since the rouble has become much weaker. “But it’s not safe. There could be another mobilisation at any moment, and we worry my husband could be drafted because he has an engineering background. It is so hard to make all those decisions when there are so many things you don’t know. I’m really scared of him being drafted because if they take you, there’s nothing you can do. There are two options: war or jail.” Read more here: Here are the latest images from Ukraine: Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday he had not seen any Chinese peace plan but he would welcome a meeting between Ukraine and China, Reuters reports. “We would like to meet with China,” he said during a news briefing in Kyiv with the visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Earlier on Thursday, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance had seen signs that China was considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against taking any such step. The announcement came days after the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned China of consequences if it provided material support to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Stoltenberg told Reuters: We haven’t seen any supplies of lethal aid from China to Russia, but we have seen signs that they are considering and may be planning for that …That’s the reason why the United States and other allies have been very clear, warning against that. And China should of course not support Russia’s illegal war. There was no immediate comment from China, but its foreign ministry said earlier on Thursday that any potential intelligence on arms transfer by China to Russia that the US planned to release was just speculation. The Guardian reporters Shaun Walker, Isobel Koshiw, Pjotr Sauer, Morten Risberg, Liz Cookman and Luke Harding revisited one of the grimmest chapters of Russia’s war – the ruin of Mariupol. For more than 80 days, the Russians bombarded Mariupol, determined to take the port city even if they had to raze it to the ground first. After Russian forces finally crushed Ukrainian resistance last May, they set about putting their stamp on Mariupol, erasing evidence of the recent atrocities and of past Ukrainian history in the city. A year on from the invasion of Ukraine, the Guardian tells the story of Mariupol – perhaps the bloodiest and most shocking chapter of Russia’s brutal war. Read more here: The sanctions introduced by G7 nations against Russia since its invasion of Ukraine should be applied by all G20 countries, Italy’s economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, said on Thursday. In a statement issued on the sidelines of a summit among G20 finance leaders in Bengaluru, Giorgetti said the sanctions “must be applied not only by the G7 countries but also by the G20 countries”, Reuters reports. “Otherwise Russia circumvents the sanctions system and the effects risk falling short of our expectations,” the minister added. Australia will send drones to Ukraine and expand sanctions against Russian government, military and media figures as part of a pledge to stand with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. Announcing the new support on the first anniversary of Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine, the government said the sanctions would also target “those spreading mistruths to justify this war”. The package includes travel bans and asset freezes for a further 90 Russian individuals and 40 Russian entities, including the state-owned media outlet Sputnik. Read more here: Earlier we reported that the US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, had stepped up calls for increased financing support to Ukraine during a news conference in India. Yellen also told journalists that talks between the US and China on economic issues would resume at “an appropriate time”, while warning Beijing that providing any material support to Moscow’s war effort would be “a very serious concern”. On the subject of US sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine, she said: We have made clear that providing material support to Russia or assistance with any type of systemic sanctions evasion would be a very serious concern to us. And we will certainly continue to make clear to the Chinese government and to companies and banks in their jurisdictions what the rules are regarding our sanctions and the serious consequences that they would face in violating them. The warning came a day after China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, met Vladimir Putin in Moscow, as Beijing and Moscow reaffirmed their close bilateral relationship before the first anniversary of the start of the Ukraine war. Ukrainian courts have brought charges against nearly 300 individuals for war crimes since Russia’s full-fledged invasion a year ago, an official has said. Ukraine’s prosecutor coordinating war crimes cases in The Hague, Myroslava Krasnoborova, said 26 individuals had been tried and convicted and a total of 276 individuals charged with war crimes. The convictions were for crimes including rape and murder, the shelling of residential buildings, cruel treatment of civilians and pillaging, she said. More than 71,000 alleged war crimes have been registered in Ukraine since 24 February 2022, she said. The “atrocities and destruction” caused by Russia were “colossal and endless”, she said during a briefing. Millions of people have been forced to leave everything behind. Massive missile attacks are destroying the civilian infrastructure and many tragically lost their lives. This damage cannot be undone, but what we can do is to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice. Ukraine’s law enforcement agencies are being assisted in war crimes investigations by dozens of countries and institutions. Russia has denied committing atrocities or targeting civilians. Anti-war protesters in London poured yellow and blue paint on to the road outside the Russian embassy to create a giant Ukrainian flag before the one-year anniversary of Russia’s full-fledged invasion. The campaign group Led By Donkeys halted traffic before spreading more than 300 litres of paint across the road, using wheelbarrows and brushes to make the 500 square metre flag. In a statement, the group said Ukraine was “an independent state and a people with every right to self-determination”, adding: The existence of a massive Ukrainian flag outside Putin’s embassy in London will serve to remind him of that. The group said the non-toxic, solvent-free and fast-dry edible paint was washable and designed for road art. Four people – three men and one woman – were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and obstructing the highway, the Metropolitan police said. A Russian man who has lived in Poland for many years has been charged with spying, Polish authorities said. The suspect was detained in April on suspicion of collecting information between 2015 and April 2022 concerning the military readiness of Poland’s armed forces and of Nato, and then passing them on to the Russian intelligence service. An indictment was submitted last Friday to Gdansk district court against the suspect, a spokesperson for the Gdansk district prosecutor’s office said in a statement. They said the Russian citizen’s “espionage activity was focused on military units located in the north-eastern part of Poland, as part of which he carried out tasks of reconnaissance of important elements of the Polish armed force”. The case was one of “several” concerning activity for the Russian and Belarusian intelligence services against the Polish military, they added. North Korean state media have marked the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by blaming Nato and calling the US’s involvement a “trail to self-destruction.” In comments to the state-run news agency KCNA, reported by Reuters, Kim Yoo-chul, described as an international affairs critic, said the conflict in Ukraine was the “inevitable product of coercion and hegemony” by the US and its allies. He wrote: If Ukraine had not blindly taken part in the US policy of anti-Russian confrontation, if it had abandoned the dirty demons of the United States and promoted reconciliation and unity with its neighbours, the situation would not have reached the point where it is as bad as it is now. The current situation in Ukraine once again proves that there can be no peace in the world at any time unless the United States’ policy of force, tyranny and greedy aggression … is ended. North Korea has forged close ties with Russia since Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It has publicly supported Moscow in statements as well as at the UN, and has expressed support for Russia’s proclaimed annexation of parts of Ukraine. Here are some images we have received of Ukrainian army volunteers receiving Challenger tank training at a military base in southern England. Based on the UK’s basic soldier training, the course covers weapons handling, battlefield first aid, fieldcraft, patrol tactics and the law of armed conflict. Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said a series of cyber-attacks on Wednesday targeting Italian companies and public institutions, including the websites of the defence ministry and police, were “a threat, a warning” from Russia after the prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s visit to Ukraine this week. The attacks, which caused limited damage due to strong cyber-defence systems being in place, were claimed by the Russian group NoName057, which wrote on Telegram that Italy was “Russiaphobic”, while referring to the government’s approval of a sixth military aid package for Ukraine. Tajani made the comments to reporters on the sidelines of the UN’s emergency special session in New York marking one year since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Meloni met Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Tuesday on her first visit to Ukraine since she came to power in October. Meloni pledged that Italy would continue to give “military, financial and civil support”. “Those who support Ukraine, even militarily, are those who work for peace,” she said. Vladimir Putin has said Russia will deploy its new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, nicknamed “Satan 2”, as well as roll out hypersonic missiles and new nuclear submarines. In an address to mark the “Defender of the Fatherland” holiday on Thursday, Putin said Russia would “pay increased attention” to boost its nuclear forces on land, sea and in the air, Reuters reports. The Russian leader, who has in recent days has signalled he is ready to rip up the architecture of nuclear arms control, invoked the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany to argue that Russia needed modernised armed forces to guarantee its sovereignty. It comes after he said Russia would halt its participation in New Start, the last major remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the US. In his address today, Putin said the Sarmat silo-based intercontinental ballistic missiles would be deployed this year. The RS-28 Sarmat liquid-fueled missile has been in development for years. Russia said it had test-launched the missile in April 2022. The US believes Russia carried out a test of the Sarmat just before President Joe Biden’s visit to Kyiv earlier this week and that the test failed, CNN has reported. The Russian defence ministry has not commented on that report. In addition, Putin said Russia would continue mass production of air-based hypersonic Kinzhal systems and would start mass supplies of sea-based Zircon hypersonic missiles. In remarks issued by the Kremlin earlier today, Putin said: With the adoption of the Borei-A nuclear-powered submarine project ‘Emperor Alexander III’ into the navy, the share of modern weapons and equipment in the naval strategic nuclear forces will reach 100%. Emperor Alexander III, first launched in December, is the seventh Borei-A class submarine and can each carry 16 Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Putin said Russia would develop all parts of Russia’s conventional armed forces, improve training, add advanced equipment, bolster the arms industry and promote soldiers who had proven themselves in battle. He said: A modern, efficient army and navy are a guarantee of the country’s security and sovereignty, a guarantee of its stable development and its future. Therefore, we will continue to pay priority attention to strengthening our defence capability. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong taking over the live blog from Geneva Abdul. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The Ukrainian comedian Vasyl Baidak sparks an unlikely and enduring friendship with retiree Iryna Terekhova when he joins a group of young people from Kyiv to rebuild her home, in a new Guardian documentary. Terekhova, a devout Orthodox Christian, lives in a farming village in the Chernihiv region. Her house was destroyed during the Russian occupation of March 2022. She reflects on a traumatic time when she was forced to share her cellar with Russian soldiers who said they had come to liberate her, but who devastated her village. Refusing to leave the area where she has lived most of her life, Terekhova is galvanised by the entrepreneurial spirit of the young Kyiv builders, while Baidak proves that humour is the vital ingredient to bolster their collective spirit. “I wait for the war to end, that’s when our new year will begin. For now, 2022 still continues,” concludes Iryna. Hello and welcome to those now following today’s live coverage on the war in Ukraine. It’s 1pm in Kyiv. On the eve of the anniversary of the start of the war, Vladimir Putin has threatened to strengthen Russia’s nuclear forces. His comments were released before an address to mark Thursday’s Defender of the Fatherland public holiday. And Nato’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, says the military alliance has seen “some signs” that China may be planning to support Russia in its war in Ukraine, and strongly urged Beijing to desist from what would be a violation of international law. The UN general assembly is expected to endorse a broad resolution demanding Russia unconditionally and immediately withdraw from Ukraine’s territory by a massive majority. But China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain, underlining their alienation from what they regarded as the west’s war. We’ll have more on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Russia is intensifying hostilities in Ukraine a year after its invasion in a deliberate attempt to deplete Ukrainian forces, the Ukrainian military said on Thursday. The fiercest fighting remained around the eastern city of Bakhmut, Brig Gen Oleksiy Gromov said, according to Reuters. Finland will send three Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, the country’s defence ministry said, according to Reuters. The founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force has said much-needed ammunition for his troops has been dispatched, after a public row in which he accused the military leadership of treason. In an audio clip on Thursday, Prigozhin said he felt the pressure he and others had put on the defence ministry had paid off, and he had been told that ammunition was now on its way. A Russian fighter plane crashed and the pilot was killed in Russia’s Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine, on Thursday . The cause of the crash was a “technical malfunction”, according to preliminary information. The plane crashed in an uninhabited area and there were no reports of other damage. Sweden is open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine as it prepares to present another package of aid to help Kyiv fight off the Russian invasion, the country’s defence minister said. Moldova dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry on Thursday that Ukraine planned to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniestria after staging a false-flag operation, and called for calm. The US Treasury secretary stepped up calls for increased financing support to Ukraine, as the US readies an additional $10bn in economic assistance in the coming weeks. Janet Yellen said it was critical for the IMF to “move swiftly” towards a fully financed loan programme for Ukraine. ‘I think he is not going to stop’, the UK defence secretary has said of Vladimir Putin’s war. Ben Wallace said the conflict in Ukraine could last another year. PA news also reported that Wallace stressed that the war was “not a Nato conflict”. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the first anniversary of the Russian invasion approaches. Sánchez said: “I’m back in Ukraine a year after the start of the war. We will stay by Ukraine’s side until peace returns to Europe.” The town of Vuhledar, in southern Donetsk oblast, has experienced heavy shelling again, according to the UK MoD’s latest defence intelligence update. “There is a realistic possibility that Russia is preparing for another offensive effort in this area despite costly failed attacks in early February and late 2022,” the update on Thursday morning said. The Chinese government did not consult with Kyiv when preparing its peace plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian official said on condition of anonymity. Vladimir Putin will use an address to mark Thursday’s Defender of the Fatherland public holiday to threaten to strengthen the country’s nuclear forces. Putin said that for the first time, Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles – a weapon able to carry multiple nuclear warheads – would be deployed this year. Russia is intensifying hostilities in Ukraine a year after its invasion in a deliberate attempt to deplete Ukrainian forces, the Ukrainian military said on Thursday. Brig Gen Oleksiy Gromov said Russia had set the goal of capturing all the territory it does not control in the two regions that make up the industrial Donbas area of eastern Ukraine by the summer, Reuters reports. The fiercest fighting remained around the eastern city of Bakhmut, he told a military briefing on the eve of Friday’s anniversary of the invasion. Gromov said: The enemy, having an advantage in the resource of human mobilisation, is deliberately intensifying hostilities in an effort to deplete the units of the armed forces of Ukraine … In the short term, it is important for the Kremlin to capture the key settlements in the Donetsk region, and in the future to capture [all of] the Donetsk and Luhansk regions before the summer. Finland will send three Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, Reuters cites the country’s defence ministry as saying on Thursday. The announcement comes after Sweden’s defence minister said it was open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks. As reported earlier, the Czech government has announced a further military aid shipment to Ukraine. Here are some of the latest images from Ukraine: The Czech government has approved a further military aid shipment to Ukraine and will continue to send equipment from stocks, the defence minister, Jana Černochová, said on Thursday. Černochová did not disclose details of specific equipment being shipped, reports Reuters, but said the country had so far sent 38 tanks, 55 armoured vehicles, four aircraft and 13 self-propelled howitzers from its military reserves, alongside larger shipments from the private sector. The founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force has said much-needed ammunition for his troops has been dispatched, after a public row in which he accused the military leadership of treason. On Wednesday, Yevgeny Prigozhin published a grisly image of dozens of men who he said had been killed because commanders including the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov, had withheld ammunition to spite him, Reuters reports. Neither man commented but the defence ministry rejected the charge. In an audio clip on Thursday, Prigozhin said he felt the pressure he and others had put on the ministry had paid off, and he had been told that ammunition was now on its way. “So far it’s all on paper but, so we have been told, the principal documents have already been signed,” Prigozhin said. A Russian fighter plane crashed on Thursday and the pilot was killed in Russia’s Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine. The cause of the crash was a “technical malfunction”, according to preliminary information, the TASS news agency cited the ministry as saying. The plane crashed in an uninhabited area and there were no reports of other damage, it said. In a post on the Telegram messenger app, Belgorod’s governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the emergency services and investigators were on the scene near the town of Valyuki, and the reason for the crash was being established. Mikhail Afanasyev wants your letters, write Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer. The Russian journalist from Abakan in Siberia was jailed last year for writing about a small group of national guardsmen who had refused to fight in Ukraine. But Afanasyev remains defiant, while local supporters crowdfund thousands of dollars to pay off his legal fines. “It is the duty of every person to expand the horizon of freedom by his actions, so that light pours in and overcomes the darkness,” Afanasyev wrote from pre-trial detention in a letter to his supporters this month. “I really ask you to write to me, very much! It helps me a lot … I just want to be a journalist, faithful to my profession to the end and defend its values.” Read more of the story here: Sweden is open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine as it prepares to present another package of aid to help Kyiv fight off the Russian invasion, its defence minister told the local news agency TT. The latest instalment Sweden has delivered to Ukraine since the invasion includes armoured infantry fighting vehicles, which the defence minister, Pal Jonson, told Reuters would be the country’s main contribution to Ukraine in terms of equipment for ground warfare. Sweden is also preparing to send Ukraine the advanced Archer artillery system to Ukraine, and support has been growing in the Swedish parliament for additionally contributing some of the country’s around 120 Leopard tanks. “We are open to that and we are in close dialogue with above all Germany about it,” Jonson was quoted by TT as saying. Moldova has dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry on Thursday that Ukraine planned to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniestria after staging a false-flag operation, and called for calm, Reuters reports. Earlier we reported on Russia’s defence ministry accusing Ukraine of planning to invade Moldova’s breakaway Transnistria region after a false-flag operation, citing reports from the RIA news agency. The ministry said Ukraine planned to stage an attack purportedly by Russian forces from Transnistria as a pretext for the invasion, according to RIA. Separately, the Tass news agency quoted the Russian deputy foreign minister Mikhail Galuzin as saying the west had instructed the Chisinau government to stop all interaction with the Moscow-backed Transnistrian administration. Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, accused Moscow earlier this month of planning a coup to overthrow the government and drag Transnistria into its war. The mainly Russian-speaking region broke away from the then Soviet Moldova in 1990. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, pro-Russia separatists fought a bloody war with the Moldovan government forces. The US Treasury secretary has stepped up calls for increased financing support to Ukraine, as the US readies an additional $10bn in economic assistance in the coming weeks. In remarks prepared for delivery to a news conference as G20 finance leaders gathered on the outskirts of the Indian technology hub of Bengaluru, Janet Yellen said it was critical for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to “move swiftly” towards a fully financed loan programme for Ukraine, Reuters reports. As President Biden has said, we will stand with Ukraine in its fight – for as long as it takes. Continued, robust support for Ukraine will be a major topic of discussion during my time here in India. Yellen added: Our economic assistance is making Ukraine’s resistance possible by supporting the home front: funding critical public services and helping keep the government running. In the coming months, we expect to provide around $10bn in additional economic support for Ukraine. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian founder of the Wagner mercenary group, was able to pass UK anti-money laundering checks by submitting a utility bill in the name of his elderly mother, the FT reports. Leaked emails seen by the Financial Times show that the law firm Discreet Law in 2021 requested identification documents from Prigozhin, who has been placed under sanctions and accused of human rights abuses around the world, before taking him on as a client. As part of anti-laundering checks, Prigozhin’s Russian lawyers forwarded the London-based law firm a copy of his passport and a gas bill in the name of his then 81-year-old mother, Violetta, for an address in St Petersburg, the FT reports. Discreet Law’s founder, Roger Gherson, said the firm “cannot comment on confidential communications with [its] former clients”.

Ben Wallace has said the conflict in Ukraine could last another year. PA news also reported that Wallace stressed that the war was “not a Nato conflict”. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the first anniversary of the Russian invasion approaches.

Vladimir Putin will use an address to mark Thursday’s Defender of the Fatherland public holiday to threaten to strengthen the country’s nuclear forces. Putin said that for the first time, Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles – a weapon able to carry multiple nuclear warheads – would be deployed this year. Joe Biden has said Putin made a “big mistake” by suspending the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US. The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said Russia’s decision to suspend its participation in the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty with the US will not increase the risk of a nuclear war. Russia’s parliament on Wednesday approved Putin’s move to suspend the treaty. The Biden administration is considering releasing intelligence it believes shows that China is weighing whether to supply weapons to support Russia’s war in Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “an affront to our collective conscience”, at a two-day meeting of the general assembly. Friday’s anniversary is “a grim milestone for the people of Ukraine and for the international community”, he said in New York. Two civilians were killed in Russian shelling of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine on Wednesday, according to regional officials. Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the regional military administration, said an 81-year-old woman and a 68-year-old man were killed during shelling of the village of Novotyahinka, about 40km (25 miles) from Kherson city. A Russian missile strike on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv on Wednesday morning left two civilians wounded, Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv region, has said. Biden vowed that the US would defend “literally every inch of Nato” territory, ahead of talks with Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9), a collection of nations on the most eastern parts of the Nato alliance and closest to Russia. All members of the B9 have jointly condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine, a Polish presidential adviser said. Biden and the B9 leaders “reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine and underscored their shared commitment to stand with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes” according to a White House account of Wednesday afternoon’s meeting in Warsaw. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, has met Vladimir Putin in Moscow, as China and Russia reaffirm their close bilateral relationship. Wang told Putin that Beijing would play a “constructive” role in reaching a political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine, the Russian state-owned Tass news agency reported. Earlier on Wednesday, Wang met Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, where he said he expected to reach a “new consensus” on advancing the relationship between the two allies. Xi Jinping, China’s president, is expected to visit Putin in Russia in the coming months. Vladimir Putin has praised soldiers who are “fighting heroically, courageously, bravely” to “defend the fatherland”, in a speech at a rally in Moscow to mark a year of war in Ukraine. Thousands gathered at Luzhniki stadium in Moscow for a concert marking Defenders of the Fatherland Day. EU countries have failed to agree on a new set of sanctions against Russia meant to be in place for the one-year anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, four diplomatic sources in Brussels have told Reuters. More talks among Brussels representatives of EU member countries were due on Thursday afternoon, said the sources. On Thursday 2 February, my friend Pete Reed died as he tried to evacuate civilians in the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, writes Cengiz Yar. Based on footage we now have of the incident, his vehicle was hit by a Russian anti-tank missile. He was killed in the blast, and others in his team were severely injured. Reports suggest it was likely a double-tap strike, a technique used frequently by Russia in Syria, where an attack is made to draw in additional support and recovery operations before a second attack is made. Pete was one of the most selfless people I’ve ever met. You should know a bit about the good he did in this world. I met him in the spring of 2016 over some drinks in Iraq, where I worked as a photographer. He was loud, a bit goofy, and trying to do some good. What good? He hadn’t quite figured that out yet. Read more by Cengiz Yar here: Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the first anniversary of the Russian invasion approaches. Arriving in the Ukrainian capital, Sánchez said: I’m back in Ukraine a year after the start of the war. We will stay by Ukraine’s side until peace returns to Europe. Sánchez, who last visited Ukraine in April, is understood to have travelled to Ukraine at Zelenskiy’s invitation. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last another year, PA news reports. When asked whether he could see the war continuing for another 12 months, Wallace told LBC: I think we will. I think Russia has shown a complete disregard, not only for the lives of the people of Ukraine but for its own soldiers. We are sitting here 12 months in and 188,000, actually more now, Russian soldiers are dead or injured as a result of this catastrophic miscalculation and aggression by President Putin. Wallace added: When someone has crossed the line and thinks it is OK to do that to your own people, running effectively a meat grinder for an army, I think he is not going to stop. He told LBC that planes currently held by Nato countries could be given to Ukraine, and he stressed that the war was “not a Nato conflict”, according to PA news. Wallace said: There is already talk, I think, of an eastern European country supplying MiG-29s … We’re not going to see Nato, we’re going to see countries that are members of Nato potentially put in air force equipment or MiG-29. The town of Vuhledar, in southern Donetsk oblast, has experienced heavy shelling again, according to the MoD’s latest defence intelligence update. “There is a realistic possibility that Russia is preparing for another offensive effort in this area despite costly failed attacks in early February and late 2022,” the update on Thursday morning said. Colonel General Rustam Muradov, commander of Russia’s Eastern Group of forces, is likely to be under intense pressure to improve results in Vuhledar after harsh criticism from the Russian nationalist community, according to the MoD. “However, it is unlikely that Muradov has a striking force capable of achieving a breakthrough,” it said. Ukraine’s boxing federation has joined a growing boycott of the amateur world championships over the inclusion of Russian and Belarusian boxers, who have been allowed to compete with national flags and anthems. The FBU vice-president, Oleg Ilchenko, told the public broadcaster Suspline on Wednesday that its boxers would not compete in this year’s men’s and women’s championships, which will be held in New Delhi and Tashkent respectively. Both competitions are organised by the International Boxing Association, led by a Russian, Umar Kremlev. The United States, Ireland and Britain are among nine other federations that have boycotted the women’s event, while several have also pulled out of the men’s tournament. Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukraine on Thursday of planning to invade Moldova’s breakaway Transnistria region after a false-flag operation, the RIA news agency reported. The ministry said Ukraine planned to stage an attack purportedly by Russian forces from Transnistria as a pretext for the invasion, according to RIA. Separately, the Tass news agency quoted the Russian deputy foreign minister Mikhail Galuzin as saying the west had instructed the Chisinau government to stop all interaction with the Moscow-backed Transnistrian administration. Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, accused Moscow earlier this month of planning a coup to overthrow the government and drag Transnistria into its war. The mainly Russian-speaking region broke away from the then Soviet Moldova in 1990. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, pro-Russia separatists fought a bloody war with the Moldovan government forces. The 193-strong UN general assembly is expected by a massive majority on Thursday to endorse a broad resolution demanding that Russia unconditionally and immediately withdraws from Ukraine’s territory, but China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain, underlining their alienation from what they regard as the west’s war. The resolution has been the subject of weeks of negotiations and has required Ukraine’s allies in the G7 to persuade Kyiv not to press for very specific wider demands and risk seeing some of the countries that have previously voted for Ukraine’s sovereignty peeling off. The last time the UN general assembly voted on the issue, 143 countries backed Ukraine and only five supported Russia. Ukraine has been warned that the number may slip to 135 in Thursday’s vote, marking the first anniversary of the war’s start, but Ukraine and its allies have been involved in last-minute high-level lobbying of countries such as Pakistan and India. Ukraine’s top diplomat Dmytro Kuleba said his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi shared “key elements of the Chinese peace plan” during their meeting in Germany earlier this week. “We are looking forward to receiving the text because this is not something that you can, you know, make your conclusions on just after hearing,” he added. Speaking at the UN general assembly on Wednesday, Kuleba told reporters that Ukraine was open to a conversation on the matter. “We are ready to talk with those who have ideas, other ideas which can help us achieve this goal,” he said. But the Ukrainian official warned on Wednesday that no peace plan should cross the “red lines” outlined by Kyiv. “The red lines are the principles of the UN charter, including respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine,” the official said. “There will be no bargaining with any Ukrainian territories. The president [Volodymyr Zelenskiy] has already clearly said that.” The Chinese government did not consult with Kyiv when preparing its peace plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian official said on condition of anonymity. “China did not consult with us,” the official told reporters, including AFP. Beijing has promised to publish its proposed “political solution” to Ukraine conflict this week, in time for the first anniversary of Russia’s 24 February invasion of its neighbour. Nato’s chief said on Wednesday that the military alliance had seen “some signs” that China may be planning to support Russia in its war in Ukraine, and strongly urged Beijing to desist from what would be a violation of international law. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, also told the Associated Press in an interview that the alliance, while not a party to the war, would support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. Asked whether Nato had any indication that China might be ready to provide arms or other support to Russia’s war, Stoltenberg said: “We have seen some signs that they may be planning for that and of course Nato allies, the United States, have been warning against it because this is something that should not happen. China should not support Russia’s illegal war.” Stoltenberg said potential Chinese assistance would amount to providing “[direct] support to a blatant violation of international law, and of course [as] a member of the UN security council China should not in any way support violation of the UN charter, or international law.” On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin hosted the Chinese Communist party’s most senior foreign policy official, Wang Yi, raising concern in the west that Beijing might be ready to offer Moscow stronger support in the almost year-old war. Vladimir Putin will use an address to mark Thursday’s Defender of the Fatherland public holiday to threaten to strengthen the country’s nuclear forces. “As before, we will pay increased attention to strengthening the nuclear triad,” Putin said in remarks issued early on Thursday morning by the Kremlin. The “triad” refers to nuclear missiles based on land, sea and in the air. Putin said that for the first time, Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles - a weapon able to carry multiple nuclear warheads – would be deployed this year. “We will continue mass production of air-based hypersonic Kinzhal systems and will start mass supplies of sea-based Zircon hypersonic missiles,” Putin said.

                    "headline": "UN calls for immediate Russian withdrawal from Ukraine",
                    "bodyText": "The UN has overwhelmingly voted to call for Russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Ukraine, marking one year since Moscow’s invasion by calling for a “comprehensive, just and lasting peace”. Applause broke out when the result was announced, with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, calling the resolution “a powerful signal of unflagging global support for Ukraine” in a tweet late on Thursday. The resolution on Thursday night saw 141 countries in favour with seven against and 32 abstentions, including China. Russia had worked hard to try to end its isolation by blaming the west for pouring arms into the region and by pointing to the growing hunger crisis it blamed on western sanctions. But Ukraine’s allies for their part had tried to maximise consultations, and in the resolution put a heavy emphasis on the willingness of Ukraine to seek dialogue. Ukraine was also persuaded to remove planned references to taking the Russian leadership to a special tribunal for committing war crimes. Several speakers said such a move would only make the search for peace more elusive. However, Ukraine’s allies failed to improve on numbers seen in the last vote on the issue in October immediately after Russia annexed republics in the east of Ukraine. In that vote 143 countries backed the resolution, with five against and 35 abstentions. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said: “By voting in favour of today’s UN general assembly resolution 141 UN member states made it clear that Russia must end its illegal aggression. Ukraine’s territorial integrity must be restored. One year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion global support for Ukraine remains strong.” The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said as the assembly came to a close: “The UN general assembly has spoken very clearly. This vote shows that the international community stands with Ukraine.” Among the big countries abstaining on Thursday, Thailand said it did not want to become involved in a morality play, adding that billions of bystanders were bearing the brunt of the war. South Africa stressed that the principles of territorial integrity in the UN Charter were sacrosanct, and applied in the case of Ukraine, but claimed the resolution would not advance the cause of peace. The Chinese deputy envoy to the UN, Dai Bing, said the west was throwing fuel on to the fire by arming Ukraine. That would only exacerbate tensions, he said. Leading the abstention camp, he claimed: “One year into the Ukraine crisis, the conflict is still grinding on and growing in scale, wreaking havoc to countless lives. A spillover effect is intensifying. We are deeply worried about this. China’s position on the Ukraine issue is consistent and clear. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected. The purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be observed. The legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously.” His remarks provoked a powerful rebuttal from Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, rejecting his claim that the west was indulging in military spending at the expense of other priorities more important to ordinary people. She said it was specious to claim the military aid was worsening the crisis since if the west did not supply aid, the aggressor would be free to capture Ukraine and destroy the UN Charter. Because the UN Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, is paralysed by Russia’s veto power, the General Assembly has become the most important UN body dealing with Ukraine. Though General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding – unlike Security Council resolutions – they serve as a useful barometer of world opinion. Catherine Colonna, the French foreign minister – one of many European foreign ministers to travel to New York for the debate prior to the vote – warned that those that abstained would in fact be siding with the aggressor. She said none could sleep easy in a world in which a great power – one with nuclear weapons and a permanent Security Council member – could, at its own discretion, decide to attack its neighbours. “Russia is trying to convince some of you that its attempts to upset the world order and impose a strength-based order will work in their favour. This is an illusion. The facts bear this out. It was Russia and Russia alone that wanted the war.” With Associated Press"

                    "bodyText": "Steve Borthwick has said he wants license to pick the strongest England team possible amid fears that an exodus of players heading abroad after the World Cup will weaken his hand. The Rugby Football Union’s strict criteria currently stops Borthwick from selecting players based outside England but with cash-strapped Premiership clubs unable to compete with overseas rivals, powerbrokers are under pressure to change that policy as part of an overhaul to the domestic game. Luke Cowan-Dickie, Sam Simmonds, Joe Marchant and David Ribbans have all agreed moves to France after the World Cup while Jack Willis is on a short-term deal with Toulouse and only currently available for England after the RFU granted temporary dispensation to players who lost their jobs at Wasps or Worcester. Due to the union’s long-standing policy, however, Willis – and all those heading abroad – will not be eligible after the World Cup while Manu Tuilagi and Billy Vunipola have also been linked with moves to Japan. Overseas clubs are able to offer more lucrative contracts than their Premiership counterparts, who are operating under a reduced salary cap. The England vice-captain, Courtney Lawes, who is understood to have the option to leave Northampton at the end of the season, recently warned of the consequences for the national side of so many players suddenly becoming unavailable and Borthwick has revealed the issue is forming part of the discussions around the new Professional Game Agreement which comes into effect next year. Citing a meeting with the RFU last week, Jamie George insisted those discussions have been positive against the backdrop of the threat of strike action by the Wales squad, which put into doubt England’s Six Nations fixture in Cardiff on Saturday, but there is a growing sense that major overhaul is required to avoid England’s own player crisis with some Premiership clubs no longer considering it viable to house numerous internationals. While the RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has previously suggested a form of central contracts could be considered, that nuclear option is unlikely, but until Premiership clubs have the will and the means to retain England stars, greater flexibility over selection criteria would limit the damage to the national team. “What we are faced with here are some extreme circumstances,” said Borthwick, who has made one change to his side to face Wales with Anthony Watson selected on the left wing for a first start in almost two years. “There are discussions ongoing about what this means and what the implications are going forward. It’s about the players’ livelihoods and careers as well. From my point of view I want to make sure we are able to select the greatest number of players possible. And the best players possible. Do I want to make sure we have an England team where we have the best players available to us? Yes.” Borthwick expressed sympathy for the Wales squad, who agreed to remove the threat of industrial action after a compromise was reached with the Welsh Rugby Union over their demands. As a result, the 60-cap rule, which prevents players with fewer who are based outside Wales from being eligible, has been reduced to 25. Historically, the RFU has held firm over its ruling, which was introduced after the 2011 World Cup. Tom Palmer was eligible for the 2012 Six Nations because he was still contracted with Stade Francais but, barring the odd exception for Brad Shields and Piers Francis, who were about to join Premiership clubs, players such as Steffon Armitage have been repeatedly overlooked. But given the current landscape, Borthwick added: “There are negotiations for a new Professional Game Agreement, starting in 2024. Players have been involved in the early point of those discussions. From my point of view they are in the early stages but we do know there are issues in rugby right now. I and all our players sympathise wholeheartedly with what the Welsh players have had to go through. Nobody should have to go through the level of uncertainty they have had. “Everyone knows it’s been a challenging situation for rugby in this part of the world. We’ve seen two clubs no longer playing Premiership rugby this season. So we need to make sure those things are right. What we’re doing right now is focusing on putting on the best performance we can on Saturday.”"

                    "bodyText": "The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, clashed with Chinese diplomats on Thursday, passionately rejecting their claim that the west was adding fuel to the fire by arming Ukraine. Baerbock said it was time for China to tell Russia to stop its aggression. In a debate at the UN general assembly marking the anniversary of the invasion and seen as a key barometer of the state of world opinion, China intervened to present itself as above the conflict by proposing a catalogue of measures: a ceasefire, dialogue, security guarantees for Russia, protection of civilians and the upholding of territorial integrity. The deputy Chinese envoy to the UN, Dai Bing, insisted the west was worsening the situation by arming Ukraine, saying: “Adding fuel to the fire will only exacerbate tensions”. His remarks provoked Baerbock into a powerful rebuttal rejecting his claim that the west was indulging in military spending at the expense of other priorities more important to ordinary people. She asked: “Why on earth would we do that?”, adding: “We did not want this war. We did not choose this war.” She said her government “would much rather focus every bit of our energy and money in fixing our schools, in fighting the climate crisis and strengthening social justice”, adding: “The truth is that if Russia stops fighting, the war will end, If Ukraine stops this fighting, Ukraine ends.” She said the suffering, including “abduction, rape and torture”, would continue every day, and that the world’s gaping wounds, caused by hunger, inflation and energy shortages, would not end. Every country, she argued, had a duty to send a clear signal that the war was coming to an end. Addressing the 30 to 40 countries likely to abstain from the resolution, including China, India and South Africa, she noted: “Today each of us has to make a decision to stand in isolation with the oppressor or stand together for peace.” She said there was a peace plan for Ukraine, and it was called the UN charter with its principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity and the non-use of force. “Every single one of us today has the opportunity to contribute to this peace plan by telling the aggressor to stop”. With Iran again saying it will abstain, it looks as if Russia will gain support, as opposed to an abstention, only from Nicaragua, North Korea, Syria and Belarus. Last time a comparable vote was held 35 states abstained, including 18 in Africa. The debate was dominated by European voices, with few of the African nations planning to abstain coming forward to explain their thinking. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, appealed directly to the likely abstainers, saying the war was “everyone’s business” and stressing: “Neutrality can amount to complicity with the aggressor.” She said our common duty was to stop to excessive violence, adding: “None of would be able to sleep easy in a world when a great power can at its own discretion attack its neighbours.”"

                    "headline": "Defence review at risk of delay amid funding row",
                    "bodyText": "A planned refresh of the government’s integrated review of defence and foreign policy is at risk of being delayed until after the budget in mid-March amid a row over funding and a lack of clarity over its aims. It had been expected that the fresh look at Britain’s geopolitical strategy, originally announced by Liz Truss and inherited by Rishi Sunak, would be released on 7 March – more than a week before the 15 March annual financial statement. Although the original integrated review was published as recently as 2021, the war in Ukraine has upended traditional military and diplomatic assumptions, reinforcing Russia’s status as a chronic threat and demonstrating a need for emergency investment, partly to replace equipment given to Kyiv. A report on Wednesday by Politico suggested that the document could be delayed into late March amid complaints that the submissions from the military were unimaginative, at a time when Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, is seeking an extra £8bn to £11bn in funding from the Treasury over the next two years. Neither Downing Street nor the Ministry of Defence would deny that the publication of the refresh had been set back; instead both said the overall aim of publishing the report in the early part of the year was unchanged. “The Integrated Review Refresh is on track to be published in the spring as planned,” No10 said on Thursday, while defence sources emphasised that “no date [for publication] has ever been confirmed”. On Thursday, Wallace publicly indicated he wanted more money from the Treasury, despite criticism that key contracts have been delayed, such as the new Ajax armoured vehicle, which is five years behind schedule. “85% of our contracts are on time and on budget,” the minister said. “When I say, look, I would like some more funding, whether now or the next comprehensive spending review in two years’ time, you’re dealing with someone who … this year, for the third time, delivered a balanced budget,” Wallace added. This year, however, an extra £3.7bn was quietly added to the defence capital budget by the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, during the November autumn statement, to plug a gap caused by the costs of the war, rising inflation and other factors. The minister also hit back at veterans minister Johnny Mercer, who had a day earlier said “it is obviously not credible to say that the money has been taken out of defence”, because of a previously announced increase of £24bn over four years, dating back to when Boris Johnson was prime minister. In reply, Wallace said: “Johnny is a junior minister. And Johnny luckily doesn’t have to run the budget. I have a defence budget that has to deal, like all the other budgets, with inflation, with changes to threat, and I have to just deal with that. And that’s my job.” Defence reviews are normally closely linked to budget settlements, because the cost of running Britain’s armed forces is such that service heads want clarity as to how much they can in theory spend to meet political goals. The army is particularly unhappy that it has borne the brunt of helping Ukraine, while there have been relatively little demands made of the navy and air force. In January, when the government announced it would supply 14 Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, the head of the army, warned: “Giving away these capabilities will leave us temporarily weaker as an army, there is no denying it.” Johnson’s £24bn four-year uplift was announced in November 2020, four months before the integrated review itself was announced. Its key points were to lift the cap on nuclear warheads and an “Indo-Pacific tilt” in which the UK deepens ties with India, Japan, South Korea and Australia in opposition to China. However, this cash uplift was rapidly eroded by high inflation and the need to plug black holes in capital spending."

                    "bodyText": "After the new chief executive Tufan Erginbilgic’s dramatic description of Rolls-Royce as “a burning platform”, the actual numbers for 2022 were almost encouraging – or, at least, better than forecast. In place of the previously promised “modest” positive cashflow, Derby’s finest engine-maker produced £505m, which is not small change even in the context of a group of this size. Meanwhile, commercial aircraft are flying again, especially in China, which is critical for Rolls-Royce. And it is obviously a good moment to own a business in the defence sector. With the share price surging by a fifth on Thursday, one can reasonably ask why Erginbilgic felt the need to ramp up the rhetoric. Shouldn’t he have spent more time giving thanks for the efforts of his predecessor, Warren East, who genuinely had to reach for the fire hoses when the pandemic savaged Rolls’s revenues from servicing engines? Erginbilgic’s answer on that point was twofold. First, he was trying to gee up the workforce. Fair enough – that’s the prerogative of a new boss. Second, and more pertinently, Rolls’s financial performance is still a shocker if you take the long view. On that score, he is undoubtedly correct. Nobody had a good time in the pandemic but not every rival produced a five-year shareholder return of minus 67%. And an average annual return on capital of 4%-ish is a road to ruin if, like Rolls, you are borrowing in debt that still isn’t ranked as investment grade. So, yes, a full toot on the transformation trumpet was in order. The aim is “materially higher profit, cashflows and returns”. The tricky bit is making it happen. The insight that Rolls is “capable of much more” is hardly novel. Go back to East’s opening pitch on arrival in 2015, a period after a string of profits warnings, and you’ll find similar plain-speaking refrains. The talk then was about making “fundamental changes” to the company’s way of working and injecting “greater pace and accountability to decision making”. Erginbilgic’s seven “workstreams” towards self-improvement don’t sound markedly different in spirit. It’s fine, for example, to say you want to improve “commercial optimisation” and be rewarded properly for “the value we create for customers”, but who doesn’t? Those same customers, one assumes, will also be keenly aware of their negotiating clout. In a similar vein, the goal of delivering “a significant and structural” reduction in working capital has been heard before at Rolls. If there’s a difference in Erginbilgic’s approach, it’s the promise to make the strategy “granular”. There may also be a certain new ruthlessness about chopping programmes with marginal paybacks. The UK government, for example, should take note of the demand to actually commit to a funding model for small, modular nuclear reactors, a business that excited East. Yet the ambition will only start to feel real when Erginbilgic issues hard targets of Rolls’s financial ambitions and puts a few numbers of what he thinks is achievable. That moment is promised for the second half of this year and is the critical first stage of this latest reinvention effort. He’s not there yet. The good news for shareholders is that gentler breezes are blowing through the aerospace business, where the civil side represents 45% of Rolls’s group revenues of £12.7bn. The moment of maximum danger from pandemic fallout has clearly passed if the forecast proves correct that engine flying hours in 2023 will be 80%-90% of 2019 levels. But investors could, for the time being, contain their enthusiasm for the idea that Rolls can move seamlessly to a higher glide path. The aerospace business remains capital-intensive and volatile; and net zero would seem to carry as many threats as opportunities. A sweeping review of operations is justified at this juncture and Erginbilgic is saying the right things – but he’s not the first to promise that the future will be better."

                    "bodyText": "Russian forces have stepped up attacks along the eastern frontline of the war in Ukraine as Kyiv prepares to mark the sombre first anniversary of the invasion. Amid fears that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, intends to mark the anniversary with fresh attacks on key cities, Ukraine’s general staff said it had repelled 90 assaults in the east and north-east in the past 24 hours. Russia has fired 5,000 missiles at Ukraine and carried out almost 3,500 airstrikes, according to Ukraine’s general staff. The UN’s general assembly is expected to vote on a motion calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. The 193-member assembly is expected by a massive majority to endorse the broad resolution, but China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain. UN secretary general António Guterres condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “an affront to our collective conscience” at a two-day meeting of the general assembly. Friday’s anniversary is “a grim milestone for the people of Ukraine and for the international community”, he said in New York. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he had not seen any Chinese peace plan but he would welcome a meeting between Ukraine and China. “We would like to meet with China,” he said during a news briefing in Kyiv with the visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, on the eve of the first anniversary the invasion. Sánchez, meanwhile, said: “I’m back in Ukraine a year after the start of the war. We will stay by Ukraine’s side until peace returns to Europe.” Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said the alliance had seen signs that China was considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against taking any such step. The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has warned China that providing any material support to Russia’s war effort would be “a very serious concern”. “We will certainly continue to make clear to the Chinese government and to companies and banks in their jurisdictions what the rules are regarding our sanctions and the serious consequences that they would face in violating them,” she told reporters in India. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, met Putin in Moscow on Wednesday, as China and Russia reaffirmed their close bilateral relationship. Wang told Putin that Beijing would play a “constructive” role in reaching a political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine, Russian state-owned Tass news agency reported. Earlier on Wednesday, Wang met Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, where he said he expected to reach a “new consensus” on advancing the relationship between the two allies. Xi Jinping, China’s president, is expected to visit Putin in Russia in the coming months. The Biden administration is considering releasing intelligence it believes shows that China is weighing whether to supply weapons to Russia, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Putin has said Russia will deploy its new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, nicknamed “Satan 2”, as well as introduce hypersonic missiles and new nuclear submarines. In an address to mark the Defender of the Fatherland holiday on Thursday, Putin said Russia would “pay increased attention” to boost its nuclear forces on land, sea and in the air. Joe Biden has said Putin made a “big mistake” by suspending the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US. Russia’s decision to suspend its participation in the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty with the US would not increase the risk of a nuclear war, Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said. Russia’s parliament on Wednesday approved suspending the treaty. Putin has praised soldiers who are “fighting heroically, courageously, bravely” to “defend the fatherland” in a speech at a rally in Moscow on Wednesday to mark a year of war in Ukraine. Thousands of people gathered at Luzhniki stadium in Moscow to attend a concert marking the Defender of the Fatherland day. The founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has said much-needed ammunition for his troops has been dispatched, after a public row in which he accused the military leadership of treason. In an audio clip on Thursday, Prigozhin said he felt the pressure he and others had put on the defence ministry had paid off, and he had been told that ammunition was on its way. The sanctions introduced by G7 nations against Russia since its invasion of Ukraine should be applied by all G20 countries, Italy’s economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, has said. Giorgetti said the sanctions “must be applied not only by the G7 countries but also by the G20 countries”. EU countries have failed to agree on a new set of sanctions against Russia meant to be in place for the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, four diplomatic sources in Brussels told Reuters on Wednesday. More talks among Brussels representatives of EU member countries were due on Thursday afternoon, said the sources. Australia will send drones to Ukraine and expand sanctions against Russian government, military and media figures as part of a pledge to stand with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. The package includes travel bans and asset freezes for a further 90 Russian individuals and 40 Russian entities, including the state-owned media outlet Sputnik. Finland will send three Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, the country’s defence ministry has said. The announcement comes after Sweden’s defence minister said it was open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks. The Czech government has also announced a further military aid shipment to Ukraine. Britain has begun to “warm up” its production lines to replace weapons sent to Ukraine and increase production of artillery shells to try to help Kyiv push back Russian forces, defence minister Ben Wallace has said. In an interview with Reuters, Wallace said he believed Britain was in a good place to help Ukraine but needed to sustain the provision of weapons. A Russian fighter plane crashed on Thursday and the pilot was killed in Russia’s Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine. The cause of the crash was a “technical malfunction”, according to preliminary information, the Russian state-run Tass news agency cited the ministry as saying. The plane crashed in an uninhabited area and there were no reports of other damage, it said. Moldova has dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry that Ukraine planned to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria after staging a false-flag operation, and called for calm. The Russian ministry said Ukraine planned to stage an attack purportedly by Russian forces from Transnistria as a pretext for the invasion, state media reported. Ukrainian courts have brought charges against nearly 300 people for war crimes since Russia’s invasion a year ago, an official has said. Ukraine’s prosecutor coordinating war crimes cases in The Hague, Myroslava Krasnoborova, said 26 individuals had been tried and convicted and in all 276 people had been charged with war crimes. The Kerch Bridge, which connects mainland Russia to the occupied Crimean peninsula, has reopened to road traffic, the deputy prime minister, Marat Khusnullin, has announced. The bridge, which has served as a vital transport link for carrying military equipment to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, was partially destroyed by a blast in October. A Russian man who has lived in Poland for many years has been charged with spying, Polish authorities said. The suspect was detained in April on suspicion of collecting information between 2015 and April 2022 concerning the military readiness of Poland’s armed forces and of Nato, and passing them on to the Russian intelligence service. A series of cyber-attacks on Wednesday targeting Italian companies and public institutions, including the websites of the defence ministry and police, were “a threat, a warning” from Russia, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, has said. The attacks, which were claimed by the Russian group NoName057, came after Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni’s, visit to Ukraine this week. Two civilians have been killed in Russian shelling of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine on Wednesday, according to regional officials. Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the regional military administration, said an 81-year-old woman and a 68-year-old man were killed during shelling of the village of Novotyahinka, about 40 km (25 miles) from Kherson city. A Russian missile strike on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv on Wednesday morning has also left two civilians wounded, Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv region, has said. Biden vowed that the US will defend “literally every inch of Nato” territory ahead of talks with Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9), a collection of nations on the most eastern parts of the Nato alliance and closest to Russia. All members of the B9 have jointly condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine, a Polish presidential adviser said. Biden and the B9 leaders “reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine and underscored their shared commitment to stand with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes” according to a White House account of Wednesday afternoon’s meeting in Warsaw. Nato must “seriously plan” for the likely future reality of a Russian-controlled Belarus, the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has warned. Putin will “very likely secure significant gains in restoring Russian suzerainty over Belarus” and use it as a launch pad to further threaten Ukraine and Nato’s eastern flank, regardless of the outcome of his invasion of Ukraine, the ISW said in its latest update on the war. Ukraine will ask Turkey and the UN this week to start talks to roll over the Black Sea grain deal, seeking an extension of at least a year that would include the ports of Mykolaiv, a senior Ukrainian official said. A group of 10 EU member states have called for stronger action to stop Russia sourcing military parts through front companies in neighbouring countries and evading western sanctions. The 10 countries, which include France, Germany, Italy and the Baltic states, write that “2023 must be the year of success in countering circumvention”, warning that public support and international legitimacy of sanctions could wane if they are deemed ineffective. Women in Ukraine are increasingly vulnerable to sexual violence 12 months after Russia invaded the country, with reports of abuse on the rise, according to a leading humanitarian organisation in the country. Women fleeing from bombed houses and their home towns are reporting attacks occurring in the home and in communal shelters, said Marysia Zapasnik, Ukraine country director for the International Rescue Committee."

                    "bodyText": "Russian forces have stepped up attacks along the eastern frontline of the war in Ukraine as Kyiv prepares to mark the sombre first anniversary of the invasion. Amid fears that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, intends to mark the anniversary with fresh attacks on key cities, Ukraine’s general staff said it had repelled 90 assaults in the east and north-east in the past 24 hours. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday that his country would ultimately prevail in the war, which began on 24 February last year when Russian armoured vehicles poured over Ukraine’s borders and jets and missiles pummelled its cities. “We have not broken down, we have overcome many ordeals and we will prevail. We will hold to account all those who brought this evil, this war to our land,” Zelenskiy said on social media. According to the general staff update, Russia launched attacks near Kupiansk, in the eastern Kharkiv region, and Luhansk and Donetsk oblast, all places where Russian forces have been concentrating their offensive. There is no end in sight to the conflict, which in its first year has killed thousands in the fighting on both sides, displaced millions, reduced cities to rubble, and left large areas of Ukraine under Russian occupation. Russia has fired 5,000 missiles at Ukraine and carried out almost 3,500 airstrikes, according to Ukraine’s general staff. More than 7,000 Ukrainian civilians have been verified as killed, the UN commissioner for human rights has said, though the real number is believed to be much higher. The increase in the Russian offensives in the east, along the 600-mile frontline that runs from Kharkiv region down through the Donbas to the Russian-occupied south, comes amid Ukrainian fears that – at the very least – Moscow will mark the first year of the war by targeting its cities with missiles and kamikaze drones. Ukrainian officials have pointed to what they believe are recent efforts by Russian aerial reconnaissance vehicles – continuing on Thursday – to identify the location of Ukraine’s air defences. They believe those efforts may be the prelude to another mass rocket attack. Such attacks have been happening since the early autumn, although with diminishing effect. While some people are understood to have left Kyiv for the anniversary, others took the view that Russia had done its worst in terms of missile attacks. Among those was the military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, who told local media he did not believe Russia had the capacity to make more than a symbolic gesture either later on Thursday or on Friday. “Russia’s not planning anything extraordinary as far as attacks tomorrow,” he told Ukraine Pravda, adding he did not believe they had either enough missiles or new tactics to make a significant impact. “Nothing unusual will happen. A small missile strike [maybe]. We’ve experienced this more than 20 times before.” Budanov also suggested that he believed that far from trying to prolong the war, as some analysts have suggested, Russian generals were under pressure to deliver a limited victory in Donbas in the coming months. For weeks Russia has been intensifying its push to capture all of Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, collectively known as Donbas. Kyiv and its western allies say Moscow could try to launch a wider, more ambitious attack. Recent Russian efforts have, however, been marked by large losses on the Russian side as troops and vehicles are thrown at the Ukrainian defences in an apparent attempt to overwhelm by sheer weight of numbers, irrespective of casualties. As the war grinds on, Ukraine is waiting for the delivery of battle tanks and other weapons pledged by the west for it to reclaim occupied areas. While Putin is determined to achieve his goals, Ukraine and its allies are standing firm on preventing Russia from ending up with any of its land. Experts warn that Europe’s largest conflict since the second world war could drag on for years, increasing the albeit remote possibility of a direct confrontation between Russia and Nato. With both sides using up ammunition at a rate unseen in decades, the Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said Russia had poured more troops and weapons into the Donbas and attacked other areas in an apparent attempt to distract Ukrainian forces. “Russia currently has the initiative and the advantage on the battlefield,” he said, noting Kyiv’s acute shortage of ammunition. Russia has relied on its massive arsenal, and boosted production of weapons and munitions, giving it a significant edge. While Ukrainian and western intelligence agencies have observed that Moscow is running out of precision missiles, it has plenty of old-style weapons. A wider Russian offensive beyond the Donbas could be a gamble for Moscow, which mobilised 300,000 reservists last autumn to bolster its forces. Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank in London, predicted any Russian offensive would fail, but said it could drain Ukraine’s resources and keep it from preparing its own large-scale counteroffensive. “The big question is how much damage does the Russian offensive do before it runs out of steam, because that will dictate the Ukrainian position,” he said. Observers see little prospect for talks. Both sides were “irreconcilable on their current positions”, Bronk said. He added that major Ukrainian battlefield successes this summer could fuel “significant political turmoil in Russia, because at that point, Putin’s own position within the leadership becomes very, very difficult to see as tenable”. At the same time, if Ukraine fails to reclaim more territory before Russia builds up its troops, it could lead to a “long-term stalemate and sort of a grinding attritional war that just kind of goes on and on,” Bronk said, which would play into Moscow’s plan “to prolong the war and just wait for the west to get exhausted”.
