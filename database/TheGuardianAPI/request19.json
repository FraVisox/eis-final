Here’s how the two big parties stand on some of the key upcoming environmental issues, from crunch UN climate negotiations and how and whether the UK should frack, to what to do about the country’s energy inefficient homes and whether the government should keep killing badgers. Climate change David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have signed a cross-party pledge on climate action, but the issue is still approached differently by the parties. Labour leader Miliband has been forthright in placing climate change on the party’s agenda. In an op-ed in the Observer last week, he said climate change was a key economic issue for the UK and attacked Tory MPs who he said “flirt with climate change denial”. Miliband’s shadow energy and climate change minister Jonathan Reynolds told an audience in London last week: “I look at the Conservative party front bench and I do not see anyone coming through who takes this agenda seriously, who wants to develop ideas on it ... To me, the Conservative party, having had that phase where it looked like it was going to embrace this agenda, has fundamentally moved away from it and that is a great shame indeed.” But Greg Barker, Cameron’s climate envoy who was also on the panel, disagreed: “There are lots of green Tories.” When pressed for names Barker was able to cite just one example – Matt Hancock a minister for business, enterprise and energy – before saying: “The most important green Tory is David Cameron and he has consistently been my greatest ally in government.” But Cameron’s rhetoric on climate change has been undermined by his elevation of prominent climate sceptics to influential positions within the government’s environmental departments. The nadir was the much-lambasted and summarily-ended tenure of Owen Paterson as environment secretary, who has called climate science “consistently and widely exaggerated”. Michael Fallon who was a minister for climate change has also questioned climate science. These appointments represent an undercurrent of scepticism in the Conservative party. Last year a poll found just 30% of Tory MPs accepted it was “now an established scientific fact that climate change is largely man-made”. The election will also decide who represents the UK at the defining climate conference in Paris this December. Labour has employed former deputy PM John Prescott, who led the UK’s delegation on the Kyoto protocol, and it can be expected that he would take a lead role in any negotiations. Liberal Democrat secretary of energy and climate change Ed Davey, who has been the UK’s lead in climate talks, will need a hung parliament and a new coalition deal to see the job through to Paris. Should the Tories win government outright, Barker, may retain an active role despite his imminent retirement from politics. Carbon budgets More contentious than the need for action, will be the question of how Britain achieves decarbonisation. In order to chart a way to its goal of 80% emissions reductions from 1990 levels by 2050, the UK has defined how much carbon it can burn in five yearly periods from 2008 until 2028. These are known as the carbon budgets. In December 2015, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) will advise on Britain’s emissions reductions between 2028 and 2032 – the fifth carbon budget. Under the law, the sitting government must accept this advice and implement policies to achieve the reductions. All parties agree unabated coal power must be eradicated and have committed to phasing it out – although any new parliament will not have to do much to make this happen as anti-pollution laws and carbon pricing will see all stations closed by 2027. Chairman of the CCC John Gummer says, with coal heading for oblivion by the time its term begins, the fifth carbon budget will be the toughest to legislate. “Whoever is in power, there will be tough discussion about how we do that because the fifth carbon budget is going to be very difficult indeed in the sense that we’ll have picked off a lot of the low hanging fruit.” Clean energy: onshore wind and nuclear Labour and the Conservatives largely agree that Britain’s low-carbon future involves a broad suite of energy sources, including renewable technologies, nuclear and potentially domestic shale gas. But how much of each and their enthusiasm for certain technologies varies significantly. “No doubt there is greater appetite for the nuclear component and a lesser appetite for onshore wind among Conservatives and a smaller appetite for the nuclear component in the Labour party,” says Gummer. The Tories are openly hostile to onshore wind and various MPs have fanned the flames of public nimbyism by calling it a “blight” on landscapes and consistently rejecting planning applications. If it wins in May, the party has committed to cutting subsidies to the sector – Britain’s largest source of renewable energy – a move renewables groups say would “kill the industry dead”. This is despite onshore wind’s increasing affordability, reflected in the prices offered in Thursday’s government auction for new project contracts. Jim Watson, research director of the UK Energy Research Centre, says the Tories’ opposition to certain forms of renewables runs counter to the interests of taxpayers. “If we want to reduce the costs of meeting our climate targets we ought to be enabling the lower cost technologies to come through and be built to save people money. It seems odd to me that a politician of whatever party would want to stand in the way of a technology that lowers the cost of meeting our climate targets for consumers.” Financial support for the £25bn nuclear behemoth at Hinkley Point C, which was born of a pro-nuclear policy under the last Labour government, was announced by the current administration in 2013. This is a key plank of the Conservative’s decarbonisation plan and the defining infrastructure announcement of Davey’s term as energy and climate change secretary. But it looks likely to be delayed by shareholder setbacks and legal challenges to its generous subsidy regime. Labour has offered its support for the Hinkley project. “It will be interesting how much [Labour] pursue a pro-renewables versus a pro-all-of-the-above strategy,” says Green Alliance’s head of politics Alastair Harper. Miliband has expressed tentative support for onshore wind. But Harper says the issue could be politically divisive. “Are they going to go all out and say onshore wind has a real future in the UK if you vote for us? They haven’t quite done that yet and it’d be an interesting binary moment for them to go for.” By the time the fifth carbon budget is announced in December, says Gummer, whichever party (or parties) is in government may have had the argument settled for them. “The price of renewables is falling much more sharply than even the most optimistic would have said and the situation of nuclear is of course still not certain with the delay on the next stage of Hinkley [Point C nuclear power station]”. Fracking The issue of shale gas exploration, or fracking, will be another key decision during the planning of the fifth carbon budget, says Watson. “How much gas we can burn in the context of our targets and what is the role of shale gas within that will certainly come up, for whatever government is in power,” he says. Both the Conservatives and Labour have expressed enthusiasm for fracking and claim credit for creating a safe, attractive legal platform for the industry – although there is a distinct difference in their approach. The Tories have aggressively pursued an agenda that removes regulatory hurdles. Some of which Labour has opposed, including fracking beneath national parks and beside aquifers. “You’re really talking about difference of emphasis,” says Watson. “But there really isn’t a clear difference of one party is really for it and one party is really against it. I just detect a more cautious approach from Labour. There isn’t the same sort of rhetoric that there is from some government ministers.” Watson says some less-straightforward electoral outcomes could influence the politics of fracking during the next term. Scotland has implemented a moratorium on fracking. Watson raises the possibility that a Labour-Scottish National party coalition (a possibility being hawked by the Tories) may have a more adversarial attitude towards shale gas. The Welsh government is investigating its legal options to implement such a ban. The national Labour party has committed to devolving powers to Wales to allow them to ban fracking. Animal welfare Badgers and foxes are perhaps the only environmental issues where daylight exists between the Tories and Labour. Should the Conservatives win in May, they will allow a free vote on repealing the Hunting Act, which bans hunting with dogs. They will also continue and expand the badger cull. Labour stands opposed to both these policies. There is massive public opposition to both the badger cull (42% against, 36% for) and fox hunting (80% against). So why are the Tories swimming against the flow? These debates hark back to the days before the UK’s politics became a bland amble to the centre. They are based on ancient rivalries between the country and the city, a small group of landowning toffs versus the renting class. But most importantly, they are politically irrelevant. “It’s very easy for the parties to hold those different positions because they speak to different audiences that don’t really cross over ... It’s very easy to get off the fence both ways,” says Harper. Few people will decide their vote on animal welfare issues. The Tories might grab a few votes from Ukip in rural areas and Labour from the Greens, but the floating centre has more pressing concerns. Energy efficiency The coalition government’s flagship energy efficiency scheme, the green deal, has become a traumatic experience for its architects. Despite recent successes in some aspects of the grants-for-home-improvements scheme, the overall take-up has been disappointing. This has left the UK’s desperately needed drive for household energy efficiency languishing. The Conservatives are yet to outline exactly how they will approach this tainted issue in the next parliament. Harper suggests it is a case of once bitten, twice shy. “I think the Tories feel burnt by the green deal and they haven’t really come up with how they’d deal with it. I’d be interested to see what’s in the manifesto on that. At the moment it just feels like they are still amazed that it didn’t work,” he says. Labour on the other hand, smelling electoral blood in the water, has pre-emptively announced an interest-free loan scheme that will replace the green deal grants. As part of a five-part efficiency strategy, Labour says the loans will improve up to one million homes during the next parliament. But the Green Building Council has warned that Labour may have to further sweeten the deal in order to motivate homeowners. Nature Nature is the thorn in the free market’s side, that pesky “externality” that the UK’s major parties don’t really know what to do about. So on the whole, they ignore it. “The thing that is absent from the narrative of both parties right now is a real vision for what they are going to do about nature. And how we’re going to stop the losing battle of our habitats and our local environment getting worse and worse with every passing year and for the last 50 years,” says Harper. “That conversation, that ambition hasn’t really been owned by either of the main parties. Their manifestos will have to address it in some way and I think what you’ll see is a lot of the big natural environment organisations, like the RSPB and the Wildlife Trusts and so on, will be pushing for ... clear legislative plans to restore nature at a national level.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/mar/07/nuclear-power-cost-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-07T18:00:00Z","webTitle":"Why taxpayers serve nuclear power and not the other way around","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/mar/07/nuclear-power-cost-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/mar/07/nuclear-power-cost-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"Why taxpayers serve nuclear power and not the other way around","bodyText":"\"It would be ideal if Fukushima could steer us away from prophecies and towards a sensible assessment of market economics, climate science and nuclear risks. Then nuclear power would serve the public, not the other way around. I don't know how many reactors we would get, but we would get the number that we need.\" In the fiendishly complex debate on the merits of nuclear power, that analysis is the most clear-eyed and crisply expressed that I have seen. It comes from nuclear industry veteran and academic Peter Bradford and is published in the leading journal Nature. I'll make no apology from quoting from his article liberally. On 11 March, it will be one year since the enormous earthquake and tsunami, which killed at least 16,000 people and caused a catastrophic meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. The impact on nuclear power has been profound and the anniversary is a good time to reflect on what role the technology has to play in delivering low-carbon, secure energy at reasonable cost. The \"prophecies\" Bradford rails against are statements made with \"great certainty\" about the \"unknowable or implausible\". He gives examples from all sides of the debate: Germany has declared that existing nuclear capacity is too dangerous and can be phased out at little cost. The Middle East and the Czech Republic assert that new nuclear is a vital low-carbon energy source. Others, including the United Kingdom, have said that there will soon be new nuclear without subsidies. Let's tackle the last example first, as it's closest to home for me. Bradford again makes the point crisply. The UK government is now having to torture the language of new policies to subsidise new reactors without this being recognised as such. That contortion, the result of a coalition between two parties with opposing views on nuclear power, alongside the fallout from Fukushima appears to have heavily dented UK public confidence. A new Guardian/ICM poll shows that in February 2012, 61% of people said they would be strongly opposed to a new nuclear power station being built near their home, compared to 39% in early 2010 (though other polls should be noted). The question of subsidies is central to Bradford's analysis: The most implacable enemy of nuclear power in the past 30 years has been the risk not to public health, but to investors' wallets. No new nuclear-power project has ever bid successfully in a competitive energy market anywhere in the world. That's pretty damning and explains Bradford's next point: big nuclear programmes only happen when citizens sign blank cheques. At the time of the Fukushima disaster, only four countries (China, Russia, India and South Korea) were building more than two reactors. In these four nations, citizens pay for the new reactors the government chooses to build through direct subsidies or energy price hikes. A rare exception to this is the Olkiluoto 3 reactor under construction in Finland, by French-state owned company Areva, which is also hoping to build new plants in the UK. Bradford explains: Areva was gambling that the project would jump-start demand for its newest reactor design. As Olkiluoto is four years behind schedule and more than €2 billion ($2.7 billion) over budget, that gamble has fallen flat. The bind for nuclear, argues Bradford, is that gas is likely to be a lot cheaper than new nuclear unless there is a high price on carbon, which there needs to be to tackle climate change. But if the carbon price is high, \"there are many other alternatives that could be built on a large scale more quickly\", he says, such as energy efficiency, wind power and switching from coal to gas. The solution, Bradford argues, is simply to let nuclear energy earn its place: Wise economic and environmental policy will have to allow nuclear energy whatever place it can earn among other energy sources, and not burden it with unnecessary hopes and fears ... All greenhouse-gas mitigating measures and alternative-energy sources should have to compete with each other in the marketplace. Here is a rare point where I don't fully agree with Bradford. Is it really possible to have true competition when nuclear power carries the small but inherent risk of a major disaster that only a state and its taxpayers could cope with? Bradford notes the paradox in the land of the free market, the US, where: the right-wing legislators who swept into state and federal office in 2010 have conflicting tendencies towards nuclear energy: they are largely pro-nuclear, pro-market, climate-change sceptics, yet they disparage governmental backing of particular technologies with taxpayers' money. The first licence to build new reactors in the US since 1978 was granted on 9 February. These will be sited in Georgia, which Bradford notes, is \"one of the few states with a law assuring that energy customers will pay all reactor costs regardless of price.\" The US is also one of only three countries in which a majority of the public supported nuclear power in a poll across 224 countries in June 2011. Given that virtually all the thinking in this post has come from Bradford, I will give him the last word: Buffeted by economic forces, new nuclear capacity cannot be expected to contribute significantly to global energy supplies or to climate-policy solutions in the decades ahead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/30/horizon-nuclear-energy-ccs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-30T14:13:47Z","webTitle":"Nuclear sale overshadows crucial carbon capture development | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/30/horizon-nuclear-energy-ccs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/30/horizon-nuclear-energy-ccs","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear sale overshadows crucial carbon capture development","bodyText":"There are two four-letter words that sum up today's announcement that Hitachi is buying the Horizon nuclear power business abandoned by German-owned RWE and E.on after the Fukushima disaster led Angela Merkel to turn her back on building new reactors. The first is \"phew\", the overwhelming sentiment from ministers and from Horizon's former owners. For ministers, the big hole in their low-carbon energy plans that would be left by a failure to get new nuclear plants built is now less likely, For RWE and E.on, they have offloaded the nuclear sites for a lot more cash - £700m - than they might have expected. The fact that even EDF, a supposed competitor to Horizon, \"welcomed\" Hitachi's purchase shows how close to meltdown the plan to build new nuclear plants has come. The second four-letter word, from those who oppose new nuclear power in the UK, is unprintable. Hitachi's purchase is undoubtedly a blow for them. But despite the government's delight – Prime minister David Cameron was rolled out to herald the news – today's development is a small step on a long road. The second energy announcement today, the shortlisting of four carbon capture and storage projects in the government's £1bn competition, could be the more significant news. It now looks likely that contracts for one or two CCS demonstrations will be signed within a year. That's very welcome given the government's current emphasis on gas, because that means CCS is going to be needed. But the prospect of new reactors at Horizon's sites at Wylfa on Anglesey and Oldbury in Gloucestershire remains much more distant. Cameron said: \"This is a decades-long, multi-billion pound vote of confidence in the UK,\" But what Hitachi has bought, whatever it says about \"a 100 year commitment\", is an option, nothing more. For its £700m, it now has sites with permission build two or three reactors on each. That is lot of money, but its probably less than 1% of the total value of running six reactors for 60 years. Before it does so, it needs to get its nuclear technology licensed in the UK: that can take years. Next, it has to finance tens of billions of pounds of investment to build the new plants. That will of course depend on what price the government decides to guarantee for electricity from new nuclear power. French state-controlled EDF is leading that crucial negotiation, which is the subject of intense speculation. The best guess for what EDF is demanding is high - probably between £100 and £140 per MWh, comparable to offshore wind. The question is whether ministers are prepared to commit energy customers to paying that for decades. It is notable that, despite half a century of taxpayer subsidies, the cost of nuclear energy is rising, while the cost of energy from the much younger renewable sector is falling. But do not underestimate the government's attachment to the nuclear project. You'd be forgiven for thinking the energy ministry had been entirely captured by the nuclear industry with, as I reported a year ago, several EDF staff working on secondment in government and civil servants returning the favour by working for the energy companies, including Horizon. There was more today, with the announcement of a new Nuclear Industry Council. The Nuclear Industry Association's chairman John Hutton said: \"The new council symbolises the long-term strategic partnership developing between the UK nuclear industry and the government.\" It certainly does. There is no Renewable Industry Council or any renewable energy industry staff on secondment in the department for energy and climate change (Decc). The CCS news is thankfully more straightforward, and allows the five-year fiasco of the previous CCS competition to be buried. In many scenarios CCS is crucial to meeting future carbon targets and even more so should new nuclear falter. Minister's shortlisted the four projects in seven months and those chosen wisely span the range of CCS technology. Only one is on a gas plant, with the other three on coal power stations. That is unfortunate, given the government's current \"dash for gas\", says Prof Stuart Haszeldine, a CCS expert at University of Edinburgh, but results from a historical focus in coal. One surprise was the failure of 2Co Energy's Don Valley CCS project to wind government support, given that it was seen to be the most advanced and most favoured by the EU for potential matched funding. But Haszeldine said there were \"sensible\" reasons for the decision, including the lack of permission for a 50km onshore pipeline. The coalition is committed to supporting four commercial-scale CCS projects, but this competition won't support more than two. Haszeldine says splitting the £1bn pledged by government between a pair of projects \"would just about work\". He adds: \"There is now a six-week period to do the commercial bit. It's about Decc knocking heads together to see if the companies can improve the commercial terms of the deals by co-operating\" on, for example, shared pipelines. In a decade or two's time, I wonder which of today's two announcements - nuclear and CCS - will have been more significant: a renaissance for an old industry or the flowering of a new one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2013/dec/05/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-05T21:00:02Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/dec/05/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2013/dec/05/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• The print version of an article about the cleanup operation at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which suffered catastrophic damage when it was hit by a tsunami in March 2011 (A dirty job with no end in sight, 4 December, page 6, G2), referred to \"the independent Nuclear Reform Monitoring Committee\".

Thank you very much for your letter, I was very happy when I opened it. How are you? Me, I am fine but a little tired. I am tired because I have a lot of lessons. I am excite about meeting with you.\" It was a week after receiving this letter that I met the person who would turn out to become my best friend. Juliette and I met seven years ago through the foreign exchange organised by our schools. We started as pen friends – the old-fashioned ink and paper kind. The letters we wrote introduced us to each other – and a new language. I wrote in French, she wrote in English – with drawings scattered like commas throughout. Reading back through our letters gives an accurate account of what was on the curriculum at the time. \"What do you like to do in your spare time?\" \"Tell me about your local area\" and later (when I hit A-levels) \"What do you think about nuclear power?\" When we eventually met in person I felt like we were already friends. Our bond was sealed by singing loudly to Kaiser Chiefs – her on air guitar, me on air drums – in her house in France. There are some things that transcend language. I stayed with her family in Laval, and she came to Dorset to visit me. Over the years we stayed in touch and went back and forth to visit each other. Attending her school helped me get to grips with French. I remember how proud I felt on the few occasions I knew the answers to questions during her classes. As we got older going out gave me a quick dunk into a sea of new language. I remember talking to a police officer in French, while slightly inebriated, after my passport had been stolen in a bar. The passport was found, and so was a new confidence in my ability to solve problems in French. Juliette's friends teased me for my English accent (they still do). Spending time with them introduced me to verlang – the slang that swaps the beginning and end of words – very annoying for anyone only just getting to grips with a language, but something I now know to listen out for. Juliette has become part of my family. My mum calls her \"my French daughter\" and I'm pretty sure my friends like her more than they like me. Although we speak mainly on Facebook or Skype now, I've kept all of our letters. They are the physical representation of our friendship and language learning. Her handwriting looks like how she speaks – curving with the dips of her accent. My French is a little shaky since finishing my A-levels. Thanks to the French university system Juliette has been able to keep up language learning alongside her business degree; her English now puts my faltering French to shame. I visited her recently in Paris, where she now lives. Juliette has always been far more elegant than me, and now her English is just as sophisticated as the chic outfits she wears. Like all best friends, Juliette and I speak in a language of our own – we get each other even when we're using incorrect tenses or words that aren't words. But I am determined to improve my language. I want to be able to speak to her in her native language as easily as I do in English. I want to communicate fluently with her friends and family. It gives me a reason for learning French that makes unknotting irregular verbs seem worthwhile. When I left school I wrote to my French teacher to thank him for organising the school's exchange. I was pleased to hear recently that the French exchange at my old school is still running – and now has nearly 100 students involved. Apps and online courses are the latest trend, making pen pals and post feel like the leg warmers of language learning – dated. But we shouldn't overlook this unique method of discovering languages. It was through the foreign exchange and many letters that I met my best friend, and found a reason for learning a language."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jan/18/nuclear-power-public-support-opinion-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-18T08:30:00Z","webTitle":"Dip in nuclear power support after Fukushima proves shortlived | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jan/18/nuclear-power-public-support-opinion-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jan/18/nuclear-power-public-support-opinion-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"Dip in nuclear power support after Fukushima proves shortlived","bodyText":"The dip in public support for new nuclear power following the Fukushima disaster in Japan lasted no more than nine months in the UK, according to a new poll from Ipsos MORI, published here for the first time. Futhermore, looking at the trend over the last decade, acceptance of nuclear power shows a rising trend. Polls, even gold standard ones, can only tell you what people think, not why they hold those views, so let's look at the data first (you can get the full dataset here). The Fukushima catastrophe began on 11 March 2011 and the Ipsos MORI poll in June 2011 shows a clear dip in support for nuclear power. But by December 2011, support was back to where it was, allowing for the margin of error. A Populus poll in August 2011 also showed little change in support from the previous year, suggesting the dip may have been shorter than even five months. The new Ipsos MORI data also show a clear long term trend towards support for new replacement nuclear plants. (Note that in 2001 the question was slightly different, simply asking about support for any new nuclear, not just replacement plants.) Another question Ipsos MORI asked - how favourably or unfavourably do you view nuclear industry and nuclear energy? - shows the same pattern. People holding favourable opinions fell from 40% to 28% after Fukushima and then went back to 40% in the December poll. Unfavourable opinions were held by 17% before the accident, went up to 24%, then fell to 19%. There are some pretty big differences between ages, sexes and socio-economic groups in the December poll, too. While 62% of men support nuclear power, only 39% of women do the same. And while 36% of 16-24 year olds support the technology, 60% of all those over 55 do the same. Lastly, 68% of those in the wealthiest socio-economic group support nuclear, with only 38% of those in the DE group following suit. Robert Knight, director at the Ipsos MORI Reputation Centre, offers this opinion: \"After the body blow suffered by British public opinion following the Fukushima incident, support for nuclear newbuild has recovered robustly in just a few months. It seems the public see Japan as a long way away and memories are short, but concerns about the future security of energy supply closer to home are ongoing and persistent.\" That may very well be true, and I'd add that increasing awareness of the need to tackle global warming by cutting carbon emissions could help boost support for nuclear. But here are some other factors to consider. Nuclear power operators work extremely close with government in the UK - far too closely when it came to the public relations response to Fukushima. High-level employees of the nuclear energy companies are lent to government for free for years at a time. So it would not be that surprising if the official national support for nuclear power helped rebuild public confidence. The contrast with other countries where the state and nuclear industry are not so intimately entwined is stark. As I have argued before, I think new nuclear power for the UK is an unnecessary risk, primarily in terms of cost. There are plenty of credible future energy policies that avoid nuclear power and cost no more, so why run the risk of hugely expensive accidents and soaring waste disposal costs? A separate poll from November 2011, commissioned but tellingly not published by the Sunday Times, shows that solar and wind power are far more popular than nuclear power. It is clear that plenty of people in the UK are comfortable with the building of new nuclear power plants, especially older, wealthy men. That, incidentally, reminds me of a poll I commissioned in January 2011, which showed that climate change sceptics were overwhelmingly male, over 65 and likely to vote Conservative. But young people - those who will pick up the bill for new nuclear power - and poorer people - who spend far more of their income on energy - are far less certain.

Bradwell-on-Sea has been identified as a possible site to dump radioactive waste. \"Everybody was aghast when a local representative from the NDA stated that the possibility was being looked into,\" Brian Beale, a district councillor for Maldon, told the Essex Chronicle. \"To say this could happen when it had always been understood that Bradwell was not intended to be a site for waste, created uproar.\" Nuclear materials are already being stored at Bradwell, a former nuclear power station that closed in 2002 and is being decommissioned. The operating company, Magnox Electric, was fined £250,000 in 2009 for presiding over a radioactive leak that had gone undetected for 14 years. An NDA report has proposed that around 280 yellow boxes of intermediate level waste could be brought from other sites to be stored there until 2040 when a permanent repository should be built. The report also mentions Berkeley, in Gloucestershire, Trawsfynydd, in Gwynedd, and Hinkley Point, in Somerset, for possible storage. The government has long promised that the thorny question of how to store existing waste from Britain's old nuclear plants must be settled before new power plants such as the one proposed by EDF for Hinkley are constructed. The only location for waste is at Drigg, near Sellafield, in Cumbria, but that is only for low-level waste. Cumbria county council rejected a permanent dump for high-level waste near the Lake District. Attempts to start a debate about a waste repositary in Shepway, Kent ,were dropped after local opposition. Most waste is kept at nuclear plants around the country. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, said: \"The fact is that no one wants this stuff. Neither Essex, Kent, Cumbria or anywhere and yet the government wants to create more.

The great hulking behemoth that is America’s entertainment industry has watched first in bemusement, then scorn, and now fear and fury as the mighty Sony Pictures has been brought to its knees by an anonymous group of computer hackers acting – so says the FBI – at the behest of North Korea. The absurdities have been escalating almost as fast as the diplomatic and geopolitical stakes. This time last week, the country’s media echo chamber was still obsessing about the hurtful things that super-producer Scott Rudin had said in leaked emails about Angelina Jolie and the tasteless, racially tinged jokes about Barack Obama that Rudin exchanged with the co-chairman of Sony Pictures, Amy Pascal. Now, in the wake of Sony’s decision not to release The Interview in cinemas (though the company says it is seeking other ways to distribute it), the improbably low-brow buddy movie starring Seth Rogen and James Franco that has moved the North Korean regime to extraordinary anger, the company has been lambasted for capitulating to “cyber-terrorists” and failing to stand up for free speech. The White House has both rebuked Sony – Obama said at his year-end news conference on Friday the company had made a mistake – and talked of a “proportional response” to the North Koreans. In Hollywood, it has been an extraordinary season of fear and loathing. Sony has come under fire for being both too bold and not bold enough. On the one hand, it greenlit a movie depicting the assassination of Kim Jong-un, a living world leader, and continued to support it even after North Korea started describing the film over the summer as “an act of war” and “reckless US provocative insanity”. And, on the other, it decided not to release the film in any form after the hackers distributed a barely coherent email threatening 11 September-style mayhem at any venue that showed it. The company has been accused of appeasing the North Koreans in the same way that Neville Chamberlain appeased the Nazis, of mishandling the crisis from start to finish and – perhaps most seriously – of betraying its own employees through sloppy oversight of its computer systems. At least three groups of plaintiffs have filed class-action lawsuits accusing the company of failing to protect its confidential data, including medical records, bank details and social security numbers. Sony, for its part, has made a half-hearted attempt to blame the media, deploying a small army of lawyers and celebrities to accuse them of being accessories to a crime and fanning the flames. Even after the decision to pull The Interview, the prominent screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who has a project with Sony, claimed that “easily distracted members of the American press who chose gossip and schadenfreude-fuelled reporting” had given the “terrorists” exactly what they were looking for. It seems scarcely believable that all this has been triggered by a self-consciously sophomoric comedy which, according to the few critics who have seen advance screenings, is more concerned with penis jokes than geopolitics and plays the face-melting death of Kim strictly for laughs, much as the team behind South Park killed Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, in the 2004 puppet comedy Team America: World Police. Scarcely believable, too, is the blitheness with which Seth Rogen was talking about the crisis as recently as last Monday. “There was a moment,” he told the New York Times, “where they were like, ‘They threatened war over the movie … Would you consider not killing him?’ And we were like, ‘Nope.’” The damage, however, is indisputable. Sony’s entire corporate cupboard was laid bare: personnel files, emails, business plans, scripts and rough cuts of forthcoming movies. Swaths of data were erased from its servers altogether. It is being widely described as the largest corporate hack to date. The cancellation of The Interview means Sony writing off about $80m in production and marketing costs. The interruption to the company’s business and the mounting litigation could push the damage north of $1bn by some estimates. Meanwhile, the question haunting the rest of the entertainment industry is: who’s next? “Are they going to go after the next studio, because they can?” one former Hollywood executive, who has worked for Sony, worried. “What happens if the whole industry is threatened? The problem is not confined to Hollywood. It could go to the banks, or to critical infrastructure like air-traffic control systems or nuclear power plants. There are potentially deadly consequences.” Sony’s rivals have gone deathly quiet for fear of attracting undue attention. When a handful of independent cinemas said they wanted to screen Team America instead of The Interview as a form of free-speech solidarity this Christmas, the studio behind the older film, Paramount, hastily denied them permission. Only a few days ago, the other studios were hopeful that a delay in The Interview’s release date could mean more business for them over the holidays. Now the fear is that the very mention of a 9/11-style attack will depress box-office takings for everyone. Computer security experts, meanwhile, are said to be working around the clock – at Fox, Warner Brothers and Paramount, as well as Sony – to build up their corporate defences. The consensus is that no entertainment company has taken cyber-security seriously enough. Things are not thought to have improved much since 2007, when Sony’s head of information security, Jason Spaltro, gave a notorious interview in which he said it was a “valid business decision to accept the risk of a breach” and he wasn’t about to spent $10m to prevent a $1m leak. “Hollywood’s just not that on top of it,” one Sony Pictures employee who has worked at numerous other studios said. “People haven’t been very worried about these things. They are now.” To some older Hollywood hands, the Sony hack is the digital-age equivalent of another seminal moment, the Manson family murders of 1969, which claimed the life of a pregnant Sharon Tate and seven others. Back then, the beautiful people rushed to lock their previously open doors, moved into gated communities, flushed drugs down the toilet and hired security firms to manage guest lists at parties. Now, in 2014, everyone is backing up data, setting up password protection for sensitive documents, devising more secure passwords and hiring private data protection consultants – the one group guaranteed to make a killing from this crisis. In theory, Sony went through this before, following a hack of its PlayStation network in 2011. The company hired Phil Reitinger, a computer security expert who had worked for Microsoft and the US Department of Homeland Security, to overhaul its computer systems, build more secure firewalls, encrypt vital data and improve password practices. But the results, according to the Sony Pictures employee, have been hard to see. At the time of the hack on 24 November contracts, scripts and other vital documents remained unencrypted. Few if any Word files were password-protected. And while the company talked about doing so-called “penetration testing” – simulated attacks on the servers to test their strength – the hack suggests they were not effective. The hacked documents only confirm the impression of laxity. Among the stolen personnel and financial records are folders and documents marked “passwords”, containing lists of employee usernames, passwords, credit card numbers and other sensitive data. An email from the chief financial officer, David Hendler, to Sony Pictures chairman Michael Lynton shows the company experienced months of outages in the runup to the hack – outages caused by limited storage space, unstable software repairs and what Hendler described as “an unskilled support team”. Still, it remains unclear if Sony was targeted because it was easy to attack, or because the hackers – calling themselves the Guardians of Peace – were particularly sophisticated. Plenty of other questions remain. Many Hollywood insiders and computer experts are questioning the FBI’s finding of North Korean involvement and say an inside job by an ex-employee with a grudge – and an ability to mimic established North Korean hacking techniques – remains more likely. “It’s not hard to see that North Korea can do this,” the former Sony executive said. “But it’s hard to see how they’d know what to send to Gawker and BuzzFeed, how they’d be so savvy about creating maximum embarrassment for the company out of this vast trove of material.” Investigators have been poring over the Guardians of Peace communiques, puzzled by the fact that passages of perfectly coherent English are interspersed with lines like: “We will clearly show it to you… how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to.” That’s either a Korean leaning too heavily on Google Translate in a pinch, or a homegrown hacker with a wicked sense of humour. Either way, the Obama administration said the threat was not credible. Messages purporting to be from the Guardians of Peace in the past 48 hours have grown contradictory – one telling Sony it has suffered enough and can now release the movie, minus the death scene, and another threatening violence if trailers and other supporting material are not pulled off the internet immediately. The whole affair has wavered alarmingly between deadly seriousness and high farce, making critical judgments difficult or impossible – not that it has stopped the usual media darlings, everyone from Hollywood-haters to Washington foreign-policy hawks, from weighing in. Predictions range from a boardroom shakeup at Sony Pictures to the outbreak of world war three. The cultural critic Andrew O’Hehir got about as close to the heart of things as anyone. “The titans of America’s culture industry,” he wrote in the online magazine Salon, “have been revealed as stupid and calculating and driven by fear… We should have known that already, but maybe the reminder is useful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2014/mar/17/market-reaction-sanctions-crimea-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-17T19:02:50Z","webTitle":"Market reaction suggests sanctions over Crimea are slap on the wrist for Putin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/17/market-reaction-sanctions-crimea-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/17/market-reaction-sanctions-crimea-russia","fields":{"headline":"Market reaction suggests sanctions over Crimea are slap on the wrist for Putin","bodyText":"The reaction of the financial markets to the west's sanctions over Crimea spoke volumes. Up went the rouble and shares on the Moscow stock market, down went the price of crude oil. Conclusion: the steps announced by the US and the EU were seen as a slap on the wrist for Vladimir Putin, the very least that could be delivered without Barack Obama, Angela Merkel et al all losing face. True, the door was left open for a ratcheting up of sanctions in the event that the Kremlin continues to \"destabilise\" the situation in Ukraine. But this was a weaker response than the markets had been expecting, not just in the number of people targeted by sanctions (21), but in their second-rank status and the limited nature of the visa restrictions and asset freezes. Significantly, the west did not target Putin and his immediate entourage. Neither did the sanctions include the oligarchs who have their wealth salted away in London, New York and other financial centres in the west. Compared, for example, with the sanctions imposed on Iran – which have frozen oil assets, targeted exports of petroleum-related products and crippled the banking sector – the measures announced following the snap referendum in Crimea are mild. There are two possible explanations for this approach. The first is that the west thinks that a modest package of measures is the best way to defuse the crisis, and hopes that Putin will back down at the first whiff of grapeshot. The second is that there is no real appetite for a tougher approach: London and Manhattan are awash with Russian money; Germany's need for Russian gas is stronger than ever now that nuclear power is on its way out; the struggling French economy can ill-afford the loss of lucrative defence contracts with the Kremlin. Without doubt, the west could cause serious harm to what is already a shaky Russian economy. Growth slowed markedly during 2013 and is over-dependent on the oil and gas sector. Researchers at Capital Economics, a London-based consultancy firm, estimate that $50bn (£30bn) of private-sector money has flowed out of Russia since the start of 2014, and if this trend were to continue the economy would be pushed into recession. An escalation of the crisis in Ukraine carries real economic risks for Moscow, particularly if the west responds with export curbs and banking restrictions. As Iran has shown, sanctions work if they are stringent enough. That, though, is not the issue. The west's problem is that it cannot hurt Russia without hurting itself, and fears the consequences of the mutually assured destruction which might follow if the Kremlin were to order the tanks in. Over and above the lost contracts and the threats to energy supplies, Obama, Merkel, François Hollande and David Cameron are all acutely aware that a Russian invasion of the Ukraine could derail their fragile recoveries. Putin knows that too. Which is why the message from the west – these sanctions might not hurt you, but tougher sanctions would – will not have the Russian leader quaking in his boots."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/future-europe-utilities-business-model-ict","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-27T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Europe's utilities should embrace role in ICT and smart infrastructure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/future-europe-utilities-business-model-ict","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/future-europe-utilities-business-model-ict","fields":{"headline":"Europe's utilities should embrace role in ICT and smart infrastructure","bodyText":"The value of Europe's top 20 utilities has halved in the past six years and their credit ratings have been downgraded, despite a recent upward trend. The situation is most stark in Germany where the utilities, the traditional suppliers of power largely through their fossil-fuelled plants, were caught out by the surprise phase out of nuclear power, the sharp decrease in the cost of solar and the rise of renewable generation capacity. Earlier this month, Germany generated two thirds of its power from wind and solar. German utility CEO, Peter Terium, recently declared the situation the \"worst structural crisis in the history of energy supply\". So is there a future for these once mighty actors? There is – but it will require a massive change in their thinking and business model. Utilities must put themselves at the heart of what the German government, borrowing nomenclature from Silicon Valley, is calling Industry 4.0. This new stage of industrial development will be based on Information Communication Technology (ICT) – smart industry enabled by smart infrastructure. There will be resource efficiency gains from managing information flows, analysing data and managing the distribution of increasing amounts of renewable energy. Information, not energy, will be the driver. A key element of Industry 4.0, according to new research by Deutsche Bank, is the smart factory which controls fast-growing complexity while boosting production efficiency. In the smart factory there is direct communication between man, machine and resources. This could suit the new energy business. The utilities – with their advanced engineering capability, specialism in energy systems and close historical ties to transmission and distribution system operators and consumers – have an excellent opportunity to become smart infrastructure solution providers. And coincidentally, there are two main public goods that the utilities could provide in a smart way. The first is that, while transmission and electricity generation in many European countries becomes more flexible and suitable for renewables expansion, a lack of government incentives in many European countries has meant the distribution grid operators have few commercial reasons to modernise. Markets for flexibility need to be created that will provide those incentives. ICT can be used to balance demand and supply at the smaller distribution grid level which is a much more efficient way of doing it than further up the grid, providing net savings for end users. Thus the stability of the system and its efficiency would improve. The utilities could also create what have been termed \"virtual plants\" by aggregating swarms of smaller decentralised plants (ie wind and solar farms) into what the grid recognises as one. Already, the grids in countries like Denmark are managed so well that they can accommodate more than a 40% share of renewable electricity. When using ICT for modernising distribution grids, the share can even be higher. The second is that utilities could communicate with smart metres and appliances to manage their energy usage in accordance with \"time of use\" tariffs, allowing them to shift a share of peak demand to hours with lower load, reducing peak capacity. The utilities could become aggregators of data – challenging the ICT companies (for example Google's NEST, the US home automation company now selling its Learning Thermostat in Europe) who are their suppliers. This data can be fed back into the scheduling of energy plants and in turn improve distribution grid stability and balancing needs, and it can be used to offer energy efficiency services to end users. There are three value drivers associated with the increased application of ICT to smart infrastructure: greater flexibility and speed in responding to unforeseen developments, greater coordination between different actors in the energy system, and better flows of information improving efficiency. Utilities need not just become energy service companies. They can build up expertise in applying ICT solutions to become providers of more far-reaching infrastructure modernisation, utilising their close ties with households, industrial consumers and grid operators to create resilient, resource efficient, smart infrastructure to the benefit of all.

The sea is in his family's blood, he says. His octogenarian father began working on boats when he was 12, and only retired three years ago. But even if his health permits, Niitsuma knows he may never again get the chance to board his boat and head out into the Pacific in search of sole, whitebait, flounder and greenling. The greatest threat to Niitsuma's livelihood, and that of other fishermen in Hisanohama, a small fishing town 125 miles north-east of Tokyo, lies just up the coast at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The environment ministry recently announcement that 300 tonnes of contaminated groundwater from Fukushima Daiichi is still seeping over or around barriers into the Pacific every day, more than two years after it was struck by a tsunami in March 2011. Government officials said they suspected the leaks had started soon after the accident, which resulted in a nuclear meltdown. The admission by the ministry, confirmed by Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), which runs the plant, is likely to keep Hisanohama's 40 fishing boats in port for the foreseeable future. Tepco's failure to handle the contaminated water – and accusations that it tried to cover up the leaks – is a serious setback to attempts to clean up Fukushima Daiichi, 18 months after the government declared it had reached a \"safe\" state known as cold shutdown. \"I haven't been able to fish since the tsunami,\" Niitsuma said inside the concrete shell of the port's main building, whose foundations sank by up to a metre because of the force of the March 2011 quake. \"People want to be reassured that they are buying fish that is safe to eat, and we can't give them that guarantee at the moment,\" he said. Evidence that quantities of radioactive caesium-134 and -137 in locally caught fish have fallen to levels close to the government-set safe limit of 100 becquerels per kilogram is scant consolation, Niitsuma said. \"At times like this, it feels like the nuclear problem will never be resolved, and for that Tepco and the government must take responsibility.\" In a furious letter to Tepco's president, Naomi Hirose, Japan's national fisheries federation said the water leakages were an \"act of treason to all fishing industry workers and to all members of the public in Japan\". The government imposed a ban on fishing in the Fukushima area after the tsunami, which killed more than 18,000 people along Japan's north-east coast and triggered the worst nuclear accident in the country's history. Niitsuma's 15-metre boat, Sueyoshi Maru, has been idle ever since. Unable to make a living from a sea poisoned by radiation, the town's 70 fishermen earn money clearing tsunami debris; the only fish they catch are taken not to market, but to makeshift labs where they are tested for radiation from the plant, located just 12 miles to the north. Tepco pumps out 400 tonnes of water a day of groundwater into the basements of damaged reactor buildings. There, it mixes with highly radioactive water that has already been used to cool the melted fuel, which is thought to lie deep inside the reactors. The firm had consistently denied there were any leaks, saying it had contained excess water by hardening soil with sodium silicate to form a chemical \"wall\" around areas thought to be at the greatest risk. But the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other experts have said the seepage will not affect areas beyond the sea directly off the coast of Fukushima Daiichi. \"Even 300 tonnes [a day] — that's still going to be diluted to an almost undetectable level before it would get to any US territory,\" said the commission's information officer Scott Burnell. Having conceded it had lost the ability to control the tainted water, Tepco promised to pump out tonnes of it and reinforce soil barriers. It also plans to build a 1.4km wall of soil, frozen solid by coolant, around four of the plant's six reactors by July 2015, in an attempt to prevent any further leakages. Early estimates put the cost of the wall at 40bn yen (£266m), making it more likely that the government, which has already loaned Tepco billions of yen to compensate victims and decommission the plant, will use public money to help stem the flow of radioactive water. Tepco's sudden about-turn over the leaks have added to public anger about its handling of the crisis. The disaster forced the evacuation of 160,000 people as radiation spewed from the plant, bringing Fukushima's farming and fishing industries to their knees. \"It's like there's an allergy to the name Fukushima,\" said Takashi Niitsuma, head of sales at the Iwaki fisheries co-operative, of which Hisanohama is a part. \"Even if we could catch fish for sale, no one would buy them. We're talking about the Pacific Ocean, so it's not just Fukushima that's affected by the contamination. If Tepco allows more water to leak into the sea, the criticism will be worldwide. For us as fishermen, it's not a question of whether we can revive the Fukushima brand – we have no choice. We have to at least try.\" Tepco's promises to address the water problem did not even convince the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, whose support for nuclear power remains unshakeable. \"There is heightened concern among the public, particularly about the contaminated water problem,\" Abe said this week. \"This is an urgent matter that needs to be addressed. Instead of leaving everything to Tepco, we need to create a firm national strategy.\" Japan's newly launched Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) indicated that it, too, had lost faith in the utility's ability to manage the water crisis, the latest setback in a cleanup and decommissioning operation that is expected to take more than 40 years and cost $11bn. The authority said Tepco \"lacked a sense of crisis\" about the threat to the marine environment. \"Right now, we have an emergency,\" said Shinji Kinjo, an NRA official in charge of addressing the water leaks, adding that the flow of water \"could accelerate very quickly\". Campaigners accused regulators of concentrating on the possible restart of Japan's idled nuclear reactors rather than ensuring Fukushima Daiichi's safety. \"More than two years after the Fukushima disaster, the Japanese government isn't any closer to taking control of the situation,\" said Hisayo Takada of Greenpeace Japan. \"The government must hold the nuclear industry responsible for the catastrophe and seek expert assistance from other countries. \"The leakage of radiation from the Fukushima plant to the ocean is a disaster for marine life and Japanese fisheries, but Tepco has consistently hidden and understated the seriousness of the leaks.Tepco is clearly incapable of dealing with the ongoing disaster and cannot be trusted to handle the situation appropriately.\" In the minutes before the tsunami crashed into Hisanohama, Kazuo Niitsuma, like many other fishermen, saved his boat by steering it out to sea and into the path of the waves. More than two years on, he can't escape the feeling that his act of bravery was in vain. His catch once fetched premium prices; now he lives off a government wage for collecting debris and modest compensation for loss of income. \"The nuclear disaster has left us with no motivation,\" he says. \"Nothing has changed, so there's nothing to look forward to. But I've been a fisherman for 48 years and I'm not going to give up now.\" • This article was edited on 12 August, 2013.

Solar power output has expanded sharply to 38.2 gigawatts (GW) since the region’s last notable eclipse in 2003, so the country - which borders nine nations - has to prove its power market and network handling centres can function under extraordinary conditions. Forecasts for the day’s solar output had earlier risen to 22 GW - the equivalent of 20 nuclear power stations - indicating greater potential for disruptions as the eclipse cuts out the sun’s rays. The daily peak in 2014 was 23.4 GW. Boom, boom: The Mirror claims its online readership has eclipsed that of the Sun, the Press Gazette reports. The newspaper today ran an advert, also displayed on a digital billboard at Westfield Shepherd’s Bush, with the words: “Eclipse of The Sun. Total Audience 17.5M v The Sun 13.6M”. The advert comes after National Readership Survey figures from last month showed The Sun’s monthly net readership, online and in print, is 13.6m, behind Metro, The Guardian and the Telegraph. Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gets in on the act by modelling today’s must-have item. The Guardian has been sifting through a pile of your underwhelming eclipse photos. The competition has been intense. London’s Science Museum has put together a great Storify collection of its eclipse related historic documents, illustrations and artefacts. Just about the best spot to view the eclipse from in Truro turned out to be the crown court car park high above the cathedral’s gothic spires, writes Steven Morris. Criminals, lawyers and judges paused to take in the show. Barrister Adrian Chaplin, who came equipped with a piece of dark glass from a welder’s mask, described the eclipse as “simply stunning”. “When you see the disc sliding across it stops you short,” he said before hurrying off for a trial. Nearby in Victoria Gardens, shopworkers Kathryn Connelly and Morwenna Davey arrived with Bucks Fizz and Jaffa Cakes to hold a breakfast time eclipse party. “This sort of thing doesn’t happen very often,” said Connelly, “So we thought we’d make an event of it.” The Bucks Fizz was to get the party off to a sparkling start, the Jaffa Cakes were so they could re-enact chunks being taken out of the sun. They did well with the supplies but their methods of actually seeing the eclipse were less successful – a couple of pieces of card with pinholes pricked through and a copy of the Sun newspaper, which supplied an eclipse watching device that they just could not get to work. Luckily a friendly park keeper had also gone down the welder’s mask route. “It’s amazing,” said Connelly after taking a turn, “It makes you stop and think and wonder at the universe.” As the eclipse proceeded it did noticeably darken and chill in the park. Breath froze and even the seagulls quietened, even if their squawks did not completely cease. There was a strange second dawn chorus as the light came back. Neil and Catherine Williams had arrived with a colander (a method championed by Professor Brian Cox) and a piece of white paper to try to view the phenomenon. It, too, was not wholly successful and they resorted to the park keeper’s glass. It was worth it. “It’s beautiful,” said Mr Williams. “It’s the sort of thing that reminds you, there’s so much to wonder at in the world.” Several hundred people gathered in Manchester’s Piccadilly Gardens to watch the eclipse including one of the city’s more entrepreneurial residents, writes Helen Pidd. He had a Jiffy bag full of scraps of welding glass he was hawking for £2 a go. Ben Warburton bought a bit. “He said he was a teacher but the kids hadn’t turned up yet. Unless it was a blag,” said Warburton, tailing off as the penny dropped. But nevermind: “It was awesome, worth being a bit late for work.” On the other side of the square, a heavily bearded chap called Simon was one of the few equipped with a pair of special cardboard specs. Proving that the hoarders of the world have the last laugh, he had saved them from 1999, when they came free with the Birmingham Post to coincide with the last solar eclipse. An eastern European lady called Gosia had also come prepared with some glasses she’d bought off Ebay for £2 a fortnight ago. Dale Vinton, 25, had come armed with his dad’s welding goggles. “Me dad said to me this morning: don’t you be going and looking at the sun with no googles on,” he said. “It’s good, innit?” Another Simon, a 43-year-old locksmith, was just wearing his Madchester shades and enjoying the spectacle by smoking a rollie. “I’m not blind yet,” he said, bemoaning the clouds which kept obscuring the show. “Typical Manchester. It was lovely and sunny yesterday and today it’s cloudy. Happens every time.” A young lad walked up and said he only realised what was going on when he got on the bus. “We should have these things more often,” said Simon. “See, it makes strangers talk to each other.” Pick your favourite in this Guardian gallery of eclipse photos. Journalism studetn Shreya Kalra snapped some nice images in Sheffield. Glaswegian sun-watchers have been rewarded for their patience, writes Owen Duffy. The thick grey cloud obscuring the city’s sky parted for around three minutes at the high point of today’s solar eclipse, revealing a thin sliver of sun almost entirely covered by the moon. Student Stephen Henderson said: “It was totally worth coming out. It looked like we weren’t going to see anything and then, boom, the clouds cleared. “I’ve never studied astronomy, I’m a music student, but I knew this was going to be the place to be and it turned out to be pretty spectacular.” Labour MP Mary Creagh reports a productivity dip across the UK. MPs have at least been busy eclipse tweeting. Here’s a cross-party selection. The BBC has been cheating by flying above the cloud in a star gazing plane. But the images of totality have been pretty stunning. Totality has been reached in the Faroe Islands. For those of us in London, it’s getting dark but there’s not much chance of seeing any evidence of the eclipse as it’s so overcast and grey, writes Mark Tran. Here are some of the grumpy tweets from the capital. GuardianWitness users have been sharing their eclipse images. Here’s a couple from Falkirk and Brighton. Barrister Adrian Chaplin hopes his case in Truro doesn’t start before totality. He tells Steve Morris the eclipse has been “stunning” so far. Others are planning to go back to work after cracking open the bubbly. And welding masks are better than colanders, according to these two.. Helen Pidd has joined the eclipse watchers in Manchester. Totality getting closer. The bubbly has being popped early in Bristol. And Truro ... The Guardian’s man in the south-west Steven Morris has been donning his welder’s lens in Truro. The chancellor George Osborne has been eclipsed. Iain Maciver at one of Scotland’s most impressive prehistoric sites, the Callanish Stones on Lewis, reports: There are about seventy of us here, and several small dogs. I can see three … four satellite trucks, a lot of media - I’ve just been speaking to a reporter from New Zealand - and many, I hesitate to call them New Age types but certainly colourful people, the kind that you get at ancient monuments like these.” The sun has been obscured by a dense bank of cloud - but that is just beginning to break up and we are hopeful that we may actually get a good view of the eclipse by 9.30. The best image so far comes from Bridgwater in Somerset. Here’s the first image of first contact. First contact in the UK has now been seen over Cornwall. Sky News is showing footage from Newquay. First contact has been seen over Madrid as the live feed above has been showing. Even the south France is expected to witness a 65% eclipse, and in Calvados country it will be nearer 80%. While we wait for “first contact” – the moment when moon first starts take a bite out of the sun, here’s some background. The last times the Guardian ran a celestial live blog was for the Transit of Venus in 2012 when the tiny dot of Venus passed between the sun and Earth. The BBC’s weather unit has a handy guide to the best places in the UK to see (with glasses) given the current cloud coverage. News from Svalbard ... A team of scientists from Aberystwyth University are hoping to bag some of the best views by travelling to the Norwegian Arctic islands as part of an expedition to study the sun’s atmosphere. They will use specialist cameras to photograph the sun at different frequencies during the eclipse to catch images of iron in the plasma emitted from the sun’s corona. They have been based at the Longyearbyen observatory Svarlbard’s frozen wastes all week, as Nathalia Alzate from the university’s solar system physics group explains. Aberystwyth’s Dr Huw Morgan told the Guardian’s Science podcast that the eclipse provided a rare opportunity to gauge the heat of the corona in the hope of explaining why it is so hot. (Scroll forward to around 26 minutes). Welcome to our live coverage of the eclipse of the sun. For the next fews hours this is going to be the hub of all things eclipse. As Bonnie Tyler didn’t sing it’s a total blog of the eclipse The total eclipse will only be visible in the Faroe Islands (population 49,947) and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard (population 2,642) in the Arctic Ocean. But if there’s no cloud (which is a big if) there will be an impressive partial eclipse in many parts of northern Europe. Generally the further north you are the more of the sun will be obscured by the moon. Shetland for example will see 97% of the sun blocked, in London it will be more like 85%. But it rather depends on the weather. In the UK, if the forecast is correct, the Midlands, Lincolnshire, parts of the south-west and Wales are expected to see the best views. Be warned: DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN. Use specialist eclipse viewers, or a pin hole camera with your back to the sun, or even a kitchen colander. The moon should start to block the sun from between 07.30 and 0.830 GMT and a full eclipse is expected at around 09.45 GMT. It’ll all be over from 10.30 to 11.30 GMT when the full sun is uncovered again. It is a “spectacular” thing to experience, according to Britain’s favourite scientist Professor Brian Cox who travelled to India to see an eclipse in 2009. “You see the mechanics of the solar system in action,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. He explained that while the moon is 400 times smaller than sun is also is 400 times closer to earth, so it can perfectly obscure the sun given the rare alignment we are about to witness. Lucie Green from the Society of Popular Astronomy provides a video guide to what’s going to happen plus more tips on the safest ways of observing the eclipse. My colleague Nadia Khomami has put together a guide of what you need to know. It is expected to be the best eclipse visible in the UK since 1999."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/gallery/2013/apr/14/chernobyl-ghost-town-in-pictures","type":"gallery","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-14T14:27:11Z","webTitle":"Chernobyl's ghost town - in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2013/apr/14/chernobyl-ghost-town-in-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/gallery/2013/apr/14/chernobyl-ghost-town-in-pictures","fields":{"headline":"Chernobyl's ghost town - in pictures","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/feb/16/water-shortages-electricity-supply-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-16T18:45:26Z","webTitle":"Water shortages could disrupt Britain's electricity supply, researchers warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/16/water-shortages-electricity-supply-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/feb/16/water-shortages-electricity-supply-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Water shortages could disrupt Britain's electricity supply, researchers warn","bodyText":"Parts of Britain may be under water after the worst floods in half a century, but a team of top academics from Newcastle and Oxford University is warning that the country is at risk of water shortages that could shut down power stations and paralyse electricity supplies. \"It is difficult to fathom we should start to think about water shortages in the middle of these storms but only two years ago areas of Britain were suffering from severe droughts,\" said Ed Byers, a researcher at Newcastle University's engineering and geosciences department. \"The high dependency on water in electricity generation means there is a real possibility that in just a few decades some power stations may be forced to decrease production or shut down if there are water shortages, which may be expected with changes in climate and a growing population.\" Byers, with another Newcastle colleague and Professor Jim Hall, director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University, has been studying the impact on water of the government's proposed different energy \"pathways\" taken from the 2011 Carbon Plan. Their new academic paper makes clear that one Department of Energy and Climate Change option – of using gas or other fossil fuels with high levels of carbon capture and storage (CCS) – could increase fresh water consumption by almost 70%. Another option – using high levels of nuclear power – could lead to increases in the use of tidal and coastal water by almost 400%. Although sea water is clearly in much greater supply than fresh water from rivers, the increase in use could bring with it much more impact on the environment because of potentially harmful heated-water emissions. Using wind power, in contrast, could save water. The academics conclude that a high level of wind or other renewable power technology, with a consequent reduction of other more water-intensive power systems, could result in fresh water consumption falling in the electricity sector by about 60%. The academics have not looked at the impact of fracking – which uses huge amounts of water – but they say it would only increase pressure on water supplies even more. Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace, said the academics had again highlighted a significant concern: \"This government's strategy for energy is immensely water intensive with nuclear, gas and now fracking requiring huge amounts of clean water to make them operational. There is a credible solution staring the government in the face; one that can create jobs and deliver economic growth and that solution is renewable energy and efficiency.\" The research is published in the social and natural sciences journal, Global Environmental Change. • This article was amended on 18 February 2014 to update the fact that the research has now been published and to provide a link to it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/oct/14/george-osborne-china-visa","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-13T03:30:00Z","webTitle":"George Osborne opens doors to rich Chinese with new visa system","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/14/george-osborne-china-visa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/oct/14/george-osborne-china-visa","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne opens doors to rich Chinese with new visa system","bodyText":"George Osborne has heralded the \"next big step\" in Britain's relationship with Beijing, unveiling a new visa system to make it easier for Chinese business leaders and rich tourists to visit the UK. In a sign of Downing Street's determination to reset relations with Beijing, which unofficially downgraded Britain's status after David Cameron met the Dalai Lama last year, the chancellor told an audience in the Chinese capital that no country in the west is more keen to attract Chinese investment than Britain. Osborne, who began a five-day trade mission to China at the weekend, told students at Beijing University: \"I don't want us to try to resist your economic progress, I want Britain to share in it. \"And I want, this week, us all to take the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China. Because more jobs and investment in China mean more jobs and investment in Britain. And that equals better lives for all.\" As a first step the chancellor announced Britain will make it easier for Chinese business leaders to visit the UK by introducing a 24-hour \"super priority\" visa service. In the biggest step, a separate pilot scheme will allow selected Chinese travel agents to apply for UK visas simply by submitting the application form used for the EU Schengen visa. The scheme is aimed specifically at the high-end tourism market, after figures showed that wealthy Chinese tourists are not bothering to apply for a UK visa after applying for a Schengen visa, which allows them to visit 22 out of the 28 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Ministers were understood to be alarmed when one study found that Chinese tourists were buying vastly higher numbers of expensive designer handbags in Paris than in London. The chancellor said: \"These changes will streamline and simplify the visa application process for Chinese visitors, while ensuring the system is strong and secure. This is good news for British business and tourism.\" The Foreign Office has no difficulty with the relaxed visa system, which will be administered through its embassy in Beijing and consulates in Shanghai and other high-growth cities. But concerns have been voiced to the chancellor and the prime minister from within the Foreign Office that Britain needs to tread with care in the light of China's human rights record and its aggressive cyber-attacks. Cameron is understood to have heard the Foreign Office's concerns with sympathy. But he is determined to open a new chapter in Britain's relations with China after declaring that the \"Bric\" countries – Brazil, Russia, India and China – would be a priority. He has led two trade missions to India but has visited China only once as prime minister, three years ago. Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, who has recently returned from Beijing, spoke of a \"massive Chinese investment\" worth tens of billions of pounds in nuclear power and other sources of energy in Britain. Davey told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 that there would also be major energy investments from Japan and South Korea. The China General Nuclear Power Group has been in talks with EDF Energy about taking a stake of up to 49% in the deal to build a nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point. Osborne's trip – in which he is being accompanied in part by the London mayor, Boris Johnson, and four other government ministers – is designed to pave the way for a long-awaited trade mission to China by the prime minister. Cameron was forced to abandon a visit to China earlier this year when Beijing punished him for meeting the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, at St Paul's Cathedral in May 2012 with Nick Clegg. The prime minister abandoned tentative plans for a trip to China in April after Beijing indicated that he was unlikely to be granted meetings with senior figures. The UK government said no plans had been finalised and the new Chinese leadership, which only took over in March, needed time to bed down. The Osborne and Cameron trips, which have been pencilled in for the autumn for some months, have been the subject of intense negotiations in Whitehall. The chancellor is said by some ministerial sources to be adopting a gung-ho approach and is keen to explore every opportunity to boost trade links with China. \"With George it all comes to pounds, shillings and pence at the end of the day,\" said one ministerial source. Britain's nervousness about the Dalai Lama was highlighted when Johnson declined on five occasions on Sky News to say whether he would like to meet Tibet's spiritual leader. On the fifth occasion an exasperated mayor told Dermot Murnaghan: \"This is the fifth time, I'm coming up for air again, Dermot, I'm just repeating that it's not my job as mayor to insert myself into controversial areas of international dispute. My job is to promote the interests of the city.\" In his speech Osborne said: \"There are some in the west who see China growing and they are nervous. They think of the world as a cake – and the bigger the slice that China takes, the smaller the slice that they will get. I totally and utterly reject that pessimistic view. If we make the whole cake bigger, then all our peoples will benefit. That should be the basis of our relationship with China.\" In addition to Beijing Osborne will visit Shenzen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2015/mar/17/climate-change-demands-immense-economic-changes","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-17T21:06:53Z","webTitle":"Climate change demands immense changes to the economic system","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/17/climate-change-demands-immense-economic-changes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2015/mar/17/climate-change-demands-immense-economic-changes","fields":{"headline":"Climate change demands immense changes to the economic system","bodyText":"Mark Lynas says: “Solving climate change does not mean rolling back capitalism, suspending the free market or stopping economic growth” (Save us from the miserabilists in the battle over climate change, 12 March). This statement would have made much sense 35 years ago. The urgency for rapid action had not been established. But all this has changed. Whether or not the new “crisis” reinforces an ideological position on the left (despite splits over nuclear power and GM crops) leading to “an outright denialist position” on the right is now so much water under the bridge. Immense changes to the economic system must be made over the next few years, and the blame game gets us nowhere. If Klein’s belief that “corporate capitalism must be dismantled’” is wrong, it is up to the right to show how the new measures required can work under the present system. Governments should play a powerful role in facilitating compromises, where these can be made, and encouraging national debates on the basis of evidence rather than belief. David Anderson Bingley, West Yorkshire • It’s people like Naomi Klein and the left generally who are responsible for runaway climate change because their policies for dealing with it are too radical, says Lynas. So they frighten all those fair-minded, reasonable people in the centre and on the right into not caring a fig about it. Then the penny dropped. I realised Lynas was himself a Damascene convert, projecting all blame on to his erstwhile colleagues and comrades of “the left”. The solution is staring us in the face: it is nuclear energy and GM crops. Funny, that’s what big money has been telling (or selling) us all along. You don’t have to be “anti-science” to suspect the alliance of money and power that the corporate world represents. Being suspicious of it seems a good, open-minded place to start. Richard Kuper London • Sound advice to non-tribal environmentalists from Mark Lynas: ignore both the flat-earth deniers and the eco-evangelists, and focus on good science, engineering, arithmetic and economics. If Keep it in the ground prompts a flight of capital away from fossil fuels and into clean, 21st-century energy solutions, we should investigage two constructive (and liquid) investment zones: small, modular, molten-salt reactors, being developed by the Canadians and the Chinese; and molten-metal, grid-level storage batteries, being piloted in Hawaii and Cape Cod. John McGrother Buxton, Derbyshire • Lynas uses the wrong end of the stick to beat the wrong dog. Since the mid-1960s the “war on science” has been waged against any change that might have an adverse impact on vested interest. It began with a campaign against the regulation of tobacco products, orchestrated by the marketing Company RJ Reynolds. This was followed by a war against the regulation of other health or environmental hazards reported by the scientific community, for instance, ozone depletion. State interference of any kind, including against the causes of acid rain, CFCs, greenhouse gases and secondhand smoke, was (and is still) seen as an attack on liberty, a dangerous step on the path to communism: “Environmentalists were like a watermelon, green on the outside, red within,” Naomi Oreskes wrote in Merchants of Doubt (2010). Wiebina Heesterman Birmingham • The scientific narrative has not been “captured by one, rather extreme, end of the political spectrum”, but by global industries whose profits are threatened by the carbon bubble that will result if substantial fossil fuel deposits remain unexploited (the deniers) and by people who accept the scientific evidence but dwell on the apocalyptic image of a future world of runaway warming (the sensationalists). Apocalyptic images are exciting; they produce adrenalin, which is addictive. That is why disaster movies are big box-office. But this makes climate change just another spectacle. Lynas himself is a leading producer of this commodity in his books. It is a bit rich, then, that he accuses Naomi Klein of pursuing an “ideological project”, as if climate change could be anything else (but the right usually denies the politics of its own position). Klein has identified aspects of this late phase of global capitalism – the huge profits made from war and reconstruction, and the growth of a private security industry – that show it to be aggressively destructive. Environmentalists do not have a monopoly on Enlightenment values – no one does – but when Lynas asserts that Klein makes environmental responsibility “politically toxic” he is insulting and, again, alarmist, which is another indication that he is a purveyor of the alienation to which he objects. He makes the debate a spectacle rather than a rational exchange. Professor Malcolm Miles Totnes, Devon • The developing world’s emergence from poverty is indeed non-negotiable. Climate chaos doesn’t negotiate. But climate chaos is what will stop the developing world from acquiring, and the developed world from continuing to enjoy, unprecedented and lethal levels of material consumption. Our challenge is not to fantasise about technologies to save us from this future. It is to face it honestly, and start retrieving what we can. John Foster Lancaster University • Had Lynas attended the alternative people’s summit at the COP 20 climate change talks in Lima last year, he would have heard a succession of speakers from Latin America’s indigenous communities rejecting development models imposed on them by transnational capital. They are in the frontline of the fight against climate change and are struggling to stop the destruction of their environment by mining and mono-crop agriculture for export. They would not see themselves in terms of left or right, but fully understand that an economic model based on infinite growth, with the conmensurate depletion of the planet’s natural resources, is incompatible with saving the Earth from the catastrophic effects of global warming. This does not mean sufficient energy cannot be provided for the needs of future generations, but that it must be responsibly sourced and publicly owned instead of being left to market forces and monolithic corporations whose priorities lie in ripping off consumers and making money out of burning fossil fuels. As an energy trade union, we support the necessary, just transition to a low-carbon economy, and are members of the global network Trade Unions for Energy Democracy. As the slogan read in Lima: “Let’s change the system – not the climate.” Bert Schouwenburg International officer, GMB • I went to the climate change march on Saturday 7 March expecting to be fired up. I came away disappointed. The issue, climate change, had been hijacked by multiple organisations pushing their own agendas – anti- nuclear, anti fracking, trade unions, political groups etc. Anyone viewing on TV would probably see several organisations they would not support. Earth is not affected by politics, just by CO2 emissions. The climate change movement has to work from the bottom up to change the minds of people in every country, so as to cause each country’s government to take action. Hugh Baker Leatherhead, Surrey • I picked up a programme for the Edinburgh international science festival in the week that the Guardian ran its stark climate change cover features. I was surprised to note the low profile given in the brochure to the most pressing issue facing scientists, and humanity in general, until I looked at the sponsors page: Total, Scottish Gas, Senergy, Eon, Exxon Mobil, Cairn and half a dozen other fossil fuel extraction and provision companies are prominent. All the energy events, which mostly focus on technological responses, are directly sponsored by Eon. A typical example is a debate on “how much oil is really left in the North Sea and what its value is… supported by the Scottish Oil Club”, the panel of which is entirely made up of oil industry representatives plus the shadow energy minister. The National Gallery in London has attracted criticism for accepting BP sponsorship but at least there was no direct conflict of interest. Such financing makes a mockery of the objectivity the festival is designed to promote. Technological fixes are mostly a distraction from the urgent issue of drastically reducing emissions this decade, which extends beyond the boundaries of science. Climate scientists have attracted flak for not speaking out more. They have done their job. What about the scientists who are the crux of the fossil fuel industry, not to mention those who work directly in public engagement through events such as this festival? How can they be aware of the imminent catastrophe facing our planet and yet continue to facilitate it? Are their personal interests in their job not overridden by their personal interests in their future and that of their children? Andrew Rubens Edinburgh • Lynas’s article does not do justice to the great campaign of concern the Guardian has embarked upon. By its very nature, climate change is an extreme situation that demands extreme measures. Now is not a time for fudging about, desperately trying to seek some kind of moderate consensus that has no hope of tackling this global threat. Does he really imagine that the rich and powerful will finally face up to what is already happening to us without an intensification of the international pressure for absolutely fundamental change to the way we live our lives? When have they ever given anything up without an enormous struggle? The article could be read as some kind of PR appeal to take the debate back to square one on behalf of corporate interests. We have been discussing climate change for decades and, as Naomi Klein has said: “The only thing rising faster than our emissions is the output of words pledging to lower them.” Just because billions of us have long since recognised the link between capitalism’s insatiable appetite for growth and consumption and its catastrophic effects on our resources and climate doesn’t make that analysis wrong. Nor is it the preserve of “lefties”. Accepting the doubling or trebling of energy consumption by 2050 as a “hard reality” in a world that supposedly must continue to go on developing and expanding will not help anyone, nor will being an apologist for capitalism’s excesses. Can he not see that we may be forced to accept a simpler life, which, paradoxically, may make us more content in the long term? Have we really got an alternative to this? Peter Strother Upper Finlarig, Highland • Campaigning on climate change should not be aligned to the left. The crucial element of change in British society is the small-C conservative. The anti-roads campaign of the 90s stopped hundreds of roads because local people, often Conservatives, came out to defend their countryside. My father-in-law, a staunch Labour supporter, worked closely with the local Tory mayor to deliver a superb children’s playground and a community bus service in Lichfield. Our conservative MP spent hours on the phone to persuade the local council to allow a community garden. However, the issue is not about left or right but about thinkers and doers. The small-C conservative wants to make it happen, not to have a discussion about “inclusive proposals” and “social consensus”. Environmentalists tend to be good at attending general meetings about renewable energy but, when an application for a real wind turbine is before a council, they rarely engage. The green NGOs need to stop concentrating on attracting the thinkers and e-petition signers but also to engage apolitically with the rest of society on practical solutions with local councils, planning, communities and MPs. Victoria Harvey Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire • Lynas is spot-on. The triumph of ideology over scientific evidence hampers effective policy to slow down global warming. Opposition among greens to fracking is an outstanding example. Of course the location of fracking must take account of local geology and social factors, but the country that has recently done more than any other to slow global warning has been the United States, which has greatly reduced its carbon emissions by switching massively from coal to gas. It did so by unlocking vast reserves of shale gas through fracking. The most urgent need in policy on climate change is to prevent the huge projected increase in the building of coal-fired power stations. Gas is still a fossil fuel and can be only a transitional solution. But its carbon impact is about half that of coal. It can give us a breathing space, more effectively and quickly than any alternative now on offer. We need time to develop the most effective long-term solutions to avoid a catastrophic rise in global temperatures. Dick Taverne House of Lords • Lynas assumes the classic sophist mantle, exposed by Socrates some centuries ago, but regularly recycled as the comfort-zone from which to launch any “plague on both your houses” diatribe when serious change threatens or is needed. Characteristically, for him it is the left that is most at fault, because “the left’s global doom threats … have made the right embrace denialism” – rather than any long-term corporate commitment to poorly controlled carbon release. His acerbic parody of Naomi Klein’s analysis and intention raises questions about his own motives and affiliations, and are a gratuitous insult to people around the world who are coming together to keep up the pressure on governments and corporations to clean up their acts before it is too late. The scientists are predominantly on their side, too. Is Lynas’s real fear that the difficult processes of coping with climate change, in so far as they achieve success, will trigger new, more insistent questions about how we allowed our world to degenerate to this extent, and how the causes may correlate with those of other issues – inequality, educational opportunity, economic malfunction and so on?

Speaking on 22 September at a Guardian fringe event sponsored by Hitachi Europe at the Labour party conference, Wright said that the coalition government had cut infrastructure investment \"far too quickly and far too severely\". He called for cross-party support for an independent commission to plan major future UK projects – one of the recommendations in the report published on 5 September by Olympics chief Sir John Armitt, who said a dedicated infrastructure body would be able to tackle the country's congested roads, the threat of power shortages and the risk of droughts. \"What we need to keep the lights on and keep us moving is to think about the next 25 to 30 years,\" said Wright. \"We need an independent commission with a strict pipeline of projects.\" Alistair Dormer, executive chairman and chief executive officer at Hitachi Rail Europe, agreed. \"We do need an infrastructure plan,\" he said, adding that Armitt's recommendations were important because they addressed more than just investment in HS2. Dormer said the UK was a long way behind on high-speed rail, and could learn from China and Japan. \"We should be talking about all the other investments in rail we should also be making,\" he said, adding that the amount of land needed for HS2 in the Chilterns was \"miniscule\" in comparison with the land needed for the M40 motorway. John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said it was essential to have a planning mechanism at national level for national decisions. The present system was \"ridiculous\" he said, and had blocked too much development. \"We can't allow nimbys to stop these developments,\" he added. Longworth also said it was a misconception that if HS2 were cancelled, the money would be invested in other rail upgrades. \"There's no guarantee if would go anywhere at all,\" he said. Alan Raymant, chief operating officer of Horizon Nuclear Power, which is building two new UK nuclear power plants, agreed with the need for a long-term infrastructure policy, particularly to support better energy security for the nation. \"The short-term challenge is having sufficient capacity to meet our energy needs as well as meet environment targets,\" he said.

And then it gets rather more hair-raising. The next two trips involve 70mph plunges over jagged quarries and old mine workings. There isn't time to enjoy the sights; it feels more like a matter of clinging on for dear life. This is Zip World Titan, billed as the attraction that will turn north Wales into the zip wire capital of the world and help build the area's reputation as an international adventure destination. The team behind the £1m project in (and above) Blaenau Ffestiniog claim there are now more hi-tech zip lines in a 25-mile radius around this slate mining town than anywhere else on Earth. \"I guarantee you'll love it,\" said Sean Taylor, co-owner and former Royal Marine commando, as he supervised the thankfully thorough strapping in and hooking up process on the summit of Cribau mountain, high above Blaenau. \"And it's perfectly safe. In fact, we've slowed this first ride down so that you can enjoy the views. We don't like to say it's an extreme experience. It's more a challenging experience.\" The panorama is spectacular. Way in the distance is the great lump of Cadair Idris, a favourite hikers' mountain that dominates the southern end of Snowdonia national park. To the north-west is Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales, while in the middle distance are the blocky towers of the disused Trawsfynydd nuclear power station. Once strapped into a harness and hooked up to the wire (most of the gear is made in Wales, though the cable is manufactured in Italy), staff check the landing area is clear, open the gates on the metal platform and the zip-wire fliers, wearing bright red overalls and helmets, zoom out into open space. Although relatively gentle, the first ride is not tranquil: even on a rare windless day the rushing air makes the swoop a noisy one. And the promise on the publicity bumph that the flight mimics that of a peregrine falcon may be exaggerated – it is hard not to end up twisted around if you turn to look back towards Snowdon. No peregrine ends up coming down sideways. But even if you don't quite feel like a falcon, there is no doubt that it is thrilling to be flying down over the greens, browns and greys of the moor. The instruction for the second ride over the quarry workings is clear: \"Do not curl into a ball shape\". If you do, you will go too fast. It turns out that the moorland swoop was a warm-up. This one is a 70mph blast. The bright rhododendrons become a blur; there isn't really time to feel frightened before coming to a juddering halt on the far side of the quarry. And it is a communal affair. One of the selling points is that this is Europe's only four-person zip wire. A family or group of friends can fly in unison, enjoying each other's whoops and cries. The final zip is no slower, but it is different because you fly over some of the historical slate mine buildings that led to Blaenau becoming known as the town that roofed the world. At the height of the slate industry in the late 19th century, more than 4,000 people worked here. The decline of the town was as rapid as its rise – now only a handful of people continue to mine slate. \"We're a post-industrial town,\" said county councillor Paul Thomas, whose father, grandfather and great-grandfather worked in the slate mines. \"Jobs are hard to come by and it's important we find something else.\" Some of the older generation may be sceptical, but Thomas is sure a combination of heritage and adventure tourism is the way forward for the town. The Llechwedd Slate Caverns complex, where Zip Wire Titan is based, attracts thousands of visitors a year. Mountain bike trails ring the town and kayaking and climbing businesses are booming. Zip Wire Titan should bring many more visitors into Blaenau. \"There is a buzz in the town,\" said Thomas. The market hall, which has long lain empty, is being converted into an outdoors centre; the old Manod hotel is becoming a bunk house; a derelict chapel is being transformed into a family indoor play centre. \"Some people can't see the potential,\" said Thomas. \"They still want the heavy industry back. But that's not likely to happen.\" Welsh government figures show outdoor activity tourism is worth £481m to the country's economy and supports 8,243 Welsh jobs. The young tend to be less suspicious of the switch from digging underground to soaring above it. Iestyn Pritchard, 21, is among those who have been employed as an instructor at Zip Wire Titan. \"It's great for the area. There really isn't that much work round here. Most people have to leave to find a job. This is something new for the town. It can only be a good thing.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2013/nov/18/microgeneration-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-18T21:00:00Z","webTitle":"Letters: Microgeneration is the way ahead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/18/microgeneration-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/nov/18/microgeneration-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Microgeneration is the way ahead","bodyText":"Zoe Williams is on the right track when she finds the behaviour of the big six energy companies, and the government, hard to comprehend (Want an energy revolution? 13 November). It only begins to make sense when you delve into the implications of a showdown between a system based on big centralised energy generation and one based on a huge number of small producers using a very large number of local but interconnected distribution grids. As things are, it is clear how big money can be made, taxes (if not off-shored) levied and pension funds boosted. Not so if households and businesses start setting up local generation schemes via charities and other community benefit vehicles that channel money back into local schemes. I am involved with a small fund that focuses on deprived areas, lending for renewable energy projects with social as well as environmental benefits. It is not short of applications. The way the money circulates in this sort of \"distributed\" system is the stuff of nightmares for the Treasury. So \"greed\" is indeed an unhelpful diagnosis of what is going on right now. Fear is the emotion gripping the big six and the government. Sara Parkin Founder director, Forum for the Future • Surely the time for decentralising our energy market has come? Many local councils, responsive to those severely affected by fuel poverty, want to see a microgeneration revolution and the opportunity to develop local energy schemes for the local community. The Feldheim experience in Germany (Report, 30 May 2012) could be translated across the British Isles. So instead of a big centralised renationalisation of energy, which isn't likely to happen, government should be encouraging local councils, parish councils, schools, businesses and communities to take control of their own energy needs. A co-ordinated approach of energy efficiency, community consultations and a wide renewable energy mix can power our communities in a far more efficient and responsive way than a £16bn nuclear power station ever will. Councillor Mark Hackett Chair of UK &amp; Ireland Nuclear Free Local Authorities • Former energy secretary Chris Huhne is right to link the increased frequency of extreme weather events with man-made climate change (Comment, 18 November). But he is wrong to suggest that the solutions lie in either nuclear power or carbon capture and storage. We already know the answers: more clean renewable energy generation and better energy use and energy conservation measures. I hope the world leaders meeting in Warsaw this week will commit to making rapid progress on reducing emissions in the next few years, using technology that has been around for decades . Jean Lambert MEP Green, London • \"With cheap batteries in the loft, home heat and light using low-carbon electricity will be attractive,\" Chris Huhne writes. Over the past 12 months my solar panels have put 2,142 kWh of electricity into the national grid (in the hours of daylight) and in the evenings I have drawn 2,177 kWh from the grid. So, if I had effective batteries I could be self-sufficient in electricity. As Huhne says, we need a massive research drive into storage batteries. Michael Bassey Newark, Nottinghamshire • Plug-in electric vehicles could help local authorities achieve healthy, prosperous and sustainable communities. The key issue is around having the infrastructure in place so that electric vehicle owners can charge their cars. The Department of Transport's £37m funding of charging points represents a step forward in this respect. Ensuring that charge points are installed correctly and are safe to use is essential to gaining consumer confidence. This is why the IET has published a code of practice for electrical vehicle charging equipment installation. To stimulate investment in this area the IET will shortly be making its guidance freely available to UK local authorities. We must integrate electric vehicle recharging with transport planning, network development and fleet procurement, to ensure that electric vehicles are a major part of future transport strategy.

The German industrial group said it had written to the Alstom board \"to signal its willingness to discuss future strategic opportunities\". The surprise move came after the French economy minister, Arnaud Montebourg, made it clear that he would actively seek \"other solutions\" to the GE bid. He told reporters on Friday that the government \"is expressing its patriotic concern and vigilance\". News of the GE move sent shockwaves through France, which fears American control of a big player in the strategic energy sector. Alstom – a direct rival of Siemens – builds high-speed TGV trains as well as power plants. GE was reported last Wednesday to have formally offered $13bn for Alstom's power turbines division, which contributes 70% of Alstom's revenues. The US bid does not involve Alstom's rail division, but the European counterproposal is reportedly designed to create a European energy business around Siemens and a transport group around Alstom. High-stakes talks between Montebourg and the GE boss, Jeffrey Immelt, were scheduled for Sunday before being delayed on the grounds that the government needed more time to study options in the light of the Siemens approach, and that no hasty decision should be taken. But French analysts said it was doubtful that the government would be able to influence the decision of the Alstom board, which met on Sunday evening. \"General Electric and Alstom have their timeframe, which is that of the shareholders, but the French government has its own, which is that of economic sovereignty,\" the economy ministry said in a statement. \"General Electric and Siemens are two important investors in France, and top-ranking players in our national industrial fabric. The government is prepared to consider their plans, with the concern of preserving the interests of France's industrial base, and to participate financially.\" French unions are urging the government to step in again to save Alstom, which was bailed out by the state in 2004 when Siemens was barred from acquiring it. Former industry minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement wrote to the prime minister, Manuel Valls, on Friday to seek his \"prompt intervention\". Chevènement, who fears that France risks becoming an \"amusement park\", warned that allowing GE to take over Alstom's energy branch would \"deal a fatal blow\" to France's nuclear energy sector. Chevènement is senator for Belfort, where both Alstom and GE employ more than 4,200 workers. It emerged on Sunday that Siemens chief executive Joe Kaeser, in his letter to Alstom boss Patrick Kron, was offering to swap the German group's high-speed trains and locomotives division plus cash – believed to be up to €11bn – in return for the French group's global power assets. Siemens and Alstom did not comment on the letter's contents on Sunday. But Montebourg appeared to favour the Siemens offer, which he said would create \"two European champions in the fields of energy and transport\", whereas the GE bid was \"a purchase of the energy part of Alstom\". However it appears that the Siemens bid resembles an offer from last February that was not taken up by the Alstom board. The French company's energy division includes turbines for coal, gas and nuclear power, but also windfarms and distribution grid equipment. President François Hollande, who has not yet intervened in the affair, evoked a vision of an \"Airbus for energy\" at his last press conference in January, referring to the successful Franco-German co-operation in building the European aircraft. The Alstom takeover battle is an early test of the new government of Valls, a pro-market social democrat who kept the interventionist Montebourg in the cabinet to appease the left wing of the ruling Socialist party. In his former role as minister for economic recovery, Montebourg blocked the sale of the French version of YouTube, Dailymotion, to the American company Yahoo, last May. Montebourg, whose motto is \"Made in France\", informed the Indian steel magnate Lakshi Mittal in 2012 that he \"was not welcome in France\" for wanting to close a plant in eastern France. Alstom shares were suspended on Friday following the news of GE's takeover bid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2015/apr/08/can-world-economy-survive-without-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-08T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"Can the world economy survive without fossil fuels? | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/apr/08/can-world-economy-survive-without-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2015/apr/08/can-world-economy-survive-without-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"Can the world economy survive without fossil fuels?","bodyText":"The final chapters of The Bone Clocks, David Mitchell’s 2014 novel, describe a future in which progress has gone into reverse. In 2043, the fossil fuel age is over: nuclear power stations ar e melting down, there is no access to the electricity grid and solar panels are so prized that they are looted. Catastrophic climate change has become a reality. Rising sea levels have caused floods on the New York City subway, killing thousands. Internet coverage is patchy, food and consumer goods are scarce, and life‑saving drugs such as insulin are hard to come by. It is a dystopian vision that looks like a brutal, dangerous version of the past – one not at all like the future that was promised when the cold war ended with victory for the western capitalist model. If it comes to pass, it will be because, despite all the warnings, climate change has not been taken seriously enough. Here is one such warning: “For generations, we have assumed that the efforts of mankind would leave the fundamental equilibrium of the world’s systems and atmosphere stable. But it is possible that with all these enormous changes – population, agricultural, use of fossil fuels – concentrated into such a short period of time, we have unwittingly begun a massive experiment with the system of this planet itself.” That was Margaret Thatcher, in a speech to Britain’s scientific elite in 1988. Thatcher was no climate change denier. She told the Royal Society that her government supported the idea of sustainable economic development, and concluded: “Stable prosperity can be achieved throughout the world, provided the environment is nurtured and safeguarded. Protecting this balance of nature is therefore one of the great challenges of the late 20th century.” It was, though, just one speech at a time of great global upheaval: China was liberalising its economy; apartheid was in its death throes in South Africa; above all, the cold war was coming to an end with defeat for the Soviet Union. “We know what works,” US president George HW Bush said at the time. “Free markets work.” The market model spread quickly to parts of the world that previously it could not touch: to China, where the reforms begun by Deng Xiaoping were accelerated; to India, where the idea that the world’s biggest democracy could go it alone was abandoned; to the Soviet Union and its former satellites, which received a strong dose of economic shock treatment. Within five years, the reach of the market economy had been extended to an additional 3 billion people. Some places remained off limits. Cuba, subject to a US economic embargo, was one such country. After decades of relying on Moscow for oil, chemical fertilisers, pesticides and a large chunk of its food, Fidel Castro’s government faced a crisis. The economy shrank and strict food rationing was imposed. There was an acute shortage of fuel for tractors. Calorie intake fell by a third. The Cuban government responded by creating urban farms: agriculture went local, small scale and – by necessity – organic. Food production became less oil-intensive, as every possible scrap of land was exploited. If the denouement of Mitchell’s novel presents one frightening future, Cuba provides another sketch of what could be in store if the transition from a fossil fuel world to one running on renewable energy does not go according to plan – less apocalyptic than The Bone Clocks, but with considerable drawbacks. The grow-your-own drive has only been partially successful: a quarter of a century later, food is still rationed in Cuba. Most of the world has gone in a different direction. In the west, there was a long economic boom that lasted from the early 1990s through to the financial crash of 2007. Growth rates in the developed world, however, were dwarfed by those in some of the bigger emerging economies. After the crash, when the developed world was struggling to emerge from the deepest slump since the Great Depression, it was China and India that acted as the engines of growth. In terms of reducing the number of people living below the global poverty line of $1.25 (84p) a day, the post-cold war model of capitalism has been a success. Fewer people go hungry. More have access to healthcare and education. The size of the global middle class has increased, and consumers in Shanghai and Mumbai have been able to afford cars and fridge-freezers. But this process has had two unattractive side effects. The first is that the balance of power in the workplace has tilted decisively in favour of capital over labour: with an abundance of cheap workers to choose from, employers can be mean with pay. The second is that the triumph of the market has put pressure on the planet, just as Thatcher suspected it might. As the west outsourced its manufacturing to low-cost centres in Asia, energy demand in China, India and Indonesia rocketed. Globalisation means that people in the developing world know how we live in the west and they want some of what we have. In addition to higher consumer spending, that also means higher demand for energy, the bulk of which comes from fossil fuels. China currently builds a new coal-fired power station every two weeks. Burning fossil fuels puts carbon into the atmosphere, and the overwhelming view of scientists is that this leads to a buildup of greenhouse gases that results in global warming. To have a realistic prospect of preventing global temperatures from rising by more than the previously recognised danger threshold of 2C, scientists say it is not possible to burn all the proven fossil fuel reserves owned by companies and governments. Between two-thirds and four-fifths will need to be left in the ground. The question, therefore, is whether it is possible to marry two seemingly contradictory objectives. Can we imagine a future that is cleaner, greener and sustainable – one that avoids climate armageddon – without abandoning the idea of growth and, thus, forcing living standards into decline? The answer is that it will be hellishly difficult, but it is just about feasible if we make the right choices – and start making them now. * * * Slowly, those in power are beginning to understand what is at stake: that if we carry on growing the global economy at its current rate, and continue to rely on fossil fuels to power that growth, the planet is going to cook. Not everybody buys into this narrative, of course. One of the challenges faced by those who wish to curtail fossil fuel use is that there is no political consensus on tackling climate change. The business-as-usual camp says that the scientific consensus is wrong about climate change, or that climate scientists have exaggerated the risks, which can be tackled if and when they become apparent. But Barack Obama does not think that way, and nor does China’s president, Xi Jinping, which is why they signed a deal in November 2014 setting targets for CO2 emissions up to 2030. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, does not believe it either, which is why he went public at the 2014 annual meeting of the World Bank with his view that the “vast majority of fossil fuel reserves are unburnable” if we wish to keep the increase in global temperatures below 2C. With the world barely recovered from one global recession, policymakers are now concerned about another. The talk at meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the G20 is whether the next financial crash will be caused by the pricking of the carbon bubble – the idea that the stock-market valuation of fossil fuel companies has been inflated by overestimating the worth of reserves of oil, coal and gas that could only be exploited by putting the climate at risk. In the unlikely event that investors all pulled out of fossil fuels at once, the result would be much worse than what followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 – a colossal stock market crash, followed by an equally epic slump. The Bank of England is sufficiently concerned to have launched an investigation into the risks of this happening. The odds are still against such a financial market meltdown. In part, that is because investors will probably move slowly. In part, it is because the reserves of the big western fossil fuel companies make up only a small chunk of the global total, and it is hard to see Vladimir Putin being too troubled by a divestment campaign. But the risk is now out there – and growing – because policymakers have now woken up to the risks of climate change. “There have been two terrible realisations,” says Michael Jacobs, who used to advise Gordon Brown on the issue. “We have started too late, and it doesn’t matter how much solar and wind power there is – you are still burning all the coal, oil and gas. Even if you do so more slowly, it will still go into the atmosphere and cause climate change.” Jacobs adds that, in the past quarter of a century, when countries could have been putting in place the infrastructure for a new green economy, they have been going in the opposite direction. They have invested in fossil fuel-burning power plants and built energy‑inefficient buildings in cities designed for cars. Carney believes climate change is the medium-term issue of our age, but talks about the “tragedy of horizons”. By this he means that central banks and finance ministers are set up to deal with short-term problems, such as whether inflation will hit its target in two or three years’ time, or whether another housing bubble can be prevented before the end of the decade. Governments are thinking about climate change, but they have other more immediate priorities: reducing unemployment, increasing living standards and, in the case of politicians rather than the technocrats running central banks, getting re-elected. To some in the environmental movement – the “deep greens” – it seems pointless to expect politicians to do anything meaningful about climate change: they are obsessed with growth for its own sake, bend the knee to fossil fuel companies when they demand tax breaks and subsidies, and are reluctant to back the potential of renewables. In order to avoid ecological suicide, they argue, we must first recognise that capitalism is an insuperable obstacle to any reduction in our fossil fuel consumption. All of this may be true, but it leaves unanswered the question of how we get from where we are now to the kind of world the deep greens want to see. Let us begin with one basic idea: 250 years of growth based on the exploitation of fossil fuels has brought real benefits. There are those who might argue otherwise, but life in the world before the industrial revolution really was nasty, brutish and short. Life expectancy was 40 at best, the working week was long, disease was rife and diets were poor. Life for the vast bulk of the population was strictly no-frills, as it had been for more than a millennium. The current coalition government in the UK has come under attack for allowing the economy to flatline for a couple of years, but incomes per head barely rose in the 1,300 years between the sacking of Rome and the mid‑18th century. The acceleration of growth and big increases in living standards only really began with the industrial revolution; they would not have happened without the exploitation of fossil fuels. Over the years, the idea that all growth is good became embedded. Parents expected their children to be better off than they were. Businesses that did not expand were viewed as failures. One four-letter word underpinned economics: more. And this, notwithstanding the corporate sustainability reports and the greenwashing, remains the case for even the most right-on companies. Unilever wants to sell more soap and deodorant. John Lewis commissions expensive ads to encourages us all to spend more at Christmas. Here at the Guardian, we want to sell more newspapers, and more ads to companies selling their own goods and services to readers. But the economics of more, together with a rapidly rising population, have created problems unforeseen at the time of James Watt’s steam engine. At the end of the 18th century there were fewer than 1 billion people on the planet. Today there are more than 7 billion. The energy needs of a bigger and richer global population have risen sixfold in the past 50 years. Almost 90% of that energy is provided by fossil fuels – coal, gas and oil. Global temperatures have risen by almost 1C above pre-industrial levels, and the number of weather-related natural disasters has increased. Those who say manmade global warming isn’t happening look more and more certain to end up on the wrong side of history – which will harshly judge our failure to act until the threat had become so obvious that we had no other options. * * * There are more climate change sceptics than we might like to think. But the problem goes much further than figures such as Tony Abbott, the prime minister of Australia, or Nigel Lawson, the former UK chancellor of the exchequer, or about every Republican harbouring hopes of winning the nomination for the 2016 US presidential race. That problem is us. Dieter Helm, professor of energy studies at Oxford University, says: “It’s not clear we’re very serious about climate change. We want other people to do stuff, we want to divest from companies – but what about us? We are ultimately the consumers of those carbon-based products, and when we elect politicians, what’s worrying is that we’re not prepared to say: ‘Make us pay for the damage and the pollution we cause.’” This is an uncomfortable thought. If climate change can simply be blamed on “the Man”, on the evils of capitalism, or on a cabal of fossil fuel companies hell-bent on destroying the planet, then the solution is to take on the Man, replace capitalism with something kinder and gentler, and force the fossil fuel companies to shut down. But if it can be blamed on “us”, the answer is not quite so simple. Fossil fuels are used to make and power mobile phones, tablets and laptops. There is no evidence that we want fewer of them. Nor would there be much support for a return to the days before fridges, gas cookers, washing machines and vacuum cleaners. Smoking in a restaurant or bar is no longer socially acceptable; until the same applies to driving your son or daughter to school in a gas-guzzling 4x4, Helm is right: we are not very serious about climate change. This is one of the reasons why the deep-green approach to climate change is fraught with difficulty. The fossil fuel companies are in business because we want the products that fossil fuels make and power. It is not just a question of supply, but also a question of demand, which is why many people now have more than one smartphone and lust after the Apple watch. Does this make us any happier? Well, according to Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, economists at the University of Michigan in the US, the evidence is that wellbeing rises with income, and that the satiation point has yet to be reached, even in the richest countries. The experience of the past few years would appear to support the Stevenson-Wolfers argument: the idea that, above a certain level of prosperity, there is no link between happiness and income has yet to be tested in a period when living standards have been flatlining. But there is little evidence so far that the public is wildly keen on the idea that they are becoming worse off. The second problem with the deep-green approach is that even assuming rich people in the west could be persuaded to curb their consumption, it would not stop CO2 emissions from rising. That is because the real growth in energy demand from now on is going to come from the developing world. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa are home to around 630 million people with no electricity. Apart from the impact on households, power shortages are holding back growth and job creation. Firms have to depend on costly generators, which makes goods more expensive. Outside of South Africa, coal is a small part of the power story. Africa is far greener than the UK, the US or Germany, largely because of hydroelectric power in countries such as Ethiopia. Its carbon footprint is tiny. Again leaving South Africa to one side, the average person in sub-Saharan Africa consumes the same amount of energy in a month as the average Briton does in a day, according to Kevin Watkins, director of the UK’s Overseas Development Institute. Without question, Africa’s energy consumption is going to rise. It has abundant reserves of coal – the most damaging of the fossil fuels – and nations such as Angola and Nigeria are significant oil exporters. One option would be to skip fossil fuels entirely and move straight to renewables, especially solar energy, but Watkins says that this is too expensive for most countries to contemplate. “Achieving universal access and a tenfold increase in power generation will take huge domestic investments and a big international financing effort.” So, there is a choice. The rest of the world can help poor African countries with the cost of developing renewable energy; the rest of the world can provide Africa with expensive carbon capture and storage for coal-fired power stations; or the rest of the world can do nothing and watch Africa’s carbon footprint rise rapidly as it burns dirty fossil fuels. There is no status quo option. India provides another example of the policy choices facing countries in the emerging world. Given the dreadful air quality in Delhi, the government led by Narendra Modi is well aware of the threat of climate change and has announced ambitious plans to increase solar power. But it also wants to ensure that every Indian citizen has access to electricity, and believes that can only be achieved by expanding coal power at the same time as it is expanding solar power. Watkins believes western governments and environmental NGOs would be better off mobilising finance for a programme of carbon capture and storage in India than offering Modi advice about the perils of climate change. The third difficulty with the anti-growth approach is that growth is part of the solution to climate change. Most growth is the result of innovation – the development of new products, new techniques and new ways of doing things that are an improvement on what went before. Since the middle of the 18th century, there have been successive waves of technical progress: coal and steam, railways and the internal combustion engine at the end of the 19th century; the mid-20th-century age of consumer durables and commercial air travel. The next wave looks like it will be dominated by digital technology, robotics, biotech, lighter materials and renewable energy. Nicholas Stern, who authored a 2006 report on the economics of climate change commissioned by then-chancellor Gordon Brown, says stopping growth misses the point. The possibilities opened up by this new wave of technology, he believes, provide hope that growth can be decarbonised over the decades to come. “To say that we have to stop growing – that we have to go backwards – I think is factually wrong, and also politically unlikely to be successful.” Even if the world called a halt to economic expansion now, he adds, carbon emissions would continue rising and the world would be looking at an increase in global temperatures of 3-4C. “We absolutely can have growth and protection of the climate at the same time, and in doing so we will construct a much better form of economic activity and growth in terms of clean air, less-congested cities and so on,” Stern says. “If we say the only way to handle this is to stop growing, we will be factually wrong, because if we stopped growing but didn’t break the relationship between activity and emissions, we wouldn’t be tackling climate change.” In reality, only the deepest greens are opposed to all forms of growth. The Green party in the UK wants to grow the NHS and education; it wants a bigger budget for social care and a higher minimum wage. Tim Jackson of the University of Surrey, author of Prosperity Without Growth, says we need fewer resource-intensive activities that damage the climate, but more of the services that improve the quality of people’s lives. Like Stern, he is not really talking about replacing the economics of “more” with the economics of “less”; he is suggesting replacing it with the economics of “better”. There are only three ways of reducing our carbon footprint: reduce the amount each person consumes, reduce the number of people, or make each unit of growth less carbon-intensive. Those who want to cut consumption and restrict population growth have the same question to answer: unless you are prepared to use draconian methods, how do you do it? Historical evidence shows there is a link between income and population: as people become richer, they have fewer children. That is why Japan’s population is ageing and shrinking. So if reducing living standards is a political non-starter and repression is spurned as a way of controlling population growth, that leaves reducing the carbon-intensity of growth. “I think it’s extremely simplistic to be pro-growth or anti-growth”, says Helm. “What matters is the sort of growth we choose. Now the underlying driver of economic growth is technical change, and technical change is accelerating. We want technical change, for example, to build new solar technologies. Do the deep greens say, ‘Tell you what, we want to stop the boat now, we don’t want to bother with any more technical change, let’s go back to a more simple society, a more decentralised society, and one that has a smaller footprint on the planet’? I think that’s totally naive.” * * * Even the light green approach is going to be tough, and might not work. The UN is hosting a conference in Paris in late 2015 that will seek commitments to reduce carbon emissions from all the countries attending. As things stand, the offers will fall a long way short of what the experts say is a level consistent with the 2C target – about 12bn tonnes a year, short according to Michael Jacobs. The fossil fuel company BP helpfully provided a ready reckoner in its latest Energy Outlook report for how 2bn tonnes of CO2 emissions could be saved by 2035. It would involve the share of gas used in power generation rising from just over 20% to more than 35%; coal with carbon capture and storage rising from almost zero to just under 10%; renewables increasing from around 5% to just over 20%; and finally, nuclear power almost doubling from just under 10%. The same 2bn tonnes of CO2 could be saved through substantial improvements in energy-efficiency over and above those already expected. Oil, coal and gas currently account for 86% of primary energy, and BP is forecasting only a small decrease, to 81%, by 2035. That is incompatible with the climate change projections made by the International Energy Agency, which thinks fossil fuels should make up no more than two-thirds of the energy mix. BP admits that, on its current projections, emissions will “remain well above the path recommended by scientists”. The IEA also makes the point that it is time the world got its act together. “Delaying action is a false economy: for every $1 of investment in cleaner technology that is avoided in the power sector before 2020, an additional $4.30 would need to be spent after 2020 to compensate for the increased emissions.” Fossil fuels are not going to disappear overnight, but the phasing-out process needs to start immediately, and that process could be hastened if governments used the opportunity provided by the recent halving of global oil prices to remove the $1tn annual subsidies for fossil fuels. It is easy to see why governments, especially those in poorer parts of the world, want to help citizens with their energy bills. But the collapsing cost of crude oil is the equivalent of a tax cut for energy consumers; governments could remove subsidies painlessly in the current climate. The IEA is right: further delay will be costly. Obama could do his bit by making climate change a mission for the US – similar to the way that John F Kennedy vowed to put a man on the moon in the early 1960s. The mission could be to phase out domestic use and export of coal by a fixed date, or to set a deadline for shifting 50% of US energy consumption to renewable sources. Washington could then invite other nations to sign on to the same commitment. That message would be reinforced by putting a price on carbon. This could be achieved in one of two ways: through a carbon tax, or through a cap-and-trade scheme. Either way, it would suggest that governments had started to take seriously what Stern calls one of the greatest market failures in history: the failure to take account of the damage caused by burning fossil fuels. Once shareholders understand that governments are serious about climate change, they will start to look at their investment portfolios. New technologies, particularly those with first‑mover advantage, tend to be profitable, and there will be incentives for pension funds and insurance companies to get their money out of the fossil fuel sector and into a sector that has massive growth potential. On past form, governments will be slower to act than they should be. The lessons from the anti-apartheid and debt-relief campaigns is that divestment can be used to put pressure on governments to act. Politicians move when they know votes are at risk. There are not many votes to be won these days by promising to increase foreign aid, but taxpayers in the west have to realise that poor countries with copious reserves of fossil fuels are going to exploit them, and that one way of mitigating the impact is to transfer to them the latest technology. The exploitation of fossil fuels in the developing world is only going to be reduced if financial assistance is offered. The amount of money currently allocated by international bodies, such as the UN, for climate change adaptation and mitigation is less than $1bn a year: it needs to be at least 10 times bigger. Unless it is, there will be little point in saying that someone in sub-Saharan Africa can get all the power he or she needs via a solar panel costing as little as $200. After all, the average sub-Saharan African does not have $200 to spare. Success at the Paris conference would be easier if developing countries saw that the west was serious about providing help for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Jacobs says there is little prospect of countries hardening up their commitments between now and December, but it would be progress if there were agreements to tackle particularly damaging forms of climate change, such as deforestation, and to cut emissions to zero in the second half of the century. But that does not mean that we can afford to wait until the second half of the century to make the transition to non‑fossil-fuel energy. Building up the necessary infrastructure is going to be a long and expensive process, which should be encouraged through public procurement, tax incentives and a big increase in R&amp;D budgets. The stone age did not end because of a shortage of stone. The fossil fuel age will end either when there are newer, better and cleaner ways of providing energy, or when it is too late to prevent irreparable damage to the planet. Renewable technology is moving on apace. Investment in clean energy is growing at a double-digit rate. That is the good news. The bad news is that renewables will still only meet around 20% of energy demand by 2035, even using optimistic assumptions about future growth rates. That is going to require some tough decisions and some compromises. Coal is by far the dirtiest of the fossil fuels; it needs to be phased out first, and rapidly. But there is going to be a lag, even on the most optimistic assumptions, before renewables can take the place of coal. “We’re seeing very rapid change”, says Stern, “but we’re going to have to accelerate the arrival and installation and use of renewables, from hydroelectricity and wave power through to the various types of solar. We’re going to have to look more closely at carbon capture and storage, because that’s a way of using your fossil fuels without emitting. And we’re going to have a period when gas is substituted for coal.” Helm agrees. “It’s pretty obvious that we can’t both burn fossil fuels and limit the damage from climate change. There are basically three steps toward getting out of fossil fuels. The first is to make people pay for the consequences of burning fossil fuels, and that’s a carbon tax. The second is the transitionary bit: the only serious way in the next 15-20 years to bear down on coal is to switch from coal to gas. Gas is, of course, a fossil fuel, but it has half the emissions of coal, and we could make substantive cuts – as indeed the US has done – by making the switch. And then, further out, what we need are new technologies.” So what will the world look like in 2043? The future sketched out in The Bone Clocks is only fiction. It does not have to be that way. We could be living through the green technological revolution, in which energy has been decarbonised. Atlanta and Barcelona have the same number of people and share the same per-capita incomes, but Atlanta’s carbon emissions are 10 times those of Barcelona. We need more Barcelonas and fewer Atlantas, because that will encourage us to change the way we live: walking more, using public transport more, sharing cars, cycling. All of this is important, because ultimately Helm is right. This is not just about carbon taxes. It is not just about R&amp;D. It is not just about divestment. If we really want the fossil fuels to be left in the ground, it is about us. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jul/09/nuclear-power-energy-secrecy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-09T07:30:00Z","webTitle":"How not to solve nuclear power's trust problem | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jul/09/nuclear-power-energy-secrecy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jul/09/nuclear-power-energy-secrecy","fields":{"headline":"How not to solve nuclear power's trust problem","bodyText":"The public does not trust the government to be objective on nuclear power, a committee of MPs conclude today. This is hardly surprising, as the MPs note: \"The government's position as an advocate for nuclear power makes it difficult for the public to trust it as an impartial source of information .. While around half the population supported this, it appeared to be a reluctant support for the least worst option, or a 'Devil's bargain'.\" More transparency would help, to let the light into industry still inclined to secrecy, thanks to its historic ties to the military and nuclear weapons. You would think that the desire for openess would burn ever more fiercely given the fallout from the Fukushima nuclear catastrophe in Japan. The meltdowns were the result \"of collusion between the government, the regulators and [energy company] Tepco, and the lack of governance by said parties,\" said the official report, released on Thursday. \"They effectively betrayed the nation's right to be safe from nuclear accidents. Therefore, we conclude that the accident was clearly 'man-made'.\" So what to make of the pathetically, almost hilariously, bland \"summary of minutes\" released to me by the government's new Nuclear Research and Development Advisory Board (NRDAB) meeting? Barely 150 words long, they reveal nothing whatsoever of substance of the meetings, chaired by the government chief scientist Sir John Beddington, lots of officials and academics and one energy company. No prizes for guessing the latter, given they already have staff planted within government: it's EDF, the French state owned nuclear giant, who are the only serious players left who might build the government's yearned for new nuclear plants. You can read the summary minutes from 27 March here and 24 April here. The NDRAB was set up this year to advise the government on a long-term strategy for nuclear energy, including \"the important role that nuclear research and development plays in the UK, helping to underpin the performance and safety cases of operational plants.\" One would think after the \"collusion\" between the nuclear industry and the government that followed the Fukushima disaster, where official sought PR advice on how to play down the catastrophe, that continued secrecy would be deemed counterproductive. It seems not. Perhaps the government simply accepts no-one will ever trust it on nuclear power. The MPs report suggests raising the public profile of the independent nuclear regulators to \"engender public trust and influence risk perceptions\". The institutional groupthink is such that the committee doesn't even consider the most obvious way to way \"engender trust\": not building new nuclear power stations. Instead they have a different, even more startling, proposal: \"We were impressed by a citizen partnership model being developed in Germany for wind farms and suggest that enabling communities to feel more ownership of local energy infrastructure by offering shares in projects could be conducive to building trust and acceptance [I agree wholeheartedly, having seen it for myself]. Partnership models could form part of community benefits discussions for new nuclear build and other energy infrastructure.\" So there you have it, community-owned nuclear power stations.

Speaking to Passauer Neue Presse, the German author said: \"I'm 86 now. I don't think I will manage another novel.\" Grass, who won the Nobel in 1999 for his \"frolicsome black fables portray[ing] the forgotten face of history\", added: \"My health does not allow me to take on projects that will last five or six years and that would be the amount needed to research a novel.\" Instead, the author is focusing on drawing and painting with watercolours, he told the regional paper, with some \"first texts\" already emerging from this \"creative activity\". Grass, most famous for his 1959 novel The Tin Drum, and for his revelation in 2006's controversial Peeling the Onion that he joined the Waffen-SS, published a book about the Brothers Grimm in 2010, and another autobiographical title, The Box, in 2008. More recently, he has stoked debate with a poem about Israel, \"What must be said\", in which he wrote that \"Israel's nuclear power is endangering / Our already fragile world peace\". The poem led to Israel barring him from the country for his \"attempt to fan the flames of hatred against the state of Israel and its people, and thus to advance the idea to which he publicly affiliated in his past donning of the SS uniform\". Last month, Grass signed his name to a letter condemning state surveillance following Edward Snowden's revelations. \"A person under surveillance is no longer free; a society under surveillance is no longer a democracy. To maintain any validity, our democratic rights must apply in virtual as in real space,\" wrote Grass and over 500 other signatories to the letter. He also made his views clear on social networking earlier last autumn, telling a Danish website that he was surprised, following Snowden's whistle-blowing, \"that millions of people do not distance themselves from Facebook and all that crap, and say, 'I want no part of it'.\" He is, he said, unimpressed when his children and grandchildren talk about the social networking site. \"I do have certain reservations when one of them tells me 'I am on Facebook [and] have 500 friends'.

The public accounts committee's Progress at Sellafield report blasts the consortium's management for not disclosing the existence of an audit that tracked their failure to meet performance targets, and highlights lax financial controls that let employees bill the taxpayer for hundreds of thousands of pounds in expenses, including £714 on a chauffeur-driven trip for an executive and his family. Sellafield is run by Nuclear Management Partners – a consortium made up of URS, Areva and Amec – which is answerable to the government's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. The consortium had its contract to run the Cumbria plant – which is responsible for decommissioning, reprocessing and nuclear waste – extended last year, but has been dogged by criticism over its performance. The overall value of the 17-year-contract is put at around £70bn and the committee's chair, Margaret Hodge, has questioned whether taxpayers are getting value for money. She expressed anger that a £250,000 audit by consultants KPMG, analysing a series of missed performance targets at Sellafield, had not been shared with her committee. The audit was in the possession of the Department of Energy and Climate Change, but its existence was not disclosed to the committee, even though it was paid for by the taxpayer and its findings were important evidence. It was only when a member of the public obtained a copy and shared it with the committee last year that the consortium behind Sellafield acknowledged its existence. Upon reading the KPMG report, Hodge said one of its conclusions was that \"taxpayers lost money while your shareholders have, no doubt, made a good buck out of this, and it is not very satisfactory\". She added: \"We wait to see whether the situation improves. It would be nice if there was an apology for the lost millions to the British taxpayer – I do not know whether you feel able to do that. I have to say to you that I am sceptical as to whether, after five years on the site, you can really improve your performance.\" Another committee member, Guto Bebb, described comments in the report about the leadership and management of the project as the \"most damning I have seen\". Continuing failures at Sellafield, where staff were recently asked to stay at home because of heightened levels of radioactivity, will be a significant concern for the government, which is keen to develop a new generation of nuclear power plants. Ministers need to have a plan for where the plants' waste will be processed and stored before they are built and Sellafield is the most likely candidate.

No one forgets a gifted decoder of AQA mark schemes. • Congratulate any students you come across on their hard work and perseverance, whatever politicians try to say about standards and boundary slippage. Resist the temptation to be drawn into debates arguing that A-level physics in the 1970s involved redesigning nuclear power plants, for a bare pass, whereas now you essentially get an A* for having a rudimentary grasp of billiards. Instead, consider that while 1,094,000 young people aged 16-18 were studying on full-time programmes in state-funded post-16 institutions at the end of 2013, around 148,000 were not in education, training or employment at all. A new focus on their experience, and future, is needed. • Prevent a mature applicant being put off university by pictures of impossibly photogenic youths engaging in over-choreographed, synchronised leaping as they wave their result sheets mid-air like the handkerchiefs of some Red Bull-fuelled Morris dancers. Mature students now make up a third of all undergraduates and on many courses are in the majority. Point out that if they become a full-time student and have at least one child, they might be eligible for up to £1,523 through the parents' learning allowance scheme and a grant for up to 85% of the costs of childcare up to the value of £257.55 per week. Additionally, there's the possibility of an adult dependants' grant if their partner is earning less than £3,796. • Annoy someone, ideally a Russell Group admissions tutor, by pointing out that only 1.3% of media studies students get an A*, compared to nearly 30% of those taking an A-level in further maths. Don't concede the point on vastly different self-selection processes here until well into the third round (of drinks, that is, not boxing). When they say: \"But you can't take that figure at face value, one needs to put it into context\" ask them: \"Should we interpret context idiosyncratically or systematically?\" When they say: \"Systematically, of course,\" ask what their position is on a systematic approach to contextual data in undergraduate admissions. Duck. • Like so many early blooming red, yellow and blue clematis, MPs pop up in mid-August on results day to tweet breathlessly congratulatory comments such as,\"Well done to all our local schools, colleges and pupils for their wonderful results today! Feel so proud!\" Take the opportunity to ask such MPs if they were equally vocal in opposing the abolition of free university education, adult FE grants, the education maintenance allowance, AimHigher, Sure Start centres or the reduction in the disabled students' allowance. • Ask a local television station whether having bleary-eyed sixth-formers open their results live on air at 8am really is socially responsible broadcasting. If the unfortunate student is genuinely unaware of their results, then having some one discover live on TV whether two years of work that bridges the next 40 years of living, learning and working is a triumph or disaster, for the amusement of largely indifferent, Froot Loop-eating viewers, is reprehensible. If they already know their results and have been seduced into colluding in an exercise of media deception for the sake of entertainment, that's also unwelcome. • Don't glibly use the phrase \"triumph or disaster\" in relation to A-level results, even for comic effect. • Set aside time in your day for the emails, phone calls, Facebook messages, Twitter DMs and cold-call house visits from relatives, neighbours and casual acquaintances so you can help them brief their baffled and bewildered 18-year-olds, who have just received their results, and, you know you work in education don't you, what should he do next and what do AS12, Adjustment Period, Ucas Track CO1, UMS, UCC all mean and how many points for a B and could you just write all that down, and don't mean to rush you but we're calling Keele at 3pm. • Update your notes on Burke's aphorism: \"Those who don't know history are destined to repeat it.\" Only in the June diet of examinations, the January resit for history now having been abolished. • Speak up when your local radio station, newspaper, website or social media feed poses the phoney contrast: \"Didn't get the grades? Maybe uni isn't for you? Why not start your own business instead? Remember, Richard Branson never went to university!\" Point out that universities in the UK collectively have the largest infrastructure in Europe to support new businesses for young and new entrepreneurs. Point out there are currently over 8,000 active university-driven graduate startups employing more than 15,000 full-time equivalent staff with a combined turnover north of £350m per annum (Hefce, HE-BCI survey 2012-13). • Think about becoming a school governor. Though, as Michael Gove pointed out, \"The thing about being a governor is that it's not just a touchy-feely, sherry-pouring, cake-slicing exercise in hugging each other and singing Kumbayah\". Which is a shame really as, for many, that was quite a seductive prospectus. • Be wary of media coverage that indicates without qualification that \"numbers attending university are greater than ever\". The picture for mature students and part-time students is very different: Hefce's April 2014 report indicates a fall of 50% in part-time numbers since 2010-11, attributable – they say – to the contraction of public-sector employment, where many part-time students are based, and the reluctance of employers to pay fees. In addition, postgraduate numbers are in decline, an area where there is already a social participation gap, now exacerbated by reductions in funding for taught masters. • And finally, spare a thought for all the admissions tutors and other university and college academic, professional and administrative staff, student helpers and press officers who will be up early on results day and working flat-out for a week.

But the inquiry, triggered last week by a trio of watchdogs led by Ofgem and to be undertaken by the new Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) immediately sparked dire warnings that go to the heart of Britain's energy policy paralysis. British Gas owner Centrica and a raft of analysts said a probe that could last two years will freeze investment in much-needed power stations and make blackouts more likely. Ofgem and energy and climate change secretary Ed Davey countered that a proper and full investigation would clear the air and rebuild trust among consumers. But it will take more than a competition probe to restore faith in British energy policy. There are six questions the energy industry needs to answer as it tackles the wider issue of how Britain can modernise and decarbonise its power industry without pushing up prices and driving vast numbers of people into fuel poverty. What do we do about the big six? It is highly unlikely that Margaret Thatcher, the political cheerleader for deregulation and privatisation, envisaged a world where the state-owned Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and the 12 regional English electricity boards would end up almost entirely in the hands of the largely foreign-owned companies we now know as the big six. She would surely have blanched at the idea that a state-owned French company, Electricité de France (EDF), would hold major stakes in the supply sector and own most of the former CEGB's nuclear power stations. British Gas was privatised in 1986 and has remained in UK hands but nearly 30 years later still controls 40% of the gas market, plus a further 25% of the electricity supply. The privatised firms took over an industry which had seen plenty of investment, so the new owners felt able to concentrate on cost-cutting and neglect the building of new plants. This continued until they were encouraged to \"dash for gas\", building plants that eventually undermined the coal- and nuclear-powered stations to a point where the privatised British Energy – now part of EDF – had to be given a £3bn state bailout. Power generating companies are no longer strictly separate from energy suppliers, which has allowed the big six to colonise and dominate both sectors, and stop new entrants expanding, say independent suppliers. Regulator Ofgem has only recently begun trying in earnest to reform the sector, fining companies for breaking their licence agreements, be it for mis-selling, poor handling of complaints, or overcharging. In the meantime a key measure of a healthy market – customers switching from one supplier to another – has failed to take root, while collective prices – and profits – have risen. Customers have been infuriated by ever higher bills – pushed up by rising wholesale power prices, plus the cost of subsidising low-carbon energy projects such as windfarms – and politicians have been goaded into promises of action. The Big Six have always argued that they are working harder than ever to increase efficiency, keep bills down and provide good customer service. They largely attribute the collapse in customer trust to others. They see themselves as an easy media whipping boy and the scapegoat of successive governments' unwillingness to explain to the public that the need to modernise and decarbonise the energy industry means higher prices whoever runs it. Some of them now see the competition inquiry as a chance to tell their side of the story. How do we ensure energy security? Most observers agree there is a need for more power stations in this country, be they gas-, nuclear- or wind-powered – gas plants have been mothballed or closed even as surplus capacity has dwindled. The Department of Energy and Climate Change has spoken of the need for £100bn of new investment to cope with the coal-fired power stations that are being driven offline by new environmental regulations, or the many nuclear facilities which are coming to the end of their lives. The state-owned CEGB, praised in 1983 by then-parliamentary under secretary of state the Earl of Avon as a \"success story\", could perhaps stand accused of overengineering and overcautiousness. It used to keep many power plants on standby and at one stage had 25% surplus capacity margins. That figure is now down to just 5%, which has led to fears about blackouts. The need to tackle climate change means carbon-intensive oil and coal-fired stations must be phased out unless a largely unproven and expensive system of carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be rapidly introduced. Meanwhile wind, solar and nuclear systems still require heavy subsidies to make them competitive, at a time when the country foresees huge future demand for electricity as it tries to move transport away from petrol-powered to electric cars. And all of this is comes at a time when our own North Sea oil and gas production is in fast decline. But the best way of reducing the scale of the action needed is by reducing demand for power. Energy-efficiency can do this via well-insulated domestic households or less energy-intensive ways of doing business. To frack or not to frack? Hardline environmentalists would rule out shale gas extraction, on the grounds that it would keep Britain dependent on fossil fuels and stifle investment in low-carbon power. But many observers believe locally produced and lower-carbon shale would increase energy security and could be used to buy the time required move away from oil and coal. Successful shale gas exploitation has had a dramatic impact on the energy scene in America, driving down domestic gas prices and triggering a new manufacturing boom. But Britain is at a very early stage, with little knowledge yet about how easy or lucrative it would be to get at the reserves that are believed to lie beneath regions such as Bowland, Lancashire. David Cameron said last week that a shale gas industry could beat off any threat by Vladimir Putin to use Siberian gas as a political weapon. But it could take years to get a UK shale industry running profitably, and even Lord Browne, chairman of shale pioneer Cuadrilla Resources, believes it would have little impact on prices. What about the nuclear option? Nuclear power plants should be able to run at full capacity almost all the time – unlike wind or solar, which are weather-dependent. A number of new investors have come forward with plans to build new reactors on the sites of existing plants. Hinkley Point C, proposed by EDF in Somerset, would generate 3,200MW, single-handedly supplying almost 7% of the country's electricity. That compares with 630MW of intermittent energy from the world's biggest offshore wind farm, the London Array off the coast of Kent. But EDF has been granted huge subsidies to build the low-carbon plant, which may yet be deemed in breach of competition policy by the European Commission. The building of new reactors in France and Finland is running way over time and budget, and the issue of radioactive waste remains unresolved. Will the lights go out? The list of organisations and business leaders who have warned that Britain is heading for an energy crunch somewhere between now and 2020 is long and distinguished and includes Ofgem, the National Grid and, most recently, Centrica. People have been predicting power failures for more than 10 years, but Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of the British Gas parent group, repeated the warning last week as the CMA inquiry was announced. Ofgem and Ed Davey insist that the competition investigation will make investment easier, because it will come to a clear conclusion about whether the energy companies have been profiteering, and how a market that appears to keep new entrants out – or at least stop them expanding – can be restructured. So will there be blackouts this time around? What is more likely is higher prices, as Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at the University of Oxford and a former government adviser, told parliament in 2006: \"People think insecurity of supply means will the lights go off, but that is not the issue. It is what happens just before the lights go off. It is volatility and sharp price rises.\" Even if the big six are found guilty of profiteering and face fines, break-ups or other sanctions, the fact remains that the private sector will not invest in new low-carbon plants without significant subsidies. It is unsustainable to keep loading the cost directly on to consumers through energy bills, as this hits the lowest-paid and most needy. The taxpayer is the obvious candidate to foot more of the bill, but this requires the government to be more open about the challenge ahead, and adjust its spending priorities accordingly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2014/aug/10/boris-johnson-10-things-to-do","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-09T23:05:00Z","webTitle":"Boris, here are 10 things you can do for London in the next year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/10/boris-johnson-10-things-to-do","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/aug/10/boris-johnson-10-things-to-do","fields":{"headline":"Boris, here are 10 things you can do for London in the next year","bodyText":"Alexandra Jones Chief executive for Centre for Cities Speed up investment in fast broadband, especially in areas with creative businesses. Boris already has an ambitious \"Smart London\" plan. Now he has to deliver all those commitments, including affordable ultrafast broadband. Set up a London Innovation Lab whose remit is to identify, pilot and help roll out \"smart\" innovations. That could be anything from Santander's air-quality monitors or Boston's Citizens Connect app for reporting local problems such as graffiti or damaged signs. Esther Rantzen, CBE Founder of ChildLine and The Silver Line Adopt the New York City Bench scheme , and allow 1,000 Londoners a year to choose where to place a bench paid for by the GLA and by donations. I know it works. As I wander around Hampstead Heath I always read the names carved on the backs of the benches. It may be narcissistic of me, but I would love future generations to pause as they stroll along the banks of the Thames and relax on a bench which is named after me. I hope they will be joined on the bench by other Londoners and maybe make new friends. It's one way to combat the loneliness that abounds in our overcrowded city. Satish Kumar Editor-in-chief of Resurgence &amp; Ecologist magazine Installing solar panels on every Londoner's roof, and improving home insulation, could trim 20% off our soaring domestic fuel bills, cut pollution and carbon emissions, and help boost the capital's environmental reputation, as well as that of the mayor's. Britain is facing an energy crisis which burning expensive imported gas or proposing cripplingly expensive – and politically divisive – nuclear power stations won't solve. Now that a majority of the world's population lives in cities, our capital should be leading the way in sustainable, decentralised ways of living. And while you're up there, Boris, how about some schemes to encourage rooftop gardening? We should be growing more of our own food, too. Rowan Moore Architecture critic When elected, Johnson promised he would reverse Ken Livingstone's fondness for permitting tall buildings, that he would not allow a \"Dubai on Thames\". On this he has executed a perfect U-turn, except that it is an insult to Dubai to compare it to the mediocrity of the 200-plus towers now in the pipeline in London. His excuse is that London faces a severe housing shortage. But there is no evidence that flats in residential skyscrapers are the answer to the city's needs. In his remaining time he can enforce existing policies on the quality and location of towers more seriously. He can review London's ramshackle apparatus of planning provisions on height, with a view to their reform. He can create a digital model of the city so that Londoners can see what is proposed for it. He can appoint a commission of people who know about urban design to help him with all of the above. David Robinson Founder of Change London Create 1,000 weekend play streets and show a mayoral determination to make London the greatest city in the world to bring up a child. Astonishingly, roads make up 80% of our public space in London and we have surrendered them almost entirely to the car. Busy streets mean fewer chats over the wall, fewer impromptu gatherings and fewer children playing out and drawing adults in. It is no coincidence that cul-de-sacs sustain the highest levels of social cohesion vital to health and happiness. At 30 streets per borough, a target of 1,000 play streets is eminently achievable, as the trailblazers in Bristol and Hackney have shown. Samantha Heath Chief executive, London Sustainability Exchange Tackle London's air pollution problem. An estimated 4,000 Londoners every year die prematurely from causes related to air pollution, which contributes to myriad health problems, including strokes, heart and lung diseases. Children are particularly at risk because of their smaller lung capacity. In parts of London air pollution can be up to four times higher than the EU limit in areas such as bus stops, built-up areas, under bridges and where traffic is often at a standstill. Meanwhile, the EU has launched legal action against both France and the UK on account of its dangerously poor air quality. London's mayor, via cleaning up taxis and buses, strengthening planning regulation and logistics centres to aid zero-emission deliveries, could help to give London much cleaner air over the next 12 months. Alison Garnham, chief executive, Child Poverty Action Group London has the highest rate of child poverty in the UK, with almost four in 10 children in the capital living in poverty. This is partly because the city's job market is not working for mothers. Employment rates for women with children in London are 12 percentage points lower than the national average. Boris Johnson has huge influence with employers , who could be encouraged or incentivised to offer high-quality part-time or flexible jobs. He could make it easier for parents to access and afford childcare, including a pan-London information service, and help with the upfront costs and deposits. Will King Founder of King of Shaves Heathrow was in the right place, at the right time. Having flown into many airports around the world, what strikes me is how \"small\" Heathrow is, compared with the airports in, for instance, Shanghai or Hong Kong. And right now small does not attract big. Britain is great at carrying out innovative strategic infrastructure projects – Eurotunnel, for example. So why don't we build the coolest airport in the world, in the coolest city in the world, in a part of Greater London which isn't \"way out\" – as is the case with Stansted or Gatwick? Philip Colligan Executive director, Innovation Lab Nesta Offer prizes for innovation to help entrepreneurs create products and services that could be sold to cities around the world. Boris should also use the GLA's huge estate and land holdings to provide more of the flexible, low-cost space that start-up businesses need, alongside supporting the accelerator programmes that help them flourish. Duwayne Brooks Director of Active Community Engagement and Development Trust in the Met in some boroughs is at an all time low. Building on the work of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, Boris should promote local road shows with senior officers and publish regular figures on local incidents, arrests and numbers charged. I want Boris to publicly reward the great and good at the Met, to champion how this wonderful city is policed 24 hours a day, to remind the public there is no them and us. •This article was amended on 11 August 2014 to correct the name of the London Sustainability Exchange."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/blog/2012/feb/01/nuclear-power-carbon-emissions-target","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-01T17:33:30Z","webTitle":"Can the UK achieve its carbon targets without nuclear power? | Leo Hickman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/blog/2012/feb/01/nuclear-power-carbon-emissions-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/blog/2012/feb/01/nuclear-power-carbon-emissions-target","fields":{"headline":"Can the UK achieve its carbon targets without nuclear power?","bodyText":"10.26am: A new report, which has attracted cross-party support, is claiming that the government's decision in favour of nuclear power was \"corrupted\" by \"false\" information. Corruption of Governance? (pdf) was jointly written by Unlock Democracy and the Association for the Conservation of Energy and it argues that \"this corruption of governance can only be rectified if Parliament re-opens this debate, and MPs vote on this issue having seen the correct information\". One of the report's central arguments is that, according to the government's own figures, \"there is absolutely no need for any more nuclear power stations to deliver energy security ('keep the lights on') and achieve 80% reductions in carbon dioxide by 2050\". In part, it says that this is down to the fact that the government stated that the UK's electricity supply will need to \"double or even triple\" in order to achieve a low-carbon economy. But the report states that this was based on flawed information and assumptions about electricity \"needs\" by 2025 and beyond. It led to some contorted thinking, it adds: The [government's] pre-determined policy of [needing] 10 new nuclear power stations created the 'central assumption' of the need for them. Rather than the need driving the policy, the policy dictated the so-called need. The report also criticises the government's assessment of its own \"pathways\" to achieving an 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. In six of the 16 different pathways put forward by the government last year, nuclear power was according \"level 1 activity\", or, translated, \"little or no action\". The six such scenarios were described as: \"Biofuels: solid\"; \"Renewables emphasis\"; \"Offshore emphasis\"; \"CCS emphasis\"; \"Gas emphasis\"; and \"Microgeneration\". Compounding the problem, says the report, is that the government displays a \"continued refusal to asses the potential for energy savings\". On page 15 of the report (pdf), you can see its summary of the \"false information\" it says has led the government to conclude that it cannot \"keep the lights on\" and achieve its emissions reductions targets by 2050. It then describes it own suggested pathways, all of them with \"little or no action\" on nuclear power. They are too detailed to summarise here, but you can view its assumptions in \"Appendix 2\" on page 30-31 (pdf). (It should be noted, I feel, that despite the report declaring at the beginning that it \"is published by two organisations that are not formally opposed to nuclear power\", the authors, Ron Bailey and Lotte Blair, are part of No Need for Nuclear.) In December, the Department of Energy and Climate Change published an open-source \"2050 pathways calculator\" which allowed any user to design their own \"cost-optimised scenarios\". It ended up generating a lot of heat and attention, but at least it allowed the public to better interrogate the \"assumptions\" the new Corruption of Governance? report is keen to criticise. We should, therefore, now have the information to hand to try and answer the headline question: can we really do without nuclear power? But what are your own thoughts and conclusions? If quoting figures to support your points, please provide a link to the source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. And later on today, I will return with my own verdict. 11.18am: Last December, the European Commission published its \"Energy Roadmap 2050\". It, too, set out various pathways for meeting the EU's \"decarbonisation objective\" of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to \"80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050\". In \"scenario 6\" (pdf) it described how this could be achieved with \"low nuclear\": Nuclear developments depend on policy assumptions taken and ranges from 2 to 18% share in primary energy consumption. The share of gas is the highest in Low nuclear scenario with significant CCS penetration. Oil and solids decline. Electricity share in final energy consumption doubles from current levels and electricity become the most important final energy source. It also adds that the low nuclear scenario has the \"highest prices by 2030\". Go to page 38 of this pdf for a full breakdown of the assumptions upon which all the scenarios are based. 11.43am: Last October, WWF published its \"Positive Energy\" report (pdf). It, too, set out a range of scenarios for achieving \"near decarbonisation\" of the power sector by 2030 without any new nuclear power stations. It explains each scenario in detail from page 26 onwards. Of the four main scenarios, WWF's preferred future electricity system is scenario B2. This scenario includes high levels of ambition for reducing demand and creating interconnection with Europe, and the lowest capital costs. Scenarios B1 and B2 also need much smaller gas generation capacity than the A1 and A2 scenarios. This reduces the risk of the UK building surplus long-lasting gas generation infrastructure, which might require subsidy to operate at low load factors (as required in the A scenarios) or risk locking the UK into carbon intensive generation infrastructure. However, as made clear in the additional stretch scenarios C1 and C2, there is scope for renewables to provide much more than a 60% share of UK electricity...The level of renewable energy deployment envisaged in all scenarios will require bold policies to encourage investment in the UK's renewable energy industry. It points out that nuclear has \"spiralling costs\" and that, even though carbon capture and storage for gas is necessary in most scenarios, again the costs are uncertain. But, I wonder, does building extra \"interconnectors\" to continental Europe, as WWF calls for, mean that the UK becomes increasingly reliant on, say, France's nuclear energy? 12.28pm: More scenarios to consider. This time from the German government, which said last year, of course, that it intended to phase out all its nuclear power plants by 2022. Here's what its Federal Environment Agency said in 2010: Germany's electricity supply could make a complete switch to renewable energies by 2050. The technology already available on the market could make this possible even today, but it requires that electricity be used and produced very efficiently... The Federal Environment Agency explores the conversion to a 100% renewable energies power supply in three basic scenarios. The study now published is based on the 'region´s network' scenario, in which all the regions in Germany largely tap their potentials to use renewable energies and a country-wide electricity conversion results. Only a very small share of electricity would then need to be imported from neighbouring countries...The power supply switch requires that renewable energies, networks and storage systems be expanded large-scale. Furthermore, the means to save electricity must also be used to the fullest extent. The insulation of buildings must be greatly improved so as not to consume too much power to supply their heating. Load management potentials must also be developed in order to better adapt demand for electricity to fluctuating supply, especially from wind and solar energy. And here's the English version (thanks @EcoPilgrim and @geschichtenpost for finding it) of the report (pdf) it published last May called \"Restructuring electricity supply in Germany\": According to Federal Environment Agency estimates, Germany is able to phase out nuclear energy entirely after 2017. In addition to the construction of power stations in progress, there will be further capacity demand of 5 GW at the most, which can be met by new, highly flexible and highly efficient natural gas cogeneration or combined cycle plants, and partly by stepped up expansion of renewable energies as well as additional energy efficiency measures, or through measures to extend the service life of existing power stations. 12.46pm: I have received a comment from Ron Bailey, one of the report's authors, addressing remarks below the line about the report's claims of neutrality on nuclear energy: Your correspondents seem to be focusing on the wrong question. The report did not make a definitive case either for or against new nuclear. The point it made was that Ministers and Parliament were provided with incorrect information on which to base their decisions. The information that they were provided with was an incorrect summary of the information held by the \"government machine\". That is the point made by the report and anyone should be concerned at that, whether they support or oppose new nuclear. Because it constitutes a corruption of governance and an undermining of democracy. 2.46pm: I've just received this reaction from a spokesman at the Department of Energy and Climate Change: We need a range of new energy infrastructure to keep the lights on and reduce our carbon emissions in a secure and affordable way. The UK has everything to gain from becoming a leading destination to invest in new nuclear. This will come alongside investment in other technologies like renewables, clean coal and gas, and improved energy efficiency. We are confident that the Energy National Policy Statements - which will inform decisions on building new infrastructure - are robust documents which took account of all relevant factors. 3.08pm: I've just received this response from Dr David Clarke, chief executive of the Energy Technologies Institute, a \"public-private partnership between global industries and the UK Government\": It is certainly possible to create a future energy system capable of meeting our 2050 targets without nuclear energy. It wouldn't, however, be the most secure, affordable or sustainable system for UK consumers. Affordability must be a key consideration. Although new nuclear stations have a high initial cost, our own peer-reviewed UK modelling system, ESME – Energy System Modelling Environment – shows that in order to keep long-term costs down, nuclear will have to be part of the mix along with more efficient homes, carbon capture and storage, bio energy and offshore wind. Without all of these elements – including nuclear – all of the energy system scenarios we have looked at simply come with too high a price tag to be realistic. 3.23pm: Some comments that have been sent via Twitter: @Cycling_CB official French study shows that electricity from new nuclear stations is more expensive than windmills http://www.lesechos.fr/entreprises-secteurs/energie-environnement/actu/0201873018509-la-competitivite-du-nucleaire-rabotee-par-la-cour-des-comptes-282687.php @victoria_plumb sure you've already heard of historian Gabrielle Hecht - has interesting perspective on nuclear &amp; politics www-personal.umich.edu/~hechtg/ @noorhal if Severn Tidal Power scheme is reviewed again, no need for nuclear power. @iresustain we wrote an interesting piece on this debate recently - take a look http://industryre.com/2012/01/phasing-out-nuclear-energy-is-costly-lengthy-and-could-see-carbon-emissions-rise/ @JosOlivier Can the #Netherlands achieve 80% #GHG reduction in #2050 without #nuclear power?

See the Pathways Calculator tool on the DECC website. DECC may like new nuclear power stations; they may want them - but to claim that we NEED them to keep the lights on and achieve carbon targets is belied by their own evidence as the report shows and the Pathways calculator shows. By repeating false claims they are only serving to further corrupt governance. As the song asks: When will they ever learn? 5.04pm: Professor David MacKay, DECC's chief scientific advisor who designed its 2050 Pathways Calculator, has now posted his response below the line. He concludes: No-nuclear pathways are certainly technically possible, but if we do without nuclear, you necessarily need stronger effort in other sectors (eg lifestyle change and demand reduction), which may already be challenging to deliver. Any successful 2050 pathway involves significant change in lots of sectors. Given how difficult it is to be sure that every one of those changes can be delivered, and that the cost reductions we hope for will actually be delivered in all our favourite sectors, I think it is a wise idea to keep our options open, and push hard at a portfolio of demand-reduction and low-carbon-supply options that slightly over-delivers on our targets, so that we we will be robust to one or two failures or disappointments. 5.05pm: My verdict Meeting the government's decarbonisation targets by 2050 without nuclear power is clearly technically possible, as the various scenarios highlighted today display. But, in a way, that's not really the point. The far harder question to answer is whether it is possible politically and financially. I'm not much of a gambler. Hence, I heartily agree with Professor David MacKay that is a \"wise idea to keep our options open\". I have always favoured as broad an energy mix as can be delivered, with an emphasis on phasing out the most carbon-intensive sources of energy - most notably coal - as fast as we can. It also seems wise to work hard to reduce demand and increase efficiencies, wherever possible. But I think we need to be realistic about what is achievable. In the short- to mid-term, I really cannot see per capita electricity consumption falling in the UK, especially if electric cars become popular in the coming decade or so (still a big if). My beef with nuclear power has always been the dishonesty of its advocates about its unpredictably high construction and legacy costs. But, as with the push to increase our mix of renewables, we have to be honest with ourselves about these costs and square up to them. However, I personally feel there is too much idealism in the argument that we can completely do without nuclear energy. But perhaps the Germanys of this world will prove me wrong?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/aug/02/hiroshima-bombing-70-years-on-eric-schlosser","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-02T07:00:08Z","webTitle":"Hiroshima’s fate, 70 years ago this week, must not be forgotten","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/02/hiroshima-bombing-70-years-on-eric-schlosser","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/aug/02/hiroshima-bombing-70-years-on-eric-schlosser","fields":{"headline":"Hiroshima’s fate, 70 years ago this week, must not be forgotten","bodyText":"In numbers of people killed, the second world war is uncontested in its claim to be the most murderous six years in human history. About 60 million perished in a global conflagration of total warfare. But amid this remorseless carnival of death and destruction, two very different events stand out for their grotesque novelty and their coldly efficient slaughter of civilians: the Holocaust, the world’s first industrialised genocide, and Hiroshima, the world’s first atomic bomb attack, which took place on 6 August 1945, 70 years ago this week. Both cast long shadows over the 20th century and on into the present day. And both raise complex questions about the nature of humanity – that we have within us the capability to organise over several years the systematic extermination of a whole race of people, and also the obliteration of a large populated city in the blink of an eye. Of the two, the Holocaust – unprovoked and unremitting – is unquestionably the greater crime. So monstrous was the methodical murder of 6 million Jews that it’s hard enough to imagine that it took place, let alone that it will ever be repeated. “Never again,” is the near universal consensus. But Hiroshima is another matter. Its mushroom cloud remains a vivid symbol of Promethean hubris, of technology’s grim and uncontrollable potential. And it was repeated, just three days later in Nagasaki. What’s more, many thousands of infinitely more powerful nuclear weapons were subsequently developed and there have been occasions when they have come catastrophically close to being unleashed. Hiroshima is the lesson we must continually relearn if we are to avoid Armageddon. As the author John Hersey wrote: “What has kept the world safe from the bomb since 1945 has not been deterrence, in the sense of fear of specific weapons, so much as it’s been memory. The memory of what happened at Hiroshima.” For those of my generation, when tens of thousands of nuclear warheads were primed for the commencement of the third world war, Hiroshima retains a salutary potency. In my case its relevance was made all the more lasting by the fact that my father visited Hiroshima not long after the bomb was dropped. He was stationed in Japan, just outside Hiroshima, as an 18-year-old soldier shortly after the end of the war, an experience that he revisited with increasing frequency in old age. He spoke of the extraordinary devastation and the silhouettes of objects and even people that were burnt into the pavements in the molten heat of the atomic flash. It sounded like some scorched landscape from science fiction, one that must have been a daunting sight to absorb for a teenager very far from home. That eerie dystopia has never been more intimately captured than in Hersey’s astounding 1946 report for the New Yorker that was later published as a slim, bestselling book entitled simply Hiroshima. Acclaimed in 1999 as the finest piece of American journalism of the 20th century, and often cited as the founding text of the New Journalism, it has just been republished by Penguin in a commemorative issue along with Eric Schlosser’s Gods of Metal, which meticulously documents a 2012 break-in at a nuclear weapons facility in Tennessee. Schlosser cites Hersey’s book as an inspiration. He has read it several times. “I think it’s one of the greatest works of non-fiction ever written,” he says. “It’s a beautiful piece of writing.” Hersey had been a war correspondent for Life and survived no fewer than four aircraft crashes before following John F Kennedy through the Solomon Islands. In Japan, reporting on postwar reconstruction, he came across survivors of Hiroshima and set about writing his famous 31,000-word article which, in an unprecedented feat, would fill a whole New Yorker issue. It begins at 8.15am on 6 August 1945, the moment when the Enola Gay, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, dropped the “Little Boy” atomic bomb over Japan’s eighth-largest city and significant military stronghold, Hiroshima. Hersey then describes the impact on six individuals who survived the explosion. Around 80,000 inhabitants, of whom about a quarter were soldiers, did not survive the initial blast and subsequent fires. A similar number were injured. Exactly how many went on to die over the next year as a result of exposure to radioactivity is not known, though estimates range upwards from 20,000. In plain, unsentimental prose Hersey reports the desperate experiences the six survivors undergo as they encounter women and children horribly burned by the atomic flash, newly blind men whose eyes had melted in the heat of the explosion, and everywhere the oddly polite appeals of the ever-formal Japanese trapped under the rubble of a flattened city. In among the tales of almost unbearable stoicism there are curious and memorable details – for example the pumpkins and potatoes that are dug up, ready cooked from the blast, like the produce of some enormous and hideously indiscriminate microwave oven. In the main hospital there is only one active doctor, who works for three days on one hour’s sleep, dressing the wounds of the teeming hordes of the injured and disfigured. One of the six survivors, a young woman who was engaged to be married, is left crippled, untreated and in agonising pain for several days. She never sees her fiance again. It’s impossible to read Hersey’s account without feeling a sense of species shame. And it certainly leaves you in no doubt that such weapons, let alone their modern successors, should never again be used. But of course a finely written account of the conventional bombing of Tokyo that took place in March 1945 would no doubt leave the reader feeling similarly appalled. As many as 100,000 civilians were killed in the massive fire storms that raged across the Japanese capital. Were their deaths more acceptable, less abominable? Distinct from the question of the morality of atomic or nuclear weapons is the question of their utility, though the two are frequently confused. There are many observers who look at the horror inflicted upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki and conclude that not only was it wrong but therefore, almost by definition, unnecessary. This line of thought tends to view the atomic raids on the two cities as if they had little or nothing to do with a desire to end the war with as few casualties – particularly American – as possible. Instead they are seen as a deliberately terrifying exhibition of American military might. Schlosser, who is a seasoned student and critic of nuclear weapons, does not subscribe to this particular school of historical analysis. “The real adamant opponents of nuclear weapons argue that they’ve never had any use whatsoever,” he says, “that they didn’t help to end the second world war, that they didn’t prevent the Soviets from overrunning Europe, and I don’t agree with that. I think that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki probably sped the end of the war. I think that in the absence of nuclear weapons that the Soviet Union would have had hegemony over western Europe.” He points out that the Japanese killed an estimated 1 million Chinese civilians with chemical and biological weapons alone, and altogether killed between “10 and 15 million people in what is now considered an Asian holocaust”. So the Japanese leadership’s willingness to kill was not to be doubted, nor its determination to defend the country against invasion. All of which means that those who say the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki prevented the deaths of hundreds of thousands more soldiers and civilians have, at the least, a respectable point. “But,” adds Schlosser, “I’m not celebrating it or saying it was justified.” Schlosser is best known for his books Fast Food Nation, a searing exposé of America’s food industry, and Reefer Madness, a provocative examination of the US’s black market in sex and drugs. But for the last seven years he’s been researching and writing about America’s nuclear industry. He argues that in the immediate aftermath of the second world war, and in particular as a result of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, America had no appetite for further conflict. “The United States essentially demobilised after the second world war to a degree that is astonishing. We got rid of our tanks, ships, planes, cut defence spending by 90% in the expectation that there would be world peace, and then after the Berlin crisis there was this awareness that we had to defend western Europe or let it go to the Soviets. And the only way to do that was nuclear weapons. Now saying that they have served a role in deterrence doesn’t mean that there’s to be acceptance, because all that came at a high potential price.” In his 2013 book Command and Control he uncovers the many close shaves, accidents and errors that provide a secret and disturbing history of nuclear armaments. In Gods of Metal he looks at several major security breaches, most notably at the Y-2 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, when three religiously motivated trespassers broke into the site and defaced a weapons-grade uranium storage building. As it turned out they were Catholic pacifists, making a peaceful protest against nuclear weapons. But what if their religious motivation had taken a more aggressive form? And that instead of spraying the walls of the storage site with antiwar slogans, they had blown open those walls and gained access to the large quantities of uranium-235, the fissile material needed to generate a nuclear weapon’s apocalyptic power? Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war, the prospect of humanity’s self-inflicted oblivion has subsided, at least in our anxious preoccupations. The impossibly mammoth nuclear arsenal that east and west had aimed at each other has shrunk from around 70,000 warheads to the 16,000 that are now thought to be maintained by the nine nuclear-armed nations: United States, Russia, United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea. In the 1980s, when the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament was at its height, there was much talk about MAD, the fitting acronym for the military doctrine that provided the logic for nuclear deterrence: mutually assured destruction. What prevented one side from launching its weapons was the knowledge that the other would retaliate in kind, meaning that both would be annihilated, along with the rest of us. That outlook still pertains and may become more relevant as Russia once more steps up its nuclear arms production and the US duly responds. It also operates in the tense standoff between India and Pakistan, and if Iran ever does manage to develop a nuclear weapon, the best that can be hoped for is that it will also govern policy between itself and Israel. However, as Schlosser says: “The problem with nuclear deterrence is that it requires secular rational thought on both sides of the equation. We now have ideologies glorifying, celebrating the slaughter of civilians. And willing to die to facilitate the slaughter of civilians and the destruction of cultural monuments. So that makes this technology even more dangerous.” Schlosser notes that Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaida, has quoted with approval a radical imam’s view that using a nuclear weapon against the US that destroyed “tens of millions” of Americans would be sanctified by God and therefore “permissible”. The age of mutually assured destruction seems to have been replaced by one of religiously sanctioned extermination. If, that is, the religious zealots can get their hands on a nuclear weapon. Given the precarious nature of the Pakistani state, which boasts the world’s fastest-growing nuclear arsenal, and its deep penetration by religious zealots, such an eventuality is not utterly inconceivable. And in the nuclear theatre, what is not utterly inconceivable is a serious threat because, as Schlosser repeatedly states, we’re dealing with very low probabilities but extremely large consequences. Sometimes there are black swans and it would be preferable, all things considered, if they were not accompanied by the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Also in the realm of the not utterly inconceivable is the construction of an improvised nuclear device. Here there is a distinction to be drawn with so-called “dirty bombs” which, as Schlosser explains, are fairly easy to build but possess limited lethality. A dirty bomb could be made from a radioisotope gathered from a hospital and then attached to a pipe bomb. “That’s the most likely form of nuclear terrorism and it’s the least dangerous,” says Schlosser, “in the sense that it would contaminate part of the city with radioactivity but it wouldn’t kill many people. It would just lower the real-estate values.” But an improvised nuclear device is a homemade nuclear weapon. It doesn’t require extraordinary ingenuity to build, as long as the terrorists aren’t much concerned about a controlled detonation that enables their escape – ie it would suit a suicide bomber, and there appears to be no shortage of those. What it does require is weapons-grade uranium in sufficient quantity. “The greatest challenge for [would-be nuclear] terrorists has been, how do you get the weapons-grade uranium?” says Schlosser. “Gods of Metal is a description of how they could have done it. Had there been a dozen activists who had been trained with weapons, as opposed to three who believed in peace, love and understanding, they could have readily made a nuclear device on that site and set it off, and that would have had horrific consequences for the state of Tennessee and the eastern seaboard.” For Schlosser, who expresses a great deal of sympathy for the activists in Tennessee, the breach of security they achieved points to a wider malaise than slack guarding. It’s symptomatic of a general complacency about the danger that nuclear weapons represent. In some way we have normalised their existence. We’ve grown accustomed to their being there and not being used. While they remain objects of fear in military terms, they have been slowly stripped of dread in the cultural imagination. In short, we’ve stopped asking “What if?” And yet, as Schlosser reminds us, there have been studies in recent years that suggest that if India and Pakistan were to have a relatively limited nuclear exchange as many as a billion people could be killed. That is a scale of disaster beyond our comprehension. What if indeed. But nonetheless it’s our duty to try to comprehend it rather than push it to the back our minds, to sit behind our concerns about the economy, Syria, Islamic State (Isis), and the future of the euro. Because if we don’t address worst-case scenarios, we will be less able to avoid them. That said, what are we supposed to do once we’ve fully taken on board just how destructive these weapons are? At one point in Gods of Metal Schlosser ventriloquises military experts and academics who believe that getting rid of nuclear weapons is a dangerous fantasy. “A treaty to abolish nuclear weapons,” he writes, “would be as effective as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, an international agreement, signed by the United States in 1928, that outlawed war.” After all, in a world in which a rogue state like North Korea, a dysfunctional state like Pakistan and an increasingly bellicose state like Russia all possess the bomb, what major power is going to lead the way and unilaterally disarm? Schlosser knows such arguments all too well but he doesn’t accept that there’s nothing that can be done. “Without being utopian about the possibility of eliminating this threat next week, you reduce the number of nuclear missiles in the world, you reduce the amount of bomb-grade fissile material in the world, and you do everything you can to guard and protect both that still exists. The proliferation of nuclear weapons, the spread of bomb-making ability, and the lack of proper investment in security is a recipe for disaster.” The UK became the world’s third nuclear power seven years after Hiroshima in October 1952. Ever since the argument has waxed and waned over whether the nation has any real need for nuclear weapons. During the cold war it was said by opponents that our nuclear arsenal served only to make us a Soviet target. Now it is said that it’s a geopolitical anachronism, a relic from an era when Britain was a major imperial power, a hugely expensive means of pretending that we are more important than we are. Jeremy Corbyn, the frontrunner in the Labour leadership contest, has made it clear that he does not want Britain to renew the Trident programme, the permanently patrolling submarine system that is the means of delivery for our stockpile of thermonuclear weapons. CND, of which Corbyn is vice-chairman, claims that Trident will cost £100bn to update. The government’s projections are significantly lower – but then government projections usually are. Before Corbyn’s unlikely leadership challenge, the issue of nuclear weapons had not had much political traction since the Labour party dropped its unpopular unilateral disarmament policy in the early 1990s. What did Schlosser think we should do about renewing Trident? “I’m not going to wade into that loaded issue except to say that the proponents of Trident are the ones who must justify spending that amount of money on this weapon system. And to the degree that your government is planning massive investments in this technology, everybody should know about it, think about it and discuss whether it’s a good idea, and especially discuss what are they for, where are they aimed and how and when will they be used. Because if your government does those things it’s in your name.” It’s a laudable perspective but not one necessarily shared by many in the population at large, who seem to want to know that Trident is there, but not exactly what it’s doing there. That’s the psychological beauty of a submarine – it’s out there, under the water, out of sight and out of mind. There is no specific location like Oak Ridge that reminds us of the potential destruction in our midst. We can both know and not know, which is a dual mindset that has governed much of our thinking about nuclear weapons ever since those twin flashes of reality 70 years ago announced a frightening new age of conceivable cataclysm. To think too much about nuclear armaments is to risk a lifetime of fear and paranoia, whereas to think too little is to fall into a state of denial. Somewhere between those two extremes is a space for rational discussion and debate. The problem is that when it comes to weapons that can kill billions and poison the planet for a generation all rational discussion sounds mad. But the alternative is irrational discussion and that’s unlikely to take us very far. One of the key elements of an effective deterrence programme is to promote the belief that, when it comes down to it, the possessor of nuclear weapons is prepared to use them. But the lesson that Hiroshima, the victim of the most primitive nuclear technology, must teach us is that no one should be prepared to use them. And if no one is prepared to use them, that’s a good basis for the commitment that no one should possess them. Seventy years on, Hiroshima also deserves the promise: never again.

It's a simple concept – put a much needed price on carbon pollution, but return all the revenue that's generated to taxpayers (for example with a monthly refund) to offset rising energy costs. This approach appeals to political conservatives, because it's a free market solution that doesn't increase the size of government. British Columbia (BC) launched a revenue-neutral carbon fee in 2008, with the tax offset through a matching reduction income taxes. So far it's been very successful, decreasing carbon pollution while the BC economy performed just as well as the rest of Canada's. The carbon tax has 64% support among BC voters. The main source of opposition to carbon pricing is the perception that it will 'kill jobs' or otherwise hurt the economy. However, economic forecasts have rarely been done for a carbon fee in which 100% the revenue is returned to the taxpayers. Under proposed revenue-neutral carbon tax legislation, about two-thirds of taxpayers are projected to receive more in refunds than they pay in higher energy prices. It's a net financial gain for most people. This is a key factor that differentiates a revenue-neutral carbon tax system and its economic impacts from other carbon pricing systems. A new study from Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI) models this type of policy. REMI has been developing regional forecasting and policy analysis models since 1980. In their study (full report here, summary here), REMI modeled the regional and national economic impacts of a revenue-neutral carbon tax starting at a modest $10 per metric ton of carbon dioxide in 2016, growing steadily by $10 per year each year. They broke the US into nine distinct geographic regions. A key finding in the study is that personal disposable income would increase under a revenue-neutral carbon tax in every region except for a slight decrease in the fossil fuel-heavy west south central states of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. This is in large part due to the fact that for most people, their monthly refunds would be larger than the increase in their energy costs. REMI report lead author Scott Nystrom explained the reason for this rise in disposable income, “Personal income per capita goes up because households receive the total benefit of the dividend as well as improved job opportunities and wages in the general economy, which more than counteracts any negative effects from higher energy and commodity prices.” The study looked at the impact on the gross domestic and gross regional products (GDP and GRP), and found a positive effect in all regions except for the east south central US (no significant impact), and a negative effect in the west south central states. Overall, the national GDP increases by $80–90 billion annually, with a cumulative increase of over $1.3 trillion. Nystrom explained the GDP increase, “GDP goes up because the fee and dividend provides a boost to consumer spending, reducing demand for fossil fuels does not have a significant impact on American employment and reduces energy imports from abroad, and the border adjustment means American firms are on a level playing field when it comes to competing on the world market.” Likewise, total employment is projected to increase in every region except for a slight decrease in those same fossil fuel heavy southern states. Many of the jobs generated are in sectors like healthcare and retail, where people are anticipated to spend their newfound disposable income. Electricity prices increase for about the first decade due to the carbon pollution price, but then begin to decline as low-carbon energy sources become increasingly cost-effective and widespread. Fossil fuel prices increase steadily as one would expect. Compared to the baseline scenario without a carbon tax, low-carbon energy sources like wind and nuclear power become a much larger part of the power mix. Coal is anticipated to be phased-out entirely by 2025. The purpose of the carbon tax is achieved as well, with carbon dioxide pollution projected to decline 33% after only 10 years, and 52% after 20 years, relative to baseline emissions. In a key side-benefit, because other air pollutant emissions are reduced as fossil fuels are phased out, the report projects that 13,000 premature deaths would be prevented annually after 10 years, with a cumulative 227,000 American lives saved over 20 years. The REMI report illustrates that we could go a long way towards solving the climate threat by implementing a bipartisan revenue-neutral carbon tax. In the process, most regions would experience job growth, economic growth, more disposable income, cleaner air, better public health, and a less risky climate for future generations. Groups like Citizens Climate Lobby are working hard to build up grassroots support for this policy. All we need is for a conservative policymaker to step up and take a leadership role to implement this no-brainer win-win of a global warming solution. Republicans strongly dislike the Obama Administration's EPA greenhouse gas regulations; they could easily replace this big government solution with a small government, free market, economically beneficial revenue-neutral carbon tax. Now is the time for conservatives to join the climate policy debate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2014/jun/15/mr-burns-fathers-and-sons-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-14T23:05:31Z","webTitle":"Mr Burns; Fathers and Sons – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/15/mr-burns-fathers-and-sons-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2014/jun/15/mr-burns-fathers-and-sons-review","fields":{"headline":"Mr Burns; Fathers and Sons – review","bodyText":"When it comes to The Simpsons, I have the enthusiasm of the recent (three years) convert. It maddens me that every evening the unruly family pile on to their sofa just after I have left mine for the stalls. I've spent more than a few minutes in a worthy drama thinking I'd rather be watching Maggie the baby do that expressive thing with her dummy. So I went to Mr Burns with a light tread. Anne Washburn's play, hailed when staged off-Broadway, has a persuasive premise. Come the apocalypse, televisual fragments will store against our ruin. Homer Simpson is now more central to our imaginations than the epic Greek. Washburn's play is named after the dreadful boss at Springfield's ill-maintained nuclear power plant: he whose teeth are a one-man assault on American orthodontics. It opens after an unexplained catastrophe has caused all power stations to fail. The States have no electricity. In the absence of light and hope, survivors gather round a bonfire (are these flames a further allusion to Mr Burns?) trying to recapture a sense of themselves by testing shared memories, recalling lines from the Cape Feare episode of The Simpsons. That light tread turned quickly to a heavy plod. It's a good wheeze to bring together the grand and the popular, the desolate and the cosy. It has some nuggets of information: I had, for example, never counted the Simpsons' fingers. The production is directed by Robert Icke, who made such a dazzling job of that other dystopia, 1984. But it does not get better. The Almeida bravely stages this with two (double the opportunity for scarpering) intervals. At each juncture a really lively new idea is splashily staged, over-extended and hammered into the ground. The second act sees the survivors having formed a company that buys remembered Simpsons lines from the public, remakes episodes and even reconstructs the ads. The ingenious notion would be terrific if at 10 minutes' exposition not 45. The final act is a mishmash musical, a junk opera of the kind that ever since Shockheaded Peter and Jerry Springer has been a vital theatrical force. It is cleverly scored by Orlando Gough and Michael Henry, and designed with exuberant campness by Tom Scutt, zooming around from The Mikado (terrifically warbled by the villain in The Simpsons) to Ricky Martin, Britney Spears and a bit of Japanese Noh drama. Marge's blue pine-cone hairdo is referenced in a headdress of peacock feathers. Lisa is wearing Dorothy red shoes. Mr Burns will make audiences tot up allusions and critics clock up their references. The PhDs will have lots of material: the nature of memory and the need for storytelling. They will recoup a squillion scraps of popular culture. But The Simpsons delivers a reimagining of America (hopeless and loving, thick and talented) in one comic shot. Mr Burns is only a clodhopping commentary. It took Josie Rourke a little time to get into her stride as artistic director at the Donmar – as it did Michael Grandage, though his subsequent triumphs make that easy to forget. Well, she has hit it now, with a string of successes that are the more striking because of their variety. First a Coriolanus, with Tom Hiddleston flayed and flaring. Then James Graham's inclusive Privacy, in which the audience's internet vulnerability was dramatically exposed. Now, a more traditional play, directed by Lyndsey Turner and combining two tremendous writing gifts: Ivan Turgenev and Brian Friel. When Fathers and Sons was published it caused a disturbance. Set on the eve of the emancipation of the serfs in Russia, it pitted the rising ferocious class against the old liberal intelligentsia in the shape of two sons and their parents. In the figure of the nihilist Bazarov, uncouth, truthful, frightening, he created one of the most disturbing of anti-heroes. It's weird to think that the dramatist began his novel, set on large country estates, permeated with a sense of social disruption, on the dinky Isle of Wight. Rob Howell's marvellous design immediately suggests the translation that Friel has made: from Russia to a more generalised Europe. There is no sign of a silver birch, or samovar. Instead, slats of muted multicoloured wood enclose the action, filtering the light but not dappling it. Friel, most usually identified with Chekhov, excels. This is a radical reworking. It takes the central arguments and settings, whisks several scenes together, invents others, to make a neat but leisurely plot. One of the main strands of Turgenev's plot concerns one of the dads, a widower, who takes up with a pretty servant and has a child with her. But Friel gives the servants more of a say. Most crucially, he shifts the balance of the novel. Intellectual debate is there, but the emotional consequences are more wincingly brought home. It's impossible to watch the scenes when elderly parents blink with joy to have their boys home, and make fools of themselves in front of them, without feeling moved. And Anthony Calf is transfixing as Nikolai, drowning in his own words. This production is not, as Turgenev was considered, incendiary. But it does burn. And glow. And glimmer.

The Liberal Democrat leadership seems to be preparing a coalition manifesto by asking the party to abandon distinctive policy positions and seeking its backing for compromises. On several issues including nuclear power, but most notably on the economy, it is saying: \"Why have the real thing when you can have a diluted version of our opponents' policy?\" Liberal Democrat activists know that, to win elections, a voice has to be heard as well as trusted, so are not likely to accept a manifesto endorsing the coalition's entire record as a credible message to take to the public. Any future coalition negotiations should take place once the voice of the electorate has been heard: a party second-guesses that voice at its peril. Political parties have values as a navigation point for the electorate, with policies framed around those values.

If governments are supposed to act as risk managers, protecting their populations from a dangerously volatile and unstable world economy, then successive British governments have failed. The UK is not the only major nation struggling to deal with higher global fuel and food prices and limited home grown resources. Japan, having switched off the last of its 52 nuclear power stations last September as the Fukushima situation deteriorated, has been spending much of the wealth it built up over the last 30 years on imports of liquefied natural gas. The latest figures show gas imports hit $69bn (£41m) last year and were the primary reason the country's trade deficit soared to $112bn in 2013 from $67bn in the previous year. Not surprisingly, the Japanese government said last month it aims to get the reactors restarted. China, Germany and the US have acted in different ways to insure themselves – with differing degrees of success, but they have at least acted. China has sought deals with individual countries to preserve lines of access to food and fuel. Long-term deals with Brazil and a host of cash-strapped African nations have kept the Chinese economic machine turning when harvests have failed and world markets have been convulsed by commodity price shocks. The US, a significant agricultural producer that also controls vast amounts of the world's food through private trading companies such as Cargill and General Mills, has always been more vulnerable to fuel price shocks than the ups and downs of food commodity prices. But in recent years, by unleashing its huge reserves of shale gas, it has been insulated even from this market turmoil. Washington has done all it can without breaching World Trade Organisation rules to prevent its fracking boom from driving down the world price of gas by blocking the conversion of terminals designed to import the stuff into terminals that can export it. Germany, meanwhile, has spent the last 15 years installing enough solar and wind generation to cope with 30% of its fuel needs. That leaves the country still dependent for much of its power on imports of fossil fuels, especially after the decision to run down its nuclear power stations, but provides a partial buffer against volatile prices and geo-political problems – usually in the form of a row with Russia. In Britain most of the debate around risk has ignored food and fuel in favour of finance: reducing high levels of borrowing by households and the government and finding ways to stop banks from courting another disaster. Little attention was paid to energy and food prices until last year, when Labour highlighted how the cost of fuel was wrecking household incomes and Ed Miliband ignited the issue by arguing prices needed to be frozen to give ministers time to construct a new market structure. The obsession with the risks posed by banks was understandable, after Britain was one of the countries worst affected by the banking crash and very obviously one of the most vulnerable to the next disaster without significant reform. Yet analysis by Julian Morgan, chief economist of the Green Alliance thinktank, shows how rising energy prices are part of a longer term commodity price shock that poses an equally profound problem to the UK economy, if not an even deeper one. In terms of risk management, this administration and the next will need to adopt even more unpalatable policies than those required to rein in renegade banks. Not so long ago Britain was happy to ride the energy price rollercoaster: in the 1980s most domestic heating and industrial needs were met by North Sea gas and domestic coal. Later, when coal imports became the norm, the price was helpfully low. As a net exporter of oil, any rise in petrol prices had the positive side-effect of bringing extra foreign exchange and bumper tax receipts. As Morgan charts in his report, The Great Resource Price Shock, for 20 years the west enjoyed an unprecedented glut of commodities and with it ultra-low prices – a period known as the great moderation. Everything from copper to wheat and oil was in plentiful supply. In the late 1990s the price of North Sea Brent crude averaged $16 to $20 a barrel. Today the figure is nearer $108. But unlike in the 1970s, when two overnight increases in oil prices quadrupled the cost in the west and then quadrupled it again, oil prices and the gas prices that are tied umbilically to them, began their steady journey upwards from 2003. Unfortunately, the rise coincided with the moment Britain became a net importer of oil. Though the price dropped to $40 a barrel in the aftermath of the banking crash, it has recovered strongly and ranks as a huge cost to the UK economy, with comparatively little offsetting income from the declining gas and oil businesses of Aberdeen. Then there is the rising cost of food and the UK's increasing reliance on imports to feed the nation. Morgan's report shows that between 2000 and 2012 Britain's net dependency on imports of food rose from 33% to 38%. He documents how between 2003 and 2013 world fuel prices rose four times and metal prices trebled. Food prices roughly doubled. In that time the Bank of England, which has the job of controlling inflation, was forced to write 14 letters to the Treasury explaining why inflation was at least one percentage point higher than its 2% target. Morgan, who has gone back over those letters, found that on only one occasion did Bank governor Mervyn King blame an overheating economy and that was in 2007, months ahead of the Northern Rock debacle. In many he blamed the rise in VAT to 20%. In all the others, King said either the depreciation of the pound or rising import prices underpinned rising domestic prices. In recent months, sterling has begun to rise, but this is unlikely to bring the situation back into equilibrium. North Sea oil and gas is in long-term decline, so as the economy recovers and the demand for fuel increases, Britain must import more, offsetting sterling's greater purchasing power. The effect can be seen in the last trade deficit figures. During the third quarter of 2013, our trade deficit equalled 5.1% of GDP, the biggest in more than 20 years. Morgan shows how rising fuel and food prices have eaten into real incomes more than even Labour has laid out in its assault on government policy. We know average real earnings fell in the decade up to 2013 – coming down from £327 to £319 a week once inflation is factored in. But if the effects of rising fuel and food prices are removed, by excluding energy and unprocessed food, real average earnings would have risen over the decade, to £335 a week. In other words, Morgan says, real earnings could have been around 5% higher in 2013. An average £2,954 annual bill for food and £1,206 spent on domestic fuel in 2012 would have been £2,532 for food and £619 for fuel if fuel and food prices had risen only in line with the overall consumer prices index, rather than galloping ahead. It implies a combined household saving of more than £1,000 a year on essential bills. Green Alliance advocates Britain take a more activist stance on energy and food conservation, alongside greater spending on renewable energy production, to protect against further price shocks and the volatility that always seems to send prices up rather than down. It is a policy that former environment minister Chris Huhne adopted before he was forced to resign and one that has dissipated under George Osborne's austerity programme. There are two political problems with this: first, restricting food waste and fuel conservation are unglamorous; secondly, they involve government intervention at a moment in history when most governments are likened to estate agents – trusted to do little more than look out for themselves. And for those looking to shale gas to alleviate at least half of the problem – as Osborne admitted last month to a House of Lords committee – it will be produced by foreign companies and mostly exported, leaving only employment and taxes as the main benefits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2013/nov/15/japan-scaling-back-cut-greenhouse-gases","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-15T12:05:45Z","webTitle":"Japan under fire for scaling back plans to cut greenhouse gases","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/nov/15/japan-scaling-back-cut-greenhouse-gases","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/nov/15/japan-scaling-back-cut-greenhouse-gases","fields":{"headline":"Japan under fire for scaling back plans to cut greenhouse gases","bodyText":"The UN climate talks in Warsaw, Poland, were faced with a new crisis on Friday, after Japan, the world's fifth largest greenhouse gas emitter, slashed its plans to reduce emissions from 25% to just 3.8% on 2005 figures. The move was immediately criticised as \"irresponsible\" and \"unambitious\" by developing countries and climate groups at the talks. In a statement, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), a group of 44 low-lying island and coastal nations that are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, said: \"[We] are extremely concerned that the announcement represents a huge step backwards in the global effort to hold warming below the essential 1.5-2 degrees celsius threshold, and puts our populations at great risk. \"This is neither the time nor the place to be backtracking on commitments. Developed countries have committed to taking the lead and must do so as we work to peak global emissions this decade and ink a new global agreement in 2015. \"We are also aware that the crisis now unfolding in the Philippines in the wake of typhoon Haiyan, which has also caused significant damage for our members in Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia, is just the latest in a series of climate-related extreme weather catastrophes.\" Britain's energy and climate change secretary, Ed Davey, called the decision \"deeply disappointing\" and at odds with the need to tackle global warming. He was still hopeful that the UK and other members of the G8 leading economies could encourage Tokyo to change its mind. \"It is deeply disappointing that the Japanese government has taken this decision to significantly revise down its 2020 emissions target. This announcement runs counter to the broader political commitment to tackle climate change, recently reaffirmed by G8, as well as the enhanced ambition we have seen from the world's major emitters,\" he argued in unusually robust terms. \"Yet I believe we can persuade Japan to change her mind again, to resume her leadership role in the world on climate change. Despite the challenges, if the public backs the government it can invest in low carbon electricity,\" he added. However, Christiana Figueres, UNFCCC exective secretary, said she \"understood\" the problems that Japan faced following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which had forced the country to close 50 nuclear power plants. \"I do have some understanding that Japan has been hit by several catstrophes in the past few years. My hope is that Japan understands that investment in renewable energies galvanises investments and creates new jobs,\" Figueres said. \"This move by Japan could have a devastating impact on the tone of discussion here in Warsaw,\" said Naoyuki Yamagishi, WWF Japan's climate ands enrgy group leader at the talks. \"This decision is a gross negligence of its responsibility and should be revised in line with the level that science and justice requires.\" As compensation, Japan said that its public and private sectors intended to raise $16bn (£9.9bn) by 2015 to help developing countries reduce their emissions, with the intention of helping others to reduce the emissions that it could not. The aid package is thought to include supplying developing countries with \"green\" technologies developed by Japanese firms, including offshore wind turbines, fuel-cell vehicles and high-tech housing insulation. No figures were given on the scale of the emission cuts that the package might achieve. \"The new target is based on zero nuclear power in the future. We have to lower our ambition level,\" said Hiroshi Minami, Japan's chief negotiator. The talks in Poland, at which 190 countries are meeting to try to agree additional action to put the world on course to avoid dangerous climate change, have been overshadowed by typhoon Haiyan, which has increased the determination of developing countries to negotiate compensation for climate damage done in the past. The Japanese announcement follows open criticism by Australia and Canada of policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in their countries, and reluctance from the US and Europe to aim for more ambitious emissions cuts. Oxfam's climate change spokesperson, Kelly Dent, said: \"Japan's dramatic U-turn on its emissions target commitments is a slap in the face for poor countries who are right now struggling to cope with changes to their climate, and who will face yet more extreme and unpredictable weather in the future.\" She added: \"As one of the world's largest Co2 emitters, Japan has a responsibility to help lead the world in reducing emissions to ensure temperatures are kept at a safe level below 1.5 degrees celsius. Instead, their actions may well further erode trust in current negotiations which must deliver a global climate deal in 2015.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/apr/15/uranium-workers-dying-cancer-rio-tinto-namibia-mine","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-15T10:52:59Z","webTitle":"Uranium workers dying after time at Namibia mine, report warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/15/uranium-workers-dying-cancer-rio-tinto-namibia-mine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/apr/15/uranium-workers-dying-cancer-rio-tinto-namibia-mine","fields":{"headline":"Uranium workers dying after time at Namibia mine, report warns","bodyText":"Miners who dug uranium ore that supplied the British and US military in the 1970s with the raw material for bombs and civil nuclear power are reported to be dying of cancers and unexplained illnesses after working in one of Africa's largest mines. A study based on questionnaires of current and former workers at the giant Rio Tinto-owned Rössing uranium mine in Namibia says that everyone questioned was aware of people who are now suffering lung infections and unknown illnesses thought to be linked to their work. The mine, in the Namib desert, produces around 7% of the world's uranium but was operated with rudimentary safety when it opened in 1976. \"People get sick. We are seeing it in people that have worked for Rössing for a long time. They just go back and die after working at Rössing,\" one man told researchers working with Earthlife Namibia and the Labour Resource and Research Institute. The study, which is expected to be published this week, accepts that working conditions in the mine have greatly improved but says that all workers questioned said that they were exposed to high levels of dust. \"Two current workers are on sick leave since 2000 and 2003. One worked as a laboratory technician for 24 years and claims to have proof he was radiated,\" says a summary of the paper seen by the Guardian. Rössing, which mines millions of tonnes of rock a year to extract uranium, employs more than 1,500 people. \"Most workers stated that they are not informed about their health conditions and do not know if they have been exposed to radiation or not. Some workers said they consulted a private doctor to get a second opinion,\" say the authors. \"The older workers all said they know miners dying of cancers and other illnesses. Many of these are now retired and many have already died of cancers,\" says the report. A spokesman for Rio Tinto said that Rössing has been recognised by independent consultants as one of the world's safest mines. \"The health and safety of our employees is the top priority. We have health management systems in place to make sure that everyone goes home safe and healthy every day. Effective controls ensure that radiation exposures to employees are kept well below the Rössing standard for occupational radiation exposure. \"The company keeps detailed records of the health status of its workforce from the day of employment to the day they leave the company. It therefore does not need to speculate on health issues of its employees.\" One former worker said: \"Yes, I have cancer now. In the beginning they [Rio Tinto] did not want to give money for the treatment but later when they referred me to a doctor for an operation they gave me money for treatment.\" \"Doctors were told not to inform us with our results or tell our illness. They only supply you with medications when you are totally finished up or about to die,\" said another. During the first years of operation, Rössing operated with a migrant labour system which the International Commission of Jurists declared illegal and said was similar to slavery. Black workers lived on the mine premises and were exposed to dust and radiation 24 hours a day and the mine became the focus for protests by anti-apartheid and anti-nuclear groups. Shares in the mine are owned 69% by UK-based Rio Tinto, and 15% by the government of Iran. The Namibian government has denied supplying Iran with Namibian uranium which could be used for nuclear weapons. \"Uranium companies generally deny that workers get sick because of exposure to radiation. They blame the bad health conditions to unhealthy lifestyles such as eating habits, tobacco smoking and alcohol,\" says the study. Former Rössing mineworkers and people from communities adversely affected by Rio Tinto mines in west Papua, Madagascar, Namibia, Mongolia and the US will petition Rio Tinto shareholders at Tuesday's annual meeting in London. \"Rio Tinto is enormous. Its history of attacks on workers' rights, and environmental destruction has had a particularly damaging impact across the world,\" said Richard Solly, co-ordinator of London Mining Network, an alliance of human rights, development, environmental and solidarity groups."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/earth-insight/2013/jun/25/obama-speech-climate-action-plan-disaster1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-25T20:42:00Z","webTitle":"Obama's fracked-up climate strategy will guarantee global warming disaster | Nafeez Ahmed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/jun/25/obama-speech-climate-action-plan-disaster1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/jun/25/obama-speech-climate-action-plan-disaster1","fields":{"headline":"Obama's fracked-up climate strategy will guarantee global warming disaster","bodyText":"President Obama's much-anticipated speech at Georgetown University unveiling America's new climate change strategy offers welcome re-affirmation of the US government's recognition of global warming dangers. Plans to regulate coal plants, beef up defences against flooding and sea level rise, increase energy efficiency for homes and businesses, and fast track permits for renewable energy on public lands, are critical steps forward. But the new climate strategy remains fatally compromised by Obama's unflinching commitment to the maximum possible exploitation of fossil fuels - a contradiction that has set the world on course to trigger unmitigated catastrophe in coming decades. Central to the plan is Obama's reiteration of his commitment to cutting US greenhouse gas emissions 17% from 2005 levels by 2020. But this target is too little, too late - amounting to only a 4% cut in emissions compared with 1990 levels. Even before this target was enshrined into US law, scientists warned that the pledge \"will not be enough to head off dangerous climate change\" as global temperatures would still breach the 2C target accepted by governments as the safe limit for global warming. Indeed, one study found that: \"The pledges on the table will not halt emissions growth before 2040... Instead, global emissions are likely to be nearly double 1990 levels by 2040 based on present pledges.\" A new study by Climate Action Tracker (CAT) out this month concludes that full implementation of the pledges would still lead to a 3.3C rise by 2100. Based on actual climate policies so far, however, CAT warned that governments are \"less likely than ever to deliver on the Copenhagen pledges.\" If this continues, temperatures could exceed 4C by the end of the century, triggering positive feedbacks leading to further warming. In the mix of Obama's plan are nuclear power and 'clean coal' technologies, all of which have huge questions marks over their ability to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. And though Obama promised to only ratify the Keystone XL pipeline if its \"net effect\" does not \"significantly exacerbate\" carbon pollution (which it already does), exploiting America's domestic shale oil and gas reserves through fracking remains an integral part of the new plan. The defunct \"net effect\" argument has already been used to legitimise shale gas, officially touted as a clean bridge fuel. But shale gas is far from clean. In 2011, the first comprehensive analysis of emissions from shale gas in the journal Climatic Change found that: \"The footprint for shale gas is greater than that for conventional gas or oil when viewed on any time horizon, but particularly so over 20 years. Compared to coal, the footprint of shale gas is at least 20% greater and perhaps more than twice as great on the 20-year horizon and is comparable when compared over 100 years.\" In an updated analysis published last year, the study authors reiterated these findings: \"... for most uses, the GHG footprint of shale gas is greater than that of other fossil fuels on time scales of up to 100 years. When used to generate electricity, the shale-gas footprint is still significantly greater than that of coal at decadal time scales but is less at the century scale... We reiterate our conclusion... that shale gas is not a suitable bridge fuel for the 21st Century.\" What about nuclear power? A 2008 study in the International Journal of Nuclear Governance, Economy and Ecology pointed out that the construction, mining, milling, transporting, refining, enrichment, waste reprocessing/disposal, fabrication, operation and decommissioning processes of nuclear power all release fossil fuel emissions. Also, nuclear power is not efficient enough to replace oil, gas and coal. To do so nuclear production would need to increase by 10.5 per cent every year from 2010 to 2050 - an \"unsustainable prospect\" requiring a \"cannibalistic effect\", whereby nuclear energy itself must be used to supply the energy for future nuclear power plants. Study author Dr. Joshua Pearce further argued last year that unless nuclear power adopts \"improved technology and efficiency through the entire life cycle to prevent energy cannibalism during rapid growth\", the industry could \"face obsolescence\" compared to renewables. And a new report by the Berlin-based Energy Watch Group warns of a \"high risk of a uranium supply gap for nuclear reactors before 2020.\" What about carbon capture and storage (CCS), where we burn fossil fuels, but capture the carbon dioxide and 'sequester' it back underground? Some suggest we could capture half the world's emitted carbon in this way by the 2040s. Unfortunately, it sounds too good to be true - and it is. As environmental scientist Vaclav Smil calculates, to sequester just a fifth of current CO2 emissions: \"... we would have to create an entirely new worldwide absorption-gathering-compression-transportation- storage industry whose annual throughput would have to be about 70 percent larger than the annual volume now handled by the global crude oil industry whose immense infrastructure of wells, pipelines, compressor stations and storages took generations to build.\" The financial and energy costs of CCS are therefore meteorically unsustainable. The problem here is simple. Obama's new climate plan, however well intentioned (or not), is tied to fatally flawed energy politics. The world needs a climate strategy based on science - not wishful thinking inspired by the fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies.

Hafnium gets its name from the Latin for Copenhagen, where it was discovered. Hafnium is a shiny, silver-coloured metal that is never found free in the wild. Hafnium is closely associated with zirconium with which it shares many similarities. In fact, hafnium is so chemically similar to zirconium that these twin elements are extremely difficult to distinguish and separate. For this reason, hafnium often contains zirconium impurities. In addition to having similar chemical reactions and forming the same chemical compounds, hafnium and zirconium are also interesting because the diameters of their atoms are the same size due to the internal configuration of hafnium's additional electrons. Thus, hafnium is much denser than its twin element, so after pure samples of hafnium were finally prepared, the atomic mass of both hafnium and zirconium had to be revised. For these reasons, hafnium was the penultimate radiostable element to be discovered. In addition to its close association with its twin element, hafnium is scientifically interesting because Dmitri Mendeleev predicted its existence based on his periodic table 54 years before it was actually discovered. Hafnium is used by the computer industry to create smaller and smaller microchips that operate more effectively whilst using less energy by regulating the flow of electricity through transistors. Hafnium is also useful to the nuclear power industry as a \"neutron sponge\" in reactor control rods. This is one characteristic that distinguishes hafnium from zirconium: hafnium is 600 times more effective at absorbing neutrons than its elemental twin. Hafnium is not very interesting to biologists because it is not necessary for life. Although assumed to be biologically harmful, its toxicity is poorly characterised because pure samples are so difficult (and so expensive) to obtain. However, that said, no one has ever died of hafnium poisoning. Here are our favourite chemists telling us a little more about hafnium: [video link] .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

Even as one group was carting people off from the steps of St Paul's in London on Monday night to remove Occupy protesters, so another was storming a Somerset farmhouse early on Wednesday to snuff out a small protest against the proposed two new Hinkley C nuclear power stations. End of story? Not at all. Occupy will be back and anger in Someset is growing at the way that the nuclear steamroller is gearing up to build its stations. EDF, who went to the high court in London rather than Bristol, tried to get a blanket injunction on anyone going near the site but was thwarted by the court which could see no justification in granting anything so wideranging. The Somerset protests are against nuclear power itself but also at the way the company appears to be flouting democracy and the new planning laws even before it starts building. EDF has permission to spend £100m preparing the site for the two power stations on the basis that they will return many millions tonnes of earth and restore the land to exactly how it was, should a public inspector decline to give them planning permsssion in 2013. This is clearly impossible, so the EDF must be 100% certain that it will get permission to build. In which case, say the protesters, the whole consultation exercise and planning process is a sham - a situation that looks likely to be subject to further court cases. Half of all local residents are against the power station but everyone in the area is united in believing that the planning system has been corrupted by cash handouts and pressure from central government. It suggests that from now on that any company will be allowed to start work on any giant project and be allowed to trash any piece of land without any demcoratic accountability in the name of national interest, climate change or anything else that the government decrees. Yet again, nuclear power is cast as a corporate bully working as an accomplice of government. What makes it worse, is that I am informed that some pro-nuclear greens have written to the protesters in Somerset urging them not to protest against EDF. If this is the case, then those pro-nuclear greens should be invited to write to the 3,000 \"misguided\" Indian protesters of the People's Movement against Nuclear Energy who have been on hunger strike in Tamil Nadu in protest against two nuclear power stations being built there, as well as the many thousands of Chinese who are protesting nuclear plants in Anhui province. Both these nascent anti-nuclear protests are in the forefront of much wider democracy movements, demanding corporate and government accountability. The point is that right across the world it is not just the nuclear technology which is so offensive to people, but the arrogance, callousness and ruthless steamrollering of any opposition that invariably accompanies nuclear projects. What the pro-nuclear folk here do not seem to understand is that the abuse of political power is as dangerous as the power source itself. • This article was amended to change 'flaunting' to 'flouting'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jun/10/waiting-climate-deal-set-world-path-5c","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-10T10:58:52Z","webTitle":"Waiting on new climate deal 'will set world on a path to 5C warming'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/10/waiting-climate-deal-set-world-path-5c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jun/10/waiting-climate-deal-set-world-path-5c","fields":{"headline":"Waiting on new climate deal 'will set world on a path to 5C warming'","bodyText":"The world cannot afford to wait for a new global climate change agreement to come into force in 2020, because doing so will mean an end to hopes of limiting global warming to moderate levels, one of the world's foremost authorities on energy has warned. Carbon dioxide emissions from energy rose by 1.4% in 2012 to a record high of more than 31bn tonnes, according to a report from the International Energy Agency on Monday, driven in part by a striking 6% rise in emissions from Japan following its phase-out of nuclear power and continuing growth in emissions from China. Fatih Birol, chief economist at the IEA, and one of the world's most respected energy experts, told the Guardian that greenhouse gas emissions were continuing to rise so fast that pinning hopes on a replacement for the Kyoto protocol would set the world on a path to 5C of warming, which would be catastrophic. Birol urged governments to take urgent action on improving energy efficiency, replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon power, stopping the construction of inefficient power plants and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, as low or no-cost ways of reducing emissions quickly. \"This will not harm economic growth, and they are policies that can be taken in a fragile economic context,\" he said. The IEA has calculated that making clean energy investments sooner would be cheaper than leaving them until after 2020. About $1.5 trillion should be spent before 2020 to meet climate targets, it found, but if the investments are left until after 2020 it will take $5tn to achieve the same results. Governments are negotiating under the United Nations to forge a global deal on emissions that would be signed in 2015 but not come into force until 2020. Until then, most countries have their own voluntary goals to curb carbon, but these fall well short of the cuts scientists say are needed to limit temperature rises to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, which is regarded as the limit of safety beyond which warming is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. Birol said: \"I am very worried about the emissions trends. The chance of keeping to 2C is still there, technically, but it is not very great. It is becoming extremely challenging.\" Officials are meeting in Bonn this week in the next round of the ongoing UN talks, and Birol urged \"a change in political mood\" in the run-up to the 2015 deadline. He noted that there were a few positive trends among the rising carbon levels identified by the IEA, the gold standard on energy and emissions data. Emissions from energy in the US are now at levels not seen since the mid 1990s, having dropped by 3.8% in 2012 due to the effects of the shale gas boom that has led to gas replacing coal. But Birol warned that this could not be replicated globally: \"Shale gas is not a panacea. It can only be helpful if we see these other low-carbon technologies also [coming into widespread use] if we are serious about 2C.\" Birol also saw positive trends in China, the world's biggest emitter. Although China's emissions rose by more than 300m tonnes, this was one of the smallest annual increases in two decades, Birol said. \"The Chinese government has made huge efforts in energy efficiency, and a major effort on renewable energy such as hydroelectricity and wind.\" Lord Stern of Brentford, author of the landmark Stern review of the economics of climate change, said the IEA report showed the importance of making investments quickly in cleaner energy. He said: \"Government-induced policy risk from lack of clarity on energy and climate policy is, in many parts of the world, a major deterrent to long-term investment. This is surely unacceptable at a time of idle resources, low interest rates, strong liquidity within much of the private sector, attractive medium-term prospects for low-carbon growth and a climate at great risk.\" He added: \"The IEA has also warned of the dangers of locking in fossil fuel infrastructure, which would need to be retired early, at great additional cost, in order to meet the 2C target. The IEA's message is crystal clear: dither and delay in making the transition to a low-carbon energy system will be risky and expensive.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/oct/22/ineos-gas-plant-taxpayer-scheme-guarantee","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-22T18:28:01Z","webTitle":"Ineos gas plant plan set for taxpayer guarantee scheme backing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/22/ineos-gas-plant-taxpayer-scheme-guarantee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/oct/22/ineos-gas-plant-taxpayer-scheme-guarantee","fields":{"headline":"Ineos gas plant plan set for taxpayer guarantee scheme backing","bodyText":"Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has announced that Ineos could be among the recipients of up to £40bn-worth of taxpayer-backed guarantees for major infrastructure projects.

Thanks for your company today, it’s been marvellous, as always. Let’s take stock. Monday, in politics: With Labor chalking up election victory in Victoria over the weekend, MPs returned to Canberra for the final sitting week of 2014. The prime minister attempted to draw a line over a miserable couple of weeks by holding an ‘all comers, all questions’ press conference in which he acknowledged that he’d said one thing before the election on cuts to the ABC, and another thing afterwards. He also noted that when it came to the government’s travails, the buck stopped with him. Abbott also gave a quarter inch on the controversial defence pay deal, giving back some allowances, but insisting that gesture had to be paid for out of the defence budget, because gritted teeth concessions to Jacqui Lambie don’t grow on trees. Apart from these gentle nods to humility and human kindness, Abbott dug in on his GP co-payments, at least until after MYEFO; and declared he wanted a deal done on the higher education reforms this week. The education minister Christopher Pyne obliged by outlining some concessions to crossbenchers, but it’s not yet clear whether the government will have to go further. Clive Palmer is being suitably cagey. Speaking of Palmer, the mining magnate and PUP leader went to the National Press Club at lunchtime apparently thinking it was open mic night, and then flicked the switch to bellicose when journalists had the temerity to ask questions on subjects Palmer finds not fit for airing in polite company – like his court proceedings in Queensland. Unable to flee the venue, Palmer just got personal, and that was seriously unpleasant television. The prime minister used Question Time to say he was delivering and the government was doing very well, if only people would stop and notice. The LDP senator David Leyonjhelm said various things which we’ve covered enough already. ABC boss Mark Scott appeared before Senate Estimates. That’s today. Tomorrow will be tomorrow, and I’ll see you then. A few moments ago in the Senate the Liberal senator Bill Heffernan was unleashing his inner cranky on tax avoidance by multinationals. Heffernan is a one man crusade against profit shifting. Today he described major companies as being like the churches and the altar boys, denying there’s a problem. Here’s brick Heff, with his pipe bomb. Some quality commentary to share. Political blogger Paula Matthewson, on The Drum. Today’s column is an interesting reflection on Tony Abbott’s chief of staff, Peta Credlin – who is carrying the can for the government’s woes. Paula’s thesis is the job is just too big for one person to handle. During much of the Howard years, different aspects of the role currently being performed by Credlin were divided among a trusted few. During the time he was Howard’s CoS, Arthur Sinodinos was the political strategist and confidante who worked with the Cabinet Office on policy development, while Tony Nutt was the political enforcer. Sinodinos brought to the PMO a fundamental understanding of how government works - being a former Treasury official - while Nutt, the impeccably credentialed political fix-it man, did what he does best. Their good cop/bad cop routine maintained discipline while ensuring that everyone felt valued and consulted. Howard’s best years were arguably when this arrangement was in place. And my colleague Lenore Taylor, on today’s Operation Reset the Press Gallery Tantrum. The prime minister’s 45-minute media conference on Monday was a determined attempt to manoeuvre himself out of a dire political situation and reset the debate. With even the conservative commentariat attacking his government, it was calculated to give the impression he was listening (sure, things have been a bit ragged) and making concessions (yes, ABC cuts are at odds with what I said before the election), while pointing out hand on heart that he had “guts” and “conviction” (one thing no one had ever really doubted). But besides a minor concession on Australian Defence Force allowances and accepting the bleeding obvious about his broken promise on the ABC, there were no actual changes to give effect to the “reset”. That may be because every way the prime minister turns there’s an obstacle he put there himself. Senator Leyonhjelm has veered away from the contents of politician’s trousers to issuing strange non-specific no-threats. He’s released a statement declaring the government must create movement towards marriage equality within six months, or the puppy will get it. Well, sort of. The puppy might not get a puppy treat. Leyonhjelm: The crossbench is ignored until the government realises it hasn’t got the numbers, then we get lobbied to the moon and back. However, it seems the only way to get concessions is to threaten to vote against every government bill, which Senator Lambie is currently doing and which I once threatened to do over the issue of torture in national security legislation. If there is no substantive movement on a conscience vote on this bill in six months, then I will consider declining to give the government the benefit of the doubt. Time for a little bit of #BrickSenate. The red room is working through various motions this afternoon before circling back this evening to the higher education debate. In a motion just before concerning the activities of the super trawler, it was interesting to see Green senator and the party’s higher education spokeswoman Lee Rhiannon have a word to Ricky Muir. There have been questions around today about whether Muir’s stated concerns about the higher education package will translate into actual opposition once the issue comes to a vote. Oh Ricky you’re so fine, you’re so fine you blow my mind. Hey Ricky. Hey Ricky. Housekeeping, the sequel. In a post at 8.23am this morning I gave the foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop a tap for presenting the GP co-payment as a saving. It is a saving according to the budget papers, but the saving is then shifted off to the Coalition’s proposed medical research fund – so in the commonly understood meaning of saving, the co-payment is a pretty odd saving. I’ve made further inquiries with the treasurer’s office because I understand budget accounting magic is a highly specialised field. The explanation from Hockey’s office is the co-payment is a saving both in word and in deed, because the medical research fund will make contributions to medical research from interest, rather than from the wad of money sitting in the fund. So the saving remains a saving because the saving is banked in the fund. On that basis, I think I was harsh on Bishop in this instance. I get the broad rationale, so like the prime minister earlier today on the ABC, I’m sorry for my overstatement. However I stand by my verdict in the same post from early this morning that the Labor leader Bill Shorten was, and remains, dork of the morning. No contest. Housekeeping. The house is currently considering one of the terror bills. The main focus of the senate, as we’ve flagged, is higher education. Here’s Daniel Hurst’s news wrap on the debate thus far. I promised you Amanda Meade’s news story on Mark Scott’s evidence to estimates this morning. Amanda reports that the ABC audience will be better served in local news when the eight local 7.30 programs are no longer on air, the ABC’s director of news, Kate Torney. (Say wut?) Some chamber shots now. The immigration minister, Scott Morrison, dance fighting. The prime minister, having a think. The prime minister has called time on Question Time. Catherine King is seeking the microphone to object to the contention she misused taxpayers money in the regional grants scheme. King says if she was rorting or misappropriating funds, she was pretty bad at it, because a number of projects were funded in Coalition-held electorates – two thirds, in fact. * The post has been amended from the original to reflect King’s statement to parliament that two thirds of the grants went to Coalition electorates. I didn’t catch the specific ratio in real time, apologies. Health minister, Peter Dutton, who is resorting to full tilt electioneering rather soon. (You think we are rubbish – well, how about these clowns?) They (Labor) are cocky at the moment. They believe they are going to be returned at the next election and I think it is important for people to understand that they did make mistakes, considerable ones when they were last in government – and they have learnt nothing since. They are all full of confidence at the moment but we have seen demonstrated today by the minister – the assistant minister for infrastructure and by the treasurer as well, that they were a bad government. The Rudd/Gillard years were bad for this country. They were a bad government. (So noted.) Labor’s health spokeswoman Catherine King is at the dispatch box. Treasurer Joe Hockey thinks attack is the best form of defence. I think the Australian people deserve an apology from you. The Australian people deserve an apology from you for the contempt you have shown for taxpayers’ money. I am sorry, there is an audit report that says that the member for Ballarat, the member for Ballarat rorted Australian taxpayers. (This relates to an audit report out late last week about regional grants). Boilover on the Labor side. Anthony Albanese. I would ask you to ask the honourable member to withdraw. You cannot make an accusation such as that against another member of parliament without a substantive motion. I would ask him for the dignity of the house to simply withdraw and then he can go on to answer the question. That cannot be left to stand. Madam Speaker, to whom the Albanese entreaty is addressed, is confused. What should be withdrawn, exactly? Albanese: The term wilful. You are aware of what it is and he knows full well. He has shown from time to time a sense of decency and I would ask him to do it here now. (I’m not sure Hockey used the word wilful. If he did, I confess I missed it.) The shadow attorney-general Mark Dreyfus has inquired under what circumstances Arthur Sinodinos will return to his ministry. Sinodinos has been troubled by the folks at Icac in NSW. The prime minister says the circumstances would be very happy circumstances. But he gives no commitment that Sinodinos will return to the ministry. Well hello there. Bill Shorten, keeping it J. To the prime minister. Q: Given the defence pay debacle, will Senator Johnston still be the defence minister next February or does the buck stop with you? (I suspect that would mean the buck stopped with Johnston, but anyhow ..) For the record Abbott didn’t answer the question about whether Johnston would still have his job after Christmas. But in a spirit of generosity, Abbott allows Shorten to table a petition he forgot to table during his question. Treasurer Joe Hockey, keeping it P. Preferring populist posturing .. that is the Labor Party way. We know that. That is the Labor Party way. Breaking chamber feels. The education minister Christopher Pyne would like the Senate to pass the higher education package. The prime minister meanwhile would like to blame Labor for the defence pay deal. Abbott: I think members of our defence force think that the leader of the opposition has a bit of a hide asking questions like this. Speaking of the great big road. Labor’s Anthony Albanese to the prime minister. Q: I refer to the prime minister’s threats to Victorians to withdraw $3bn of Commonwealth funding for infrastructure if they didn’t vote Liberal on Saturday. Can the prime minister assure the people of Victoria that they will always get their fair share of Commonwealth infrastructure funding? Tony Abbott: I certainly can assure the people of Victoria that they will get their fair share of projects. I can assure them of that. I do hope that the incoming Premier of Victoria does reconsider his misguided commitment to tear up the East West Link contract. I do hope he will reconsider that commitment because it is pretty clear that the people of Victoria do want the East West Link. (I’m not sure it’s that clear given they voted for the other mob – but perhaps there’s a wrinkle here I’m missing.) Abbott: We are only too happy to continue to deliver $3bn to government of Victoria, provided it goes ahead with building the East West Link that it is contracted and obligated to build. Manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, to Abbott: Q: Is the prime minister seriously asking the Victorian government to break an election commitment the Monday after the election? Abbott: (This) is what we are saying to the incoming Victorian government, honour the contracts that were dually entered into by the legitimate Government of Victoria. Do what your federal colleagues advise you to do. Do what the leader of the opposition thinks is the right thing to do, collect the $3bn that the federal government is offering you and get on with building East West Link. Meanwhile in the other place, the defence minister David Johnston has just informed the chamber that the East West link is actually a boon for public transport. He’s noted that buses and taxis run on roads. Labor’s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, sticking in the knife after the Nationals shocking showing in the Victorian election. Q: My question is to the minister for agriculture. I refer to the minister’s comments that the responsibility for the future of SPC’s fruit cannery lay fair and square with the Liberal Party. Given the Victorian Nationals have lost the seat of Shepparton after 47 years, and will lose their party status, does the minister accept personal responsibility for the loss of this seat? Barnaby Joyce has flushed bright beetroot. Joyce says everything is Labor’s fault. The Labor party creates the pigsty and we have to clean it up. (I thought we were on tinned pears.) The prime minister is delivering. Whatever question he gets asked. Delivering. Incoming from Shorten. Q: My question is to the prime minister. The former Victorian Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett has said “There is more than barnacles they will have to clean up before Christmas. Their domestic policies are a shambles.” Does the buck stop with the PM when it comes to his domestic policy shambles? Abbott: The carbon tax, that has gone. The mining tax, that has gone. Free trade agreements, they are delivered. Red tape reductions, about $2bn in annual red tape reductions. $1 trillion worth of environmental approvals granted. $550 worth of benefits to every Australian household. This is a government which is delivering for the people of Australia and above all else, we are not shirking the task of budget repair. A Dorothy Dixer for the prime minister. Q: My question is to the prime minister. Will the prime minister outline to the house actions the government has taken in 2014 to strengthen the economy and deliver real benefits for families and small businesses in my electorate? Tony Abbott: I do thank the member for Barton for his question. This has been a year of delivery of the Australian people. (Theatrical laughter from folks opposite.) It has. Here is the hour of glower. I’ve been slow off the mark due to a moment of split screening between the chambers. Sorry about that. In the House, there are some nice tributes to cricketer Phillip Hughes who died tragically last week. In the Senate, Labor is asking questions which seem to suggest the opposition is aware of documents indicating the government has made a decision to purchase Japanese submarines. This is the decision the government says it has not yet made. In which? At which? I didn’t get a chance earlier to post Mike’s terrific shots from bikie fest down the front earlier, in which David Leyonhjelm unexpectedly invoked a penis. Question time beckons. #FacePalmer This is a truly disgraceful outing from Palmer. He’s invoking contempt of court as a reason for not answering questions – which is not in and of itself unreasonable. But there’s no excuse for bully boy swagger at the NPC podium. It’s not open mic night at the rent seekers convention, this is a forum for accountability. Now Steven Scott, from The Courier Mail. Q: I’d like to take you back to that court case as well, if I could. Palmer: I can’t take any questions on that, because it’s before the courts. Scott: I’m going to ask it anyway. Palmer: Why don’t you just ask a question about the topic? Have some guts to Rupert, don’t do what he tells you from New York. Stand up and be a journalist. Don’t read off that, think of your own brain and think of a question. Scott: You filibustered for some time now. Palmer: I’m not filibustering. (The National Press Club is not an open microphone. Palmer doesn’t seem to understand that.) Two questions about the court proceedings Palmer is currently involved in. The PUP leader, astonishingly, manages not to storm away from the podium. But he also manages to avoid the substance of the questions. Palmer provides his usual patter: The Australian is biased against him, as is the West Australian because Kerry Stokes wants to use some of my land at Cape Preston to put his port under and he’s concerned about that. To Andrew Tillett from The West Australian: You’re probably being lobbied by the millions of dollars of lobbyists that the Chinese government is spending trying to take control of ports and resources in this country and I’m standing up against that. My companies are, I’m retired, I’m a politician now. Palmer is asked about the higher education bill. He creates a bit of wriggle room. He says PUP opposes the current bill. Palmer says he believes Ricky Muir also opposes the current bill. Palmer says Glenn Lazarus – who was expected with Palmer at the club today – is in hospital. Hopefully his condition isn’t serious, and I wish him a speedy recovery. The PUP leader has finally wrapped up. We are now in to questions. First question is why did you meet Jacqui Lambie at Monster? Clive says he’s committed to enhancing the cause of women’s representation. One of the important things in life is to listen to other people and Jacqui had something she wanted to say and I was more than happy to listen to her, right. It wasn’t about anything political, it was more about social things I would say rather than political things. Jacqui Lambie is a free and independent woman and we want to encourage more free and independent women to participate in politics. Chairman Mao gets a shout out. As Robert Kennedy said many years ago .. CENSORED Spending money makes the world go around, creates wealth and jobs and makes the pie bigger for all of us to share. Ok this needs to wind up now before we hit Kennedy. Oh no, hang on, here’s the co-payment. Palmer United make no mistake about it, has killed the co-payment, there will be no co-payment. Make no mistake about that. I’m sure you’ll hear more of that in the coming days and weeks ahead, but the co-payment is finished, right. After thirty five solid minutes, we’ve hit the war. Seven days ago, Jacqui Lambie resigned from our party and there’s been constant media and political pressure to destroy what we’d achieved against all odds. Glenn Lazarus, Dio Wang and myself have a high degree of commitment to continue to do our best to serve the Australian people as the largest party on the crossbench besides the Greens, who always vote with the Opposition. We have a key role to play. Senator Lambie will continue I believe to vote with Palmer United on most issues. Palmer is sending himself a herogram for his contributions to asylum policy. The PUP leader refers to his recent deal with immigration minister Scott Morrison concerning the processing of refugees. There’s a small barb for Morrison. The challenge this week as parliament sits for the last time before Christmas, is to ensure this agreement is followed through in legislation and if properly implemented will save Australia up to $3-4bn a year. I can’t improve on this observation. Palmer has moved on to declaring that the world needs an emissions trading scheme. Which begs an obvious question. Why did he abolish the emissions trading scheme that was already legislated? #JudicialVoting #FacePalmer Palmer now seems to be saying he needs an award for being a coal baron who does not mine coal. Clive on promises. Too many politicians make promises before an election only to break them after an election. Public service should be the highest calling. We have to hold our politicians to their word or the system of our democracy will fail. Stirring sentiments indeed. A little further on Palmer notes his party condemned direct action – that would be the policy the PUP voted for. The Palmer address thus far is all about PUP’s great transformative success since entering the Australian political scene. (In order to sustain this uplifting narrative, some recent history thus therefore be omitted. Perhaps we are getting there.) Palmer says PUP has used its vote in a judicial sort of way. Many Australians believe that a vote for our party was a wasted vote, that no party could be elected with members in parliament that could make a difference in such a short period of time and I think we’ve shown that’s not true – and we’ve shown by exercising our votes in a judicial sort of way we can make a difference for all Australians. PUP leader Clive Palmer rents office space at the National Press Club. Often he grabs the podium. Today is one such day. Palmer: Public service is about serving the public. History is our only reward. The folks down at the club watching this lunchtime have wine. I don’t know why I thought that relevant. Yes, I do. I’m wishing I had wine. I suspect it would help all of us get through the next half an hour. Lest we forget. The LDP senator David Leyonhjelm has been out this morning doffing his helmet to the poor oppressed bikers of Australia. Tailoring messages to your audience is a stock standard part of professional politics. But I reckon Leyonhjelm could have left his man junk out of it. Leyonhjelm: The people behind me (politicians) do not understand the joy of cruising out on the highway. In fact, very few of them have ever had anything between their legs with more grunt than a pogo stick. When put to the test, I suspect very few of them ever have much between their legs at all. Highway to hell, right there. If ever there was a man in the hot seat – Mark Scott, in estimates this morning. Lovely shot from Mr Bowers. Great, great cause. That facial hair – all kinds of wrong. Interesting development. The Labor MP Maria Vamvakinou has tabled a motion in the House of Representatives this morning recognising the 29th UN International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. She’s also called on the parliament to recognise the state of Palestine and vote yes at the UN for Palestinian Statehood. Vamvakinou: Australia and indeed this parliament must now recognise the state of Palestine and Australia must vote Yes at the UN for Palestinian statehood. ‘Operation Reset The Press Gallery Tantrum’ has chalked up another success. Phillip Coorey, The Australian Financial Review. Today was a good start to getting back in favour with voters. Bare your soul, admit you were wrong, make a few concessions and speak to them maturely. It can work wonders. (It can work wonders, if you actually do those things. Yes.) Isn’t diversity a great thing? I’ve already shared my quick take on the Abbott press conference – trouble at mill/I’d like to reposition a bit but I don’t quite know how/So I’m digging in. Dennis Shanahan at The Australian by contrast is seeing a big break through. Tony Abbott has pushed the reset button on the politics of his government. The prime minister has decided to directly address the disconnection between “fundamentals” of the government’s achievements and the “static” which portrays it as “ragged”. Instead of being evasive and apologetic Abbott has moved aggressively to reinforce the government’s aims and budget targets and banked on the public recognising “performance” and what has been achieved in “substance”. If you read over the final point in the last post on higher education – the information campaign (I do love that euphemism) – handy to reprise this recent story from my colleague Daniel Hurst. The government has spent $150k to gauge the public’s “understanding of the higher education system.” With such an investment, a-d-v-e-r-t-i-s-i-n-g generally follows. The education minister Christopher Pyne has issued a statement outlining the various compromises the government is flagging to try and persuade the PUPs and #PUPsUp and assorted others to say yes to university deregulation. The prime minister has decreed he wants this sorted this week. The debate on the package is currently underway in the Senate. Pyne: We have demonstrated a willingness to negotiate on these vital higher education reforms before the Senate. The government has agreed to the proposed amendment of Senator Bob Day to retain the consumer price index as the interest rate on Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS). We have also agreed to the proposed amendment of Senator John Madigan to introduce a five year interest rate pause on HECS for new mums and dads. We are now carefully considering other proposals from crossbenchers including: A targeted university transition fund; fee price monitoring by the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission; targeting scholarships towards rural and regional students; and an information campaign for students and potential students on how the system works and the value they get from going to university. Moving on now to catch up with bibs and bobs. Here is the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, on his trip to Monster last night with the chief PUP and the once-was-PUP. You’ll find this very illuminating. I hope you are all sitting down. Cormann: I keep in regular contact with all parties on the crossbench, including and in particular with Mr Palmer as Leader of the Palmer United Party, to discuss government measures to repair the Budget and other policy matters in the national interest. The prime minister has deployed the old Howardism this morning: press conference till you drop. John Howard always used to pull the ‘all comers all questions’ press conference when his government was in serious trouble. The basic psychology of the tussle is simple: if the press gallery is having a tantrum at your expense, then let them scream it out at you before (hopefully) retiring, spent for a nap. The purpose of the marathon press conference in the old days was a means of clearing static. Clearly Abbott is looking for a circuit breaker. Doing the press conference this morning is a billboard sized marker: we are in trouble, I know we are in trouble. But unlike in the Howard deployments, the prime minister had almost nothing substantial to say this morning. Howard’s outings were generally vehicles for significant repositioning – an unpopular policy would be dumped, a successful bout of opposition trouble would be neutralised. Abbott announced the defence pay deal, which was already known. He made a partial mea culpa on the ABC. He told folks with notepads not to blame his office for the current doldrums but perhaps blame their own addiction to soap opera (why don’t you see all these great things we are doing, why don’t you notice?) He said he wanted education tied up this week (probably, it wasn’t clear whether the higher ed package would be dumped if it couldn’t be tied up this week); he said he was committed to the GP copayment either a) forever; or b) at least until the other side of MYEFO. So it was, broadly, ‘we are digging in.’ Which makes sense. The simple fact very often overlooked in the “DO SOMETHING TONY” commentary right now is Abbott has dug himself in. Waaay in. Analysis which says the government just needs a facial and a tactical reset is, of course, correct, but only up to a point. A reset .. to what exactly? And how does Abbott reconcile the new Tony (whatever that is) to the old Tony without looking completely fraudulent? Abbott is so certain and implacable he’s actually stranded himself. Very difficult, this. The press conference is now at an end. Give me a minute and I’ll give you my take on what that all meant. The ABC’s Sabra Lane would like to know why the prime minister won’t just go to the next logical step on the ABC and admit, candidly, that he broke a promise. The prime minister isn’t going there. He responds to the other part of Lane’s question, which was on paid parental leave. Q: Is it time to revisit the paid parental leave scheme again and tweak it? His riposte is not unreasonable. Abbott: Do you think if I were to change the paid parental leave scheme that there wouldn’t be screams of broken promise? I mean, I put it to you collectively. These are very important questions. Abbott appears surprised there are so many questions this morning. On tax reform, the prime minister signals he’s back in Audit Commission territory. He’d like the states to have the power to raise their own revenue. It would be better if the states could deal with their responsibilities from own-source revenues rather than having to argue with the Commonwealth to fund their schools and their hospitals and so on. Abbott won’t answer a question about whether the next batch of submarines will come from Japan. We are weighing all of this and we will be making announcements and decisions in due course. While pretending to rule in nuclear power, the prime minister has just ruled out nuclear power. (Abbott is responding to comments from the foreign minister Julie Bishop this past weekend. She wants nuclear power back on the agenda.) Abbott clearly doesn’t. I’ve got no theological objection to (nuclear power). It’s never really been an option for Australia up till now because we don’t have the energy shortages that other countries do. We’ve got abundant coal, abundant gas, hundreds of years of reserves of coal, hundreds of years of reserves of gas. We want to reduce our emissions and we will under our Direct Action policy. If someone wants to put a proposal for nuclear energy generation here in Australia, fine, but don’t expect a government subsidy. If it’s going to happen, it’s going to happen because it is economically feasible, not because the government runs around offering a subsidy. (Nuclear is only possible in terms of its economic viability via two methods: a carbon price or subsidies. The government has axed the carbon price and Abbott has just ruled out subsidies. Thanks Julie but no thanks.) Q: Why can’t the government sell its message and is the way you do it being reviewed and how much responsibility do you take? Well, obviously I take responsibility for everything in the end. I mean, the buck stops here. That’s the way it is in our democracy. The buck stops with the party leader. In respect of the government, the buck stops with me so I take full responsibility. The prime minister is also standing by his office. (I mentioned earlier there were all sorts of hate filled beat downs on the prime minister’s office this past weekend. This PMO is extremely unpopular across the board both within the government and with members of the press, because of their tendency to engage in self sabotage and periodic bouts of school yard vindictiveness. But it is ludicrous to blame the office when it’s completely clear that the problem is the content of the government’s program, the broken promises and evasions, and the man doing talking right now – the prime minister. If the voters don’t buy the frontman then it’s pointless to scapegoat the backroom.) Abbott: The first thing to say is that I stand by my office. It’s a very good office. My office is essentially the same office that got us from nowhere to election parity in 2010 and gave us a very strong victory in 2013. Let’s not forget where we were as a party and as a Coalition in 2009. In December 2009, the Liberal Party was on the verge of splitting, the Coalition was on the verge of breaking. We went to within a whisker of winning the 2010 election. We performed strongly throughout that term of parliament and we had a very emphatic victory in 2013 and the office that I have now is essentially the same office that I had throughout that period so I stand by my office, I stand by all the senior members of my office. (Take that cabinet colleagues.) The prime minister says the key barnacle of the week will be the higher education package. He wants this sorted this week. Look, we are continuing to talk with all members of the cross bench. I don’t presume to know what the final outcome will be but we are determined to deal with this matter one way or another in this final sitting week of the year. There is an overwhelming view from the universities of Australia, an absolutely overwhelming view from the universities of Australia, from the so-called great 8 to the regional universities, there is an overwhelming view amongst all of them that these changes should go through, that these changes will, in the short, medium and long-term, strengthen our university sector and ultimately help students. So I do hope that the cross benchers, all of them, are listening long and hard to the vice chancellors of Australia. (Group of Eight I believe, prime minister. I’m sure they’d agree they are the Great Eight, but it’s not their actual title.) Let the angels rejoice. The prime minister has finally decided to fess up on the ABC. Abbott: I accept what we are doing with the ABC is at odds with what I said immediately prior to the election – but things have moved on. Mea culpa sorta. Q: Prime minister, you were talking about parts of Plan A being in some trouble in the Senate. How long do you persist in trying to get those measures through somehow or other? If they are not through by the end of the sittings, will you still include those savings in the mid-year forecasts? When do you give up on them, and if you give up on them, do you have to find alternative savings to make up? Is that part of Plan B? Tony Abbott: The general rule is we persist with the budget measure as announced until such time as an alternative is agreed in the Senate or an alternative way forward is established. That’s why we are totally committed to the Medicare co-payment that was announced on budget. I know it may well have trouble with the cross benchers and let’s see what, in the end, we come up with. But we are committed to the policy that we announced until we decide that there is an alternative way forward which, under all of the circumstances, makes sense. The circumstances obviously include the particular composition of the Senate at the moment. Abbott is asked about the GP copayment. Is it still Coalition policy or not? The prime minister: Plainly there are some things which are going to have a lot of difficulty in the Senate. We stand by them. We absolutely stand by them. But, if plan A is in trouble, obviously you contemplate a potential plan B. But as far as I’m concerned, I want Plan A implemented because that is the right plan, that is the best plan. When something goes before the Senate, you might decide that rather than having the best, you’ve got to have something which is better but not quite as good as what you wanted. That’s the kind of thing that I was alluding to when I said we would be taking the barnacles off before Christmas. (KM decoding the prime minister decoding the barnacles. Possibly the GP copayment is still Coalition policy but it probably isn’t Coalition policy. We are astride the barbed wire fence and for now, we’ll hover there.) A point of substance. Abbott says the extra funds for defence will have to come out of existing resources. There won’t be extra money put in so the chief of the defence force will have to find the money. That’s $17m he won’t have for other purposes. (Happy Christmas.) Abbott has also read the weekend assessments of the performance of his government. I’d like, if I may, to take some of those head on. (By all means.) Abbott thinks any serious analysis of the substance of this past year would reach a thumbs up. We should not be so preoccupied with appearances, although the prime minister acknowledges appearances do matter. Abbott: I do believe that by any reasonable measure, this has been a year of very considerable achievement for the government. It’s been a year when this government has demonstrated guts, commitment and strength of character on a whole host of issues, whether it be MH17 or responding to the closure down the track of Holden and Toyota. (Responding to the closure? I think the government played a pretty significant role in the closure. Nit picking.) Back to Abbott: On all of these issues, I think the government has shown considerable courage and strength of character. I also think that, notwithstanding the political difficulties that we have had in the Senate, we have very significantly achieved the items that we went to the election on. The carbon tax is gone. The mining tax is gone. The boats are stopping. The roads are building. The budget is coming into better shape. Three free trade agreements that have been successfully negotiated will set our country up for the long-term. I really do think that this has been a year of very substantial achievement. I know that appearances do count and I concede that the appearance last week was a bit ragged but, in the end, nothing matters more than performance and this is a government which has a very solid year of performance under its belt. Tony Abbott has opened his press conference today with the matter of defence pay. The prime minister confirms the story the government gave the News Corp tabloids over the weekend. Allowances will stay. Abbott: First of all, defence pay. Obviously I have enormous respect for the professionalism, for the courage, for the tasks that our defence force personnel do. I don’t think anyone would have more respect than I do for all of that. All of us would like to see our defence forces paid more but what’s possible with a $20 billion surplus is not always possible with a $40bn deficit. I think we just have to be realistic about defence force pay. Nevertheless, I can announce this morning that the government is not proceeding with the changes to allowances that were announced with the defence force pay. Suffice to say, Mark Scott is getting a hard time in estimates. Our media reporter, Amanda Meade is covering this appearance and I’ll link you to her news story later. I’m going to need to turn my attention shortly to the prime minister, who will shortly address reporters in his courtyard. Ooo look more friends. The finance minister Mathias Cormann has joined the party at Monster. What can it mean? Something? Nothing? Both? (Monster is the name of the restaurant. Gridlock always goes better with a nice Canberra pinot.) The ABC boss Mark Scott is in Canberra for an estimates hearing this morning. I’ll tune into that for a bit shortly. Shorten has bobbed up at a solar event, analysing Tony Abbott. I just don’t think he gets science. He is not a modern person. There has been a deal of speculation and reportage over the weekend about whether the education minister Christopher Pyne can salvage his higher education reforms. A couple of compromises have been floated and framed in a positive light – meaning, these compromises might make passage more likely. This is the Senate, so the working proposition is always anything can happen, and it usually does. But my colleague Daniel Hurst, who keeps a very close eye on matters education, is not so sure the education package will be a thumbs up by week’s end. Yesterday, the crossbench was looking decidedly mulish. Here’s Daniel: The PUP – which has two crossbench votes in the Senate – and its former member, Jacqui Lambie, indicated they would not be persuaded to support the higher education bill, which included cuts to course subsidies and ending caps on student fees. Their three votes would be enough to defeat the bill, because Labor and the Greens are firmly opposed to the legislation. A fourth crossbench senator, Nick Xenophon, ruled out voting for the bill in the next four days, saying a decision should be deferred to February to allow further talks on suitable amendments. As is noted periodically in the classics, only time will tell. There are no secrets in Canberra. Just one small pedant’s point before we surf into the morning. I referenced in the opening post the foreign minister Julie Bishop’s interview on Radio National this morning. During the course of that interview Bishop described the government’s GP copayments as a saving. She was pushed on this point by her host Fran Kelly – it’s not actually a saving is it when you are spending all the revenue on the new medical research fund? Bishop: It’s considered a saving. I’ve gone back to the budget papers as the authoritative source. Page 133 and 134, Budget Paper Number 2. The government will achieve saving of $3.5bn over five years by reducing the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) rebates from 1 July 2015 by $5 for standard general practitioner consultations and out of hospital pathology and diagnostic imaging services and allowing the providers of these services to collect a patient contribution of $7 per service. The savings from this measure will be invested by the government in the Medical Research Future Fund. In one pocket, out of the other. Not really a saving then, is it? Meanwhile, I’ve decided to award dork of the morning to Bill Shorten, who has actually said, on the radio .. I thought denial was a river in Egypt .. (He did. Truly. How on earth does he think this nonsense is grown up political communication?) Good morning blogans, bloganistas, and welcome to the final parliamentary sitting week of 2014. Today’s weather forecast is murky with a high chance of absurd. We are not only in the final sitting week of the year, we are also closing in on the mid-point of the Abbott government’s first term in office. (I know, right? Time sure flies in a parallel universe.) It’s the Monday after the weekend’s Victorian election – a development which has plastered cheeky Cheshire Cat like grins on the faces of Labor MPs returning for the closing act of shout fest. It’s been a character forming weekend for Abbott and for the federal coalition. Last parliamentary week was a shocker. The weekend papers were initially full of commentary declaring how terrible the prime minister’s office was and how dreadful the policy sell job was (as if the content of what’s being sold doesn’t matter.) The random acts of rhetorical violence against Tony Abbott’s backroom were then replaced on Sunday with the predictable free advice to the prime minister about steps he might take to avoid being a ‘one term Coalition government’ like poor old Denis Napthine. MPs are still busy this morning spinning the wash-up of the Victorian poll. Daniel Andrews’ victory is, variously, all Tony Abbott’s fault, or not Tony Abbott’s fault given the government in Canberra has clearly put in the best performance by a new government in a musical. Foreign minister Julie Bishop, on ABC Radio National Breakfast just a moment ago, walking a middle course on the developments down south. It’s obviously a very complex result. To other issues. There’s a new forecast around from Deloitte Access Economics which shows the budget is in trouble. Given many of the contentious measures unveiled in May have disappeared without trace in the Senate, and nobody has a coherent strategy at this point at least to contemplate serious fiscal repair, this assessment should surprise absolutely no-one. Labor and the once-was-PUP Senator Jacqui Lambie are keeping the pressure on the government on the issue of defence pay. The Labor leader Bill Shorten has been on the radio playing with the Team Australia concept: Tony Abbott loves to talk about team Australia but he’s refusing to pay the team. (Zing.) The News Corp tabloids reported at the weekend the prime minister would write to the Defence Remuneration Tribunal in an effort to overturn a decision to scrap entitlements for soldiers under the new, controversial 1.5% pay deal. The deadline to do that is today. Let’s stride forward into today’s nonsense with confidence – let’s do the Lego firewalk.

Not exactly. Nigel Farage cheerfully admits to his participation in the Great Euro-Gravy Train robbery to the tune of £2m of expenses since 1999 – far more than Ronnie Biggs managed from his 1963 caper. Some fellow-Kipper MEPs do even better, and all this on top of their £79k salaries in a job they all despise, especially the work bit. One was jailed for fraud (£36k diverted to cars and wine), another for benefit fiddling (£65k). That's an even higher proportion than Labour considering Ukip currently has seven MEPs, after losing six to pub sulks and defections since 2009. • Not convinced? Then take a look at the online battle raging at Cupwith reservoir, on the moorland outside Huddersfield, between locals and William Legge, aka the 10th Earl of Dartmouth (which makes him Princess Di's stepbrother). A Kipper MEP for South West England, he's also a Yorkshire landowner. At stake is a planning application to build a windfarm (each turbine worth £20k a year in rent to its landlord), which critics say makes Legge a hypocrite since Ukip opposes wind nonsense. Harried by activists and a tenacious blogger called Autonomous Mind (they keep finding Legge's name linked to labyrinthine company structures involved), Legge finally abandoned his Maria Miller posture this week. \"The land is owned by a relative,\" he conceded. But who? • A less controversial peer, Labour's Viscount Simon, asked yesterday if it is true (the BBC reported it, so it must be) that Britain has \"the largest production and consumption of baked beans in the world\", and whether what Lord S called \"the smelly emission resulting therefrom\" formed part of the government's climate change calculations? An important point, replied Lady Verma cryptically: \"We need to moderate our behaviour.\" Wot? No windfarm? • When our celeb culture sustains a casualty like Peaches Geldof, the media behaves like a rubbernecking motorist at an M1 crash rather than the lorry near the front of the pile-up whose driver has escaped unhurt (again). Yet some celebs survive it all. After eight wives, three bankruptcies, drink, drugs and 340 films, Mickey Rooney was prematurely carried off this week at 93. He even survived playing Baron Hardup in panto at 89 – in Milton Keynes too. • The Daily Mail, which rarely leaves a feud untended, joined forces this week with the Real IRA to deplore (over five pages) the decision to make the Queen dine with ex-IRA gunman Martin (White Tie) McGuinness, in honour of Ireland's pixie president Michael D Higgins, at Windsor. The spirit of reconciliation has not yet permeated Catholic Voices, a Vatican-backed social media enterprise, where an activist who tweets as Madame Ratzinger (naughty, that's Pope Benedict's surname) has just belatedly resigned after remarking that \"all fags are mentally ill\", and that the IRA might care to bomb a Northern Ireland abortion centre. Also unmoved by the Windsor love-in and the McGuinness white tie is the National Trust for Ireland. It has just won the right to challenge the new nuclear power station across the water at Hinkley Point. Doesn't Dublin realise it's Chinese investors they're taking on now? • The backlash begins. Steve Pound, the lovable Labour MP for Ealing North, remembers Maria Miller as \"top Tory totty\" (and a moderate) in their LSE days. Nor is she the first Tory highflying MP for Basingstoke to come a cropper. Denzil Freeth (1924-2010) quietly resigned a promising ministerial career in 1964 after being classed a possible security risk in the wake of the Profumo scandal and panic. Gay? Possibly. The past is another country. • Irrepressible ex-MP and HMP Brixton graduate Denis MacShane, is telling French 'acks that he introduced his ex-assistant Axelle Lemaire, new digital economy minister in Paris, to François Hollande in 2007 as a future president. \"Not before me, I hope, Denis,\" the scooter lover quipped.

The party conference in Glasgow in September will tackle myriad controversial issues in which there are likely to be passionate differences of opinion and may therefore be taken as a litmus test of the party's political mood. The event will consider a pre-manifesto strategy paper that examines the extent to which the party should enthusiastically own the decisions made by the coalition, rather than highlighting the extent to which the Lib Dems were unable to get their way as the minority party alongside the Tories. The strategy paper, with a foreword by Clegg, insists the party was right to join the coalition and lists some of Conservative plans it has blocked. Clegg's aides argue that the party cannot sensibly advertise the virtues of coalition politics to the electorate if the party is excessively critical of the party's achievements between 2010 and 2015. They believe he is in a strong position to press members to accept that its strategic future lies in the centre ground, even though polls show Lib Dem supporters would prefer a coalition with Labour rather than the Conservatives by a margin of two to one. On Trident, the motion to conference is expected to call for the party to back the replacement of the current four Trident nuclear submarines with two or three submarines, depending on whether it is possible to construct a new class of dual-use submarine as part of a larger submarine fleet. The idea was explored in this week's Cabinet Office-led review into the replacement for Trident, overseen by the Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander. Labour, to the surprise of some Liberal Democrats, has been scathing this week about the Cabinet Office review and has said a continuous at-sea nuclear deterrence is non-negotiable for the party. The shadow defence minister, Kevan Jones, told MPs Labour would only support going down from four to three submarines if changes in technology make the nuclear submarines more reliable. The former armed forces minister Sir Nick Harvey was scathing about the Labour-Tory consensus in the Commons on Thursday, saying: \"Just getting so many dinosaurs in one place at one time does not mean the dinosaurs will live for ever\".The conference will also see a clash over nuclear power with a paper on climate change giving a straight choice between continued opposition to any new nuclear power stations and the coalition position of allowing new nuclear as long as it does not require any state subsidy. The conference voted to oppose new nuclear power in 2009, so the energy secretary Ed Davey has a challenge to persuade the party to adopt a more flexible approach. He is likely to argue that his still to be completed negotiations over strike price with EDF the French nuclear company due to invest in new nuclear stations at Hinkley Point show he will not roll over and agree a price that amounts to a subsidy. Davey will be hoping that the green movement in his party, faced by the threat of climate change, recognises that one more generation of nuclear stations are necessary before it can be replaced by renewable technology. The conference will examine a paper on higher education that includes a de facto endorsement of the coalition's decision to treble tuition fees as a way of injecting cash into university sector. The Lib Dem conference has not formally accepted the coalition decision. Clegg last week published an economic motion for the conference that endorses the existing economic strategy, but calls for fresh measures to help 16- to 24-year-olds; allow councils to pool borrowing limits to increase house building; expand the British business bank; increase RBS lending to businesses; and making the Green Investment Bank fully independent. It also says the government should explore allowing councils to borrow more without the cost appearing in public borrowing statistics. The Social Liberal Forum pressure group this week questioned the motion's approach, saying the party must not be seen to be endorsing chancellor George Osborne's fiscal policy, which it described as a compromise \"made for the purposes of this coalition,\" It states: \"The only party going into that election defending Osbornomics should be the Conservative party\". It is not yet clear whether an amendment will be tabled to the motion"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2013/nov/07/pandoras-promise-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-07T22:15:01Z","webTitle":"Pandora's Promise – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/07/pandoras-promise-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2013/nov/07/pandoras-promise-review","fields":{"headline":"Pandora's Promise – review","bodyText":"The environmentalist case for nuclear power? For most progressives, it's like hearing \"the liberal case for the death penalty\". A contradiction in terms, surely? Well, readers of this paper will already know about the new ideas being ventilated on this issue from George Monbiot's writings. This documentary, from Robert Stone, sets out to think the unthinkable and ask the unaskable: should we learn to stop worrying and love nuclear energy? Stone's case is that it has been massively misunderstood and misrepresented by a 60s generation of environmentalists: he argues that nuclear is a hugely efficient and relatively clean energy source that is now vitally needed as billions of people in emerging economies such as India, China and Brazil are hungry for power. Wind turbines and solar panels, he says, are failing to meet even a fraction of urgent needs. But the film has been criticised for deriding wind and solar energy unduly. Perhaps the film could have spent longer on safety – and it is a little glib in its dismissal of the issue. Holding up the Geiger counter at a disaster site and showing the surprisingly low number is a bit obtuse and smug, and doesn't address people's fears about an explosion. The anti-nuclear protesters are compared to climate-change deniers because of their dismissal of science: actually, some of the smooth pro-nuclear rhetoric sounded like that of the climate sceptics. This film certainly chops up a few sacred cows.

There was a big, largely ignored settlement agreement by two of the industry's biggest players, Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital. The settlement, as quiet as it has been, is small: only $121m for both firms, a relatively modest sum, considering the billions of dollars that move through their offices regularly. Yet it may mark a real change in the inner workings of private equity, a part of the financial industry that has managed to hold itself above the fray of financial crises. The settlement is also likely to signal a new wave of aggressive prosecutorial tactics coming to an industry that rarely finds regulators poking into its business. It helps to understand the background. Private equity is, to most Americans, only vaguely familiar as the industry in which Mitt Romney made his fortune. However, its true importance to the modern economy is far greater than as a historian’s footnote to the 2012 presidential campaign. How private equity makes money Private equity is predicated on a simple business model: the private equity managers raise money from investors seeking high returns: primarily public pension funds providing retirement benefits to teachers, police officers, and other government employees, as well as university endowments. The managers use their financial expertise to find struggling or undervalued companies in need of restructuring. The private equity firms buy the companies with a combination of cash and debt, arranged through banks. Then the trick is to try to turn around the businesses, called \"portfolio companies\", so that their cash flow can pay back the debt and make a little profit. For their effort, private equity firms charge their investors and companies fees for the work they do, including a share of the profits, which is known as \"carried interest\". Some private equity investments are great successes, and others less so. Private equity is a hit-or-miss business. When it works, it makes billions of dollars for the private equity investors and the people who invested in them, ensuring monthly retirement checks to your favorite third-grade teacher, Mrs Crabapple. When it goes bad, the companies can't be turned around and they face closure. A notable example is the largest leveraged buyout of all time, which is now the pending bankruptcy of coal-and-nuclear power plant company Energy Future Holdings, owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Texas Pacific Group and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners. Private equity has established itself as a key element of the modern economy, controlling large sums of money. Temptations to cut corners no doubt abound. It is no wonder that the industry has drawn the attention of prosecutors and regulators. Another reason for the attention: involved in the lawsuit are some of the biggest names in finance – Blackstone Group, Carlyle Group, KKR, Silver Lake Partners and TPG Capital Management – although they remain opaque to the average consumer. If they don't settle, they'll be on trial 3 November. Allegations of collusion The lawsuit, which was filed all the way back in December 2007, alleges that a number of leading private equity firms illegally colluded on prices when trying to acquire portfolio companies during the “boom years” that preceded the financial crisis in 2008. The elements of collusion are relatively easy to understand. It's about “bid rigging”. Imagine an episode of Storage Wars: it would be unethical if the bidders agreed amongst themselves not to go over a certain preset price they themselves chose. The seller doesn't get the price he wants, and other bidders don't have a chance to break the blockade. The auction is, in effect, fixed. Whether or not this actually happened in private equity will be hard for prosecutors to prove. Even with wiretapping, lawyers may find themselves out of luck. Where is the “smoking gun” communication where the parties agreed on the collusive plan or even the ceiling price that they wouldn’t go over? How would you establish for a jury the key elements of the case? Regardless of how this particular case gets resolved in the months to come, we will likely see this as the beginning of a larger wave of investigations, prosecutions and litigation involving private equity funds. To date, US prosecutors have been much more focused on hedge funds – private equity’s “cousins” among the alternative asset classes – and have had great success in building a series of insider trading cases that have rocked the hedge fund industry to its foundations. By using investigative techniques commonly found in organized crime cases, such as wiretaps, federal prosecutors, including Preet Bharara, have gained numerous convictions and a media profile of enforcers and heroes – whether that title is deserved or not. The peace in private equity is over From now on, the question will be not whether prosecutors will apply these hard-crime techniques to other parts of the financial industry; it's only a question of how and when. The use of wiretapping, witness-turning and other more aggressive case-building techniques won't go away any time soon. What is clear, however, is that the peace over the private equity industry is over. For so long as private equity remains a pivotal part of Wall Street, the industry cannot be surprised by the attention that it attracts. Private equity firms and the large public pension plans that back them must prepare themselves for heightened scrutiny. Arguably, this could eventually make things better for both the investors who entrust their money to private equity funds and the private equity firms themselves, at least to the extent that they are able to portray themselves to court of public opinion as “clean” and “rule-abiding” organizations. Private equity firms need to realize that this is not a short-term issue, but rather a significant change in their liability profile. They must be vigilant in policing themselves and ensuring that they are compliant with the long list of laws, rules and regulations to which they are subject.

The House of Commons public accounts committee has already given it the thumbs down. So has the National Audit Office. The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, ironically used the Freedom of Information Act to veto publication of an HS2 review by the cabinet office's Major Projects Authority, presumably because he didn't like what it said. Now the Commons environmental audit committee has produced a devastating critique of the scheme's environmental aspects. The proposal to establish \"a high-speed rail network\" appears in the environment section of the coalition agreement, published on 12 May 2010. The committee's report comprehensively demolishes any green pretensions HS2 may once have had. It dismisses with withering scorn the idea that you can offset the biodiversity loss involved in the destruction of an ancient woodland, which may have been in place for hundreds of years, simply by planting trees somewhere else. As far as HS2's contribution to the reductions in CO2 emissions is concerned, the committee concludes: \"There is some debate about whether HS2 will deliver a reduction in emissions by taking travellers off the roads and planes. But at best, the savings are likely to be relatively small.\" The faster a train goes, the more energy it needs. An HS2 train travelling at 225 mph would use three times as much energy as an Intercity train travelling at 125 mph. According to the committee's report, HS2 \"told us that the possibility of lower train operation speeds had not been considered\". Happily, the committee makes good that omission by recommending that \"the government should examine the scope for requiring a reduced maximum speed for the trains until electricity generation has been sufficiently decarbonised\". If anything is a killer paragraph, this is it. Decoded, it means that the committee is in practice recommending that high-speed trains should run at normal speeds, since nobody realistically imagines (short of a massive switch to nuclear power) that electricity generation is going to be \"decarbonised\" in the foreseeable future. But if high-speed trains are to run at normal speeds, why do we need them at all? The committee points out that it did not \"examine the economic case for HS2 and we make no judgment about that in this report\". It also clearly states that it does not \"examine the environmental or community issues for particular parts of the route\". This admission is extremely significant. By omitting any consideration of HS2 and the urban environment, the committee closed its eyes to the fact that the most significant environmental impacts are likely to be felt not in the countryside (important though any loss of habitat and wildlife may be), but in the cities. This is all the more surprising since both Camden council and Hillingdon council, in their submissions to the committee, pointed out the tremendous impact on the local environment and on the health and wellbeing of large numbers of people that will be caused by years, even decades, of construction and disturbance. Road closures, lorry movements, noise, vibration, waste creation and disposal, and especially air pollution – all these add up to a damning social and environmental indictment. On 28 April, parliament will have a second reading of the HS2 bill. After that a select committee will be established to hear petitions. Those who live in Camden, as I do, are not much encouraged by the bullish talk being heard in certain quarters of the need to build a new \"world-class\" Euston station with a landgrab several times larger than the current proposal, which is already overly ambitious. I am always suspicious of \"world-class\" installations. Who needs them? I am sure Camden residents will be quite content with some modest improvements – or none at all. If there is to be a new Euston station, we want it to be \"within the existing footprint\". Does that mean that some would-be developers will make less money? Well, maybe it does. Tant pis. Most of all, we want HS2 to be put back in its box, with the lid nailed firmly shut. But that is something for parliament to decide."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2012/mar/04/areva-competition-inquiry-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-04T19:20:55Z","webTitle":"Areva could face competition inquiry if it wins UK nuclear power contract","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/04/areva-competition-inquiry-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/mar/04/areva-competition-inquiry-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"headline":"Areva could face competition inquiry if it wins UK nuclear power contract","bodyText":"Areva, the French state-owned nuclear power group, faces the threat of a competition investigation by the European commission if it wins a hotly-contested contract to build UK reactors. Detailed legal documents drafted by a competitor and seen by the Guardian state that Areva will secure a market monopoly which should trigger a sector inquiry if the company wins the contest to build a reactor at the Wylfa site on Anglesey. Horizon, the British nuclear joint venture owned by the German power groups E.ON and RWE, is also planning a reactor for Oldbury in Gloucestershire. Horizon will decide the winner of the competition for Wylfa, in which Westinghouse, owned by Toshiba of Japan, is bidding against Areva. The document argues that awarding the contract to the world's largest reactor builder will have a detrimental effect on UK jobs. \"It will have a permanent and significantly negative impact on the UK nuclear industry, jobs, manufacturing skills, supply chains and SMEs. Westinghouse have pledged to 'buy where they build' and source 70% UK content, Areva have existing supply chains in France and their UK commitment would be significantly less.\" The document also warns that an Areva win would tie up the British nuclear market because France's state-owned EdF, a minority shareholder in Areva, is the dominant player in the UK nuclear sector. When EdF took over British Energy in 2008, it was ordered to divest the Wylfa and Oldbury sites that could house Areva reactors if they are built. \"If … Horizon select an Areva reactor for the Wylfa power station, then Areva would have complete dominance in the UK nuclear reactor market. Given EdF and Areva's common ownership, EdF would have the same control of UK nuclear sites as [when] it was made to divest the sites at Wylfa and Oldbury in 2008.\" Adding that Areva is already the reactor choice for EdF, the document states: \"If Areva are the reactor choice for Horizon this would foreclose the market to competition.\" A source close to the bidding contest said US-based Westinghouse was attempting to persuade Barack Obama to raise concerns over the process with David Cameron. A decision on who will build the Wylfa reactor is due this month. An Areva spokesman declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2014/jun/16/scottish-constitution-first-draft-issued-nicola-sturgeon","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-16T14:14:47Z","webTitle":"SNP publishes draft of first constitution for an independent Scotland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/16/scottish-constitution-first-draft-issued-nicola-sturgeon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/jun/16/scottish-constitution-first-draft-issued-nicola-sturgeon","fields":{"headline":"SNP publishes draft of first constitution for an independent Scotland","bodyText":"A draft of the first constitution for an independent Scotland, legally asserting the sovereignty of the Scottish people but with the Queen as head of state, has been published by the SNP administration in Edinburgh. The constitution commits the country to enshrine the European convention on human rights in law, tackle climate change and ensure the safe, \"expeditious\" removal of Trident nuclear weapons. It would be the first written constitution for any part of the UK. Its opening line is: \"In Scotland, the people are sovereign.\" The constitution is designed to be a temporary \"skeleton\" version that would come into force if Scotland becomes independent in March 2016. It was released on Monday by Scotland's deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, for consultation in a draft independence bill. It confirms that the saltire will continue to serve as the national flag of Scotland and that the choice of national anthem will be made by the Scottish parliament. The highly symbolic move came as the leaders of the three main pro-UK parties published a rare joint declaration promising that Scots would quickly win significant new tax and welfare powers if they voted no in September's referendum. With the polls tightening, both sides in the debate are revealing more details about their vision for Scotland after the referendum in the hope of winning round the remaining undecided voters. Sturgeon said the draft bill setting out the constitution was an essential part of the Scottish government's blueprint for independence and would be the first written constitution for any part of the UK. Britain, unlike other comparable countries, has no codified political system. \"We in the Scottish government are clear that the constitution – with a capital 'C' as it were – is fundamental to, and not different from, the range of issues with which governments deal day in and day out,\" Sturgeon said in a speech at Edinburgh University. She said the outline constitution would be a short-term measure, and would be replaced by a full, permanent constitution written by an independent constitutional convention in the years following the first elections, in 2016, after leaving the UK. Sturgeon said enshrining the sovereign will of the people gave legal meaning to the nationalists' major complaint about the structure of the UK, where parties without a mandate from Scottish voters could make laws which affected them. She said a full constitution would embody \"the values of the nation\", secure citizens' rights and provide \"a clear distinction between the state and the government of the day, and guarantees a relationship of respect and trust between the institutions of the nation and its people\". The document also promises to: • protect and enhance the environment; • take particular account of the needs of Scottish islands; • observe international law in its foreign policy; • give citizenship to anyone \"habitually resident in Scotland and with a UK passport, or to the children of Scottish citizens; • and guarantee to safeguard and support the wellbeing of children, defined as those under 18. The leaders of the pro-UK parties in Scotland – Johann Lamont of Labour, Ruth Davidson of the Tories and the Lib Dem Willie Rennie – made their announcement from Calton Hill overlooking the Scottish government's headquarters in Edinburgh. Their joint statement echoed the draft constitution's reference to popular sovereignty in its opening line: \"Power lies with the Scottish people and we believe it is for the Scottish people to decide how we are governed.\" The three parties have all made pledges to give the Holyrood parliament greater powers over income tax, housing benefit and other minor benefits, but will not agree a specific joint proposal until they have put their different plans to voters at the 2015 UK general election. Environment, anti-nuclear and constitutional reform campaigners welcomed the draft constitution because it gave voters more certainty about life after a yes vote, but warned it still left significant and unexpected loopholes. However, the document fails to enact measures promised by ministers, including ruling out further nuclear power stations in Scotland, or to propose concrete steps to cut climate emissions. It rules out Scotland having a new supreme court – giving the current judiciary greater power to set and decide law, and does not promise to veto using nuclear weapons in Nato. It also confirms repeatedly that Scottish law is subject to the European courts and international law. It does not set out any new or special protections for religious faiths beyond a general right to equality. The Scottish government had originally ruled out publishing a draft constitution until after a yes vote and the 2016 Scottish election, to avoid complex and divisive disputes between different interest groups and lawyers. But, with opinion polls suggesting the race is now tightening, the yes campaign is now driving hard to win centre-left votes and believes a promised constitution could influence wavering voters. Elliot Bulmer, of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, who previously wrote a draft Scottish constitution which heavily influenced Scottish ministers, said the proposals for drawing up a permanent constitution were too open-ended, with no target date for it to be in place. He warned that it failed to close a loophole where the monarch could still technically refuse to sign off a contentious bill, or set clear rules on how it could be changed or scrapped. He said: \"This would have been the perfect opportunity to close loopholes like can the Queen refuse to assent to legislation? If we're doing this from scratch, why wouldn't you take the opportunity to fix these things?\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2013/nov/10/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-10T21:00:00Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/nov/10/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2013/nov/10/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• The caption on a photograph taken inside the No 4 reactor building at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, operated by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), said that it showed \"Tepco employees wearing protective suits inspect[ing] a fuel handling machine\".

The Clicking Clean report praised six companies – Apple, Box, Facebook, Google, Rackspace and Salesforce – for committing to power their data centres with 100% renewable energy. Apple in particular had cleaned up its energy profile, Greenpeace International said. But Amazon Web Services, which provides a cloud platform for Netflix, Tumblr and Pinterest, was singled out for being secretive about its energy use, and for siting data centres in areas that rely heavily on coal. The company lagged \"far behind its major competitors, with zero reporting of its energy or environmental footprint to any source or stakeholder\", the report said. Twitter and Oracle were also faulted. Microsoft and Yahoo received middling grades in the report, which looked at energy use by 300 tech companies. Electricity use by data centres is one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions globally, as more people come online. Internet data traffic is expected to triple between 2012 and 2017, Greenpeace said. Companies like Google, Facebook and Apple have built their own clean data centres and pushed for more of that electricity to come from wind and solar power. But not Amazon, which provides a cloud to many well-known online brands including Netflix, Pinterest, Spotify, Tumblr and Vine, Greenpeace said. \"Amazon has been undergoing quite explosive growth. They are providing a huge part of the infrastructure for the internet,\" said Gary Cook, technology campaigner for Greenpeace. \"But if you look at their data centres, their heaviest concentration is in Virginia which has a very dirty energy grid. They have really done nothing at this point to try to leverage their buying power to secure clean energy.\" At peak times in the evening, streaming of Netflix and YouTube combined accounts for about 50% of US internet traffic. Much of that traffic is being moved along by electricity coming from coal. In Virginia, the east coast hub of Amazon's operation with 10 data centres, the company gets just 2% of its electricity from renewable sources. Nearly 40% of its electricity is generated by coal, Greenpeace said. The findings are estimates; Amazon did not provide data about its electricity demand. Twitter also received failing grades for failing to disclose its electricity use, despite going public last year. The company rents space in data centres. While it has expanded its footprint in a Sacramento, California data centre with a relatively clean electricity mix, Twitter has also moved into Georgia, a state that relies heavily on coal and nuclear power. The report said Twitter had made no public effort to buy renewable energy for its data centre, or push electricity providers to provide a cleaner mix of fuels. An Amazon spokesperson disputed the report, saying Greenpeace \"misses the mark by using false assumptions on AWS operations and inaccurate data on AWS energy consumption\". However, Amazon did not address the central criticism of the Greenpeace report about its refusal to disclose energy use - as other tech companies now do. The spokesperson argued that the use of Amazon's big data centres in itself saved electricity - and lessened the carbon footprint of computing. \"Running IT infrastructure on the AWS Cloud is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing that depends on small, inefficient, and over-provisioned datacenters.\" Carolyn Penner, a spokeswoman for Twitter, said: \"Twitter believes strongly in energy efficiency and optimisation of resources for minimal environmental impact. As we build out our infrastructure, we continue to strive for even greater efficiency of operations.\" Greenpeace is pressing Twitter and Amazon to follow the lead of Apple, Facebook and Google and press electricity companies to invest in wind and solar. Facebook had located a data centre in Iowa, ensuring it was powered by wind turbines. In Utah, eBay disconnected its data centre from the grid and brought in fuel cells, powered by natural gas. \"They [Twitter and Amazon] could totally do the same thing,\" Cook said. The report also criticised tech companies for their support and their membership of the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec). Alec has been pushing for legislation that would impose fees on homeowners who install solar panels, and roll back clean energy standards in many states. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, eBay, and Verizon Terremark are members of the group."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2013/oct/22/inside-guardian-weekly-fukushima-graham-snowdon","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-22T16:05:47Z","webTitle":"Inside the 25 October edition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/oct/22/inside-guardian-weekly-fukushima-graham-snowdon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2013/oct/22/inside-guardian-weekly-fukushima-graham-snowdon","fields":{"headline":"Inside the 25 October edition","bodyText":"The environmental fallout from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster in 2011 has been well documented, but less obvious is the terrible physical and mental toll the tsunami-induced meltdown has taken on the workers charged with repairing the damage. As the cleanup operation moves well into its third year, the Guardian's Tokyo correspondent Justin McCurry visited the stricken site for our cover story this week, discovering that anxiety and alcoholism are far greater threats to the health of Tepco workers than excess exposure to radiation. Notwithstanding this sad tale, energy production is a theme recurring frequently in this week's paper. Inside, Le Monde reports from China, where the country is ramping up its hydropower capability on a scale unseen anywhere else in the world (and with a population displacement few countries would be able to tolerate). As Britain announced it would build its first new nuclear power station for 20 years, it was also a week in which Iran signalled the possibility of significant concessions over its internationally controversial atomic energy programme. And in our International development pages, Guardian environment correspondent John Vidal has a special report from the Niger Delta, where illegal siphoning of oil pipelines is happening at huge social and environmental cost to Nigeria. An interesting mash-up of news and perspectives on a global energy debate that has long-term consequences for us all.

Labour confirmed that the UK will leave the EU if it wins the election after Corbyn repeatedly refused to give that assurance in a BBC interview. (See 3.44pm) Corbyn has disowned a claim he made in an interview yesterday that he intended to stay on as Labour leader even if he lost the election. (See 4.21pm) Theresa May faces opposition from within her own party as well as energy suppliers to her plans to cap gas and electricity prices. Theresa May’s husband Philip revealed that she had wanted to be prime minister for more than a decade since joining the shadow cabinet, during his first broadcast interview on BBC1’s the One Show. Trying to appear less robotic is not the only challenge the prime minister had had today. She’s been on the back foot after announcing a plan to limit energy bills. My colleagues Adam Vaughan and Rowena Mason report that Theresa May will face a battle within her own party - as well as with the energy suppliers - if she decides to go ahead with a cap on gas and electricity prices. A number of Tory MPs favouring free market policies, including some at senior ministerial level, feel the plan is far too interventionist for a Conservative government, and are aiming to water down the proposal in the next parliament. The MPs are not breaking cover with direct criticism during the election campaign, but some are openly pushing for a more “relative” cap – which would link standard tariffs to the cheapest deals by capping the differential between the highest and lowest price an energy company can charge. Speaking of Eurovision, as we were a bit earlier, don’t forget the first semi-final is on BBC4 live from Kiev right now. And if you want to know what the song contest means in today’s Europe, read this: Guardian reporter Ben Quinn adds: The twittersphere is agog with reaction to Philip May’s first broadcast interview appearance on the One Show. These tweets from the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope sum up rather nicely what he and Theresa May “revealed”: Both Philip and Theresa May agreed it was love at first sight when they were introduced at an Oxford University student disco by mutual friend Benazir Bhutto - who went on to become prime minister of Pakistan. Asked for his first impressions of the woman who would become his wife, Philip said: “What a lovely girl!” And he gallantly added: “And she still is.” Asked by presenter Alex Jones whether he “fancied her instantly”, Mr May replied: “Absolutely, it was love at first sight.” Mrs May chimed in: “Likewise.” Asked why there has been such a strong focus on her rather than the Conservative party in the campaign thus far, Theresa May manages to get not one but two mentions of her catchphrase in. This election is about having a “strong and stable government, strong and stable leadership”, she says. Philip May might have let a cat out of the bag: his wife had wanted to be prime minister since she was a member of the shadow cabinet. He also says Theresa had been keen to stand as a local councillor, which was the start of her political career. Theresa May says she had wanted to be an MP since her school days: “It’s always been about making a difference ... help people to get on and have a better future.” And now to the first segment proper of Theresa and Philip May’s appearance on the One Show. Presenters Matt Baker and Alex Jones begin by asking the PM about growing up a vicarage and what values that instilled in her. She says it taught her to “take people as you find them and treat everyone equally”, adding: “Life in a vicarage is different.” The prime minister also reveals that her parents encouraged her to “get on and do your best” whatever job she was doing. The first question to Philip is about his father’s career - he spent his whole career working for a footwear company, from the 1940s to his retirement in the 1980s. Theresa May tried a joke when she appeared on The One Show with her husband, Philip, in his first broadcast interview. Asked by presenter Alex Jones whether the UK was leaving the Eurovision song contest as well as the EU, the prime minister responded, after a brief pause, with a slightly surprised sounding “no”. She then added: “I’m not sure how many votes we’ll get.” As their election tour continues, John Harris and John Domokos watch the Labour party lose in Lancashire. Public services may have been ravaged by austerity, but the Conservatives appear to be on a roll. As children’s centres, libraries and buses are axed, even a passionate local anti-cuts campaigner cannot stop the blue surge. So what’s going on? Jeremy Corbyn has joined a busker for a rendition of Stand By Me after a marketplace rally in Greater Manchester. The Labour leader sang along as Dan Hetfield strummed on his Union Jack-patterned acoustic guitar in front of supporters in Ashton-under-Lyne. The crowd joined in and gave the pair a rousing reception after a stump speech in which Corbyn railed against his vision of “Tory Britain”, where public services are ravaged by cuts. He promised Labour would build a country “for the many, not the few”. The event followed Labour battle bus visits to Salford and Wythenshawe on the first official day of the party’s general election campaign. The Lib Dems have offered their two cents worth on Jeremy Corbyn’s refusal - seven times - to answer whether a bad Brexit deal could be rejected and thus let Britain stay in the EU. The party’s shadow foreign secretary, Tom Brake, says: “This is Corbyn’s Michael Howard moment, refusing repeatedly to answer a straight question. Labour is refusing to give people the final say no matter how bad the Brexit deal on offer. The Liberal Democrats’ position is clear: we think you should have the final say in a referendum, and if you don’t like the deal you should have the choice to remain in the European Union.” Jeremy Corbyn has accused the Conservatives of holding Britain back as he launched Labour’s general election campaign with a rousing speech to activists in Manchester. Labour has confirmed that the UK will leave the EU if it wins the election, after Corbyn repeatedly refused to give that assurance in a BBC interview. (See 3.44pm.) Corbyn has disowned a claim he made in an interview yesterday that he intended to stay on as Labour leader even if he lost the election. (See 4.21pm.) Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool, has effectively accused the party of cronyism after the party blocked him from being the Labour candidate for a safe Labour seat in the city and selected a far less prominent and less local assistant to the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, instead. (See 4.39pm.) Labour has expelled three senior members in Surrey for trying to unseat the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, by forming a progressive alliance with local Greens and Liberal Democrats to unite behind an NHS doctor standing against him. Theresa May has said she still believes in free markets despite pledging to cap energy prices, after it was pointed out her party had dismissed a similar plan put forward by Ed Miliband as “Marxist”. Miliband, the former Labour leader, has criticised the Tory version of his energy price cap plan. Speaking to ITV News, he said: I think the real thing is always better than the imitation. We’ve had year after year of rising bills under the Conservatives. Now they’ve come up with a policy which Theresa May admitted this afternoon can’t guarantee that energy bills won’t carry on rising. I’m afraid it’s a price con not a price cap ... If they were going to copy my idea, Theresa May should have done a much better job of it than she’s done because, looking at the detail and the fine print, they’re not guaranteeing that there won’t be a rise in prices as we did, they are saying somebody else has got to make that judgement. So she certainly can’t be promising money off bills or even actually that prices won’t carry on going up. May has refused to rule out increasing national insurance contributions if she wins the general election. (See 2.09pm.) May has said that she backs fox hunting and that she would give MPs a free vote on repealing the Hunting Act. (See 3.52pm.) Girls would be provided with free sanitary products in schools under a Liberal Democrat initiative that the party has said would end the hidden problem of “period poverty” – where teenagers miss school because they cannot afford pads or tampons. That’s all from me for today. My colleague Chris Johnston is now taking over. Dan Carden, whose father was a trade unionist who lost his jobs in the 1995 Liverpool dockers’ strike, said being selected for Liverpool Walton was “the proudest moment of my life”. (See 4.39pm.) “It’s the pinnacle of a journey I could not have dreamed of,” he said. When my dad first explained to me, when I was just eight years old, that he had been sacked for refusing to cross a picket line, this lit the flame in me that has fired my dedication to the service of working people. I am 30 years old, from a different generation with different experiences but I know that only Labour is on our side. I’m ambitious for what the Labour Party can do for our people, for this country as a whole. Only a Labour government will transform our economy, redistribute wealth fairly from the few to the many and give hope to communities like ours. Carden joined the Labour party when still at school and then went to work for Knowsley MP George Howarth after university, before working for the Unite leadership over the last five years. Unite had no comment, as the selection is a matter for the Labour party. Last night BuzzFeed published a lengthy interview with Jeremy Corbyn, carried out by its political editor, Jim Waterson. It was interesting, candid and relatively sympathetic. But it was headlined on Corbyn’s comment about staying on even if Labour lost the election and this has angered Corbyn’s team who have told BuzzFeed they will retaliate. It has written a story headlined: “BuzzFeed News Has Been Denied Access To Campaign Events After Our Interview With The Labour Leader.” Here is an extract. A BuzzFeed News reporter covering Labour’s campaign launch in Manchester on Tuesday was told she could not join the leader on campaign stops in the afternoon. An aide told her BuzzFeed News was not invited and implied it was as a result of the interview, which led on Corbyn’s comment that he would “stay leader of this party” regardless of the election results. Political editor Jim Waterson, who carried out the interview, then contacted Corbyn’s spokesperson to find out why we had not been invited to the campaign stops. A senior Corbyn aide told him that BuzzFeed News would now find its access limited because the interview had disrupted media coverage of Labour’s launch event, that we had not informed Corbyn’s team in advance of the headline we intended to run, and that we had press released the interview to other media organisations who then chose to pick it up. In his interview with the BBC Corbyn also denied telling BuzzFeed that he would stay on as leader even if Labour lost the election. (See 4.21pm.) But that is not correct. BuzzFeed has released audio and a transcript of the relevant part of the interview, and Corbyn was clearly responding to a question about what would happen if Labour lost. A political analyst, Prof James Mitchell, has challenged suggestions last week’s council elections has greatly boosted the chances of Scotland’s pro-UK parties, Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems, winning back large numbers of seats from the Scottish National party in June’s general election. Data on the votes cast in Thursday’s vote implied the SNP were performing far below their recent opinion polls ratings of about 44%, gaining just 32% of first0 preference votes against 25% for the Tories, 20% for Labour and 7% for the Lib Dems, under the single transferrable vote system used in council elections. With the pro-independence Scottish Greens winning just 4%, that implies the pro-UK vote in Scotland stands at a strong 52% against 36% for pro-independence parties. The Electoral Management Board Scotland data also showed far higher turnout in affluent councils - areas where the Tories in particular hope to beat the SNP on 8 June. Tory target seats East Renfrewshire had the highest turnout of 58% and Perth and Kinross 54%, with Lib Dem target seat East Dunbartonshire at 56%. In contrast, Glasgow - where the SNP is now the largest party - recorded the lowest turnout of 39%. Dundee, Scotland’s second “yes city” in the 2014 independence campaign, had a 42% turnout, also below the Scottish average of 47%. However, the Scottish council elections included 10.5% votes for independent, unaligned candidates who won 13.7% of the seats. Mitchell, professor of chair of public policy at Edinburgh university, said it was dangerous to assume first preference votes in council elections where candidates compete in multi-member wards were comparable to Westminster’s very different first past the post system. While the high turnout was interesting, council elections had to be treated carefully. Given the SNP won 32% of first preferences in 2012, last week’s 32% for the SNP “would suggest to me the opinion polls [for the SNP] are probably about right. This is a standstill result [but] they will lose seats on 8 June. The danger is that the Tories are over-hyping things at the moment.” Ben Williams, secretary of Liverpool Walton constituency Labour party, says he will resign over the decision to select Dan Carden as Labour’s candidate. (See 4.39pm.) He says it is a “disgraceful, undemocratic stitch-up”. Caroline Lucas, the Green party co-leader, has said her party will turn its back on “progressive alliances” after Labour expelled three members who backed a progressive candidate, the Press Association reports. Lucas said the Labour and Liberal Democrat stance has “betrayed the people they represent” by failing to properly consider electoral pacts between broadly left-wing parties. Her comments came after Labour members in South West Surrey were expelled for backing Louise Irvine, a GP who is standing for the National Health Action (NHA) party against health secretary Jeremy Hunt. Steve Williams, a former Labour parliamentary candidate and member of his local party’s executive committee, told the Press Association he was “very disappointed” to have been expelled for trying to unseat Hunt. Lucas said: “Labour and the Lib Dems defied their own members on the ground - and the time has now come for the Greens to focus entirely on winning votes up and down the country.” She said Labour refused to even meet with the Greens to discuss these alliances, while the Lib Dems were only willing to engage at arm’s length. “Having done what we can, our focus is now entirely on winning votes up and down the country - and sending more MPs to Parliament on June 8,” said Lucas. “The other parties have proved in recent weeks that they aren’t fit for the modern political age.” Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot’s story about the expulsion of the three Labour members backing the NHA party in South West Surrey. And here is a picture of the so-called “Godalming three”, posted by one of them. Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool, has put out a statement saying that the decision not to chose him as Labour’s candidate for Liverpool Walton shows the party “is not always a meritocracy”. Despite his record as Labour leader on the council, taking the party back to power, and as a twice-elected mayor, Labour chose Dan Carden, an aide to the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, instead. (See 3.32pm.) Liverpool Walton is Labour’s safest seat by one measure. Carden grew up in the city but, as the Liverpool Echo reports, is a relative unknown compared to Anderson, the leading figure in local government in the city. But Carden does work for McCluskey, Jeremy Corbyn’s most important ally in the union movement. Effectively Anderson is accusing the party of cronyism. Here is is statement. In his BBC interview with Laura Kuenssberg Jeremy Corbyn also stepped back from the suggestion in his BuzzFeed interview that he would stay on as Labour leader even if he lost the election. (See 9.47am.) Here is the key excerpt from the interview. LK: Your closest political colleague John McDonnell said it was inevitable that you and he would resign if you lose at a general election. Is he right. Would you resign? JC: We’re planning to win the general election so the question doesn’t arise. LK: Well the question arose … JC: The question doesn’t arise. LK: ... when John McDonnell said it and you told a different media outlet that you would stay on. JC: The question, the question doesn’t arise because we’re campaigning this election to win it. LK: You have told other media outlets that you would stay on if you lose. JC: No I told them I would carry on as leader because we’ll have won the election by then. LK: So you will carry on as leader even if you lose? JC: Listen, we’re in this campaign to win it. We’re in this campaign to get support for the policies that we’ve put forward and we’ve had a huge increase in party membership even since the election started and a massive numbers of people coming forward wanting to be part of our campaign. Corbyn claimed that in his interview with BuzzFeed (the “other media outlet”), when he talked about staying on as Labour leader, he was talking about in the event of Labour winning. But that is not how BuzzFeed reported it. (See 9.47am.) Sir Roger Gale, a Conservative party vice chairman and a patron of Conservatives Against Fox Hunting, said it was a mistake for his party to promise a free vote on the repeal of the Hunting Act. He told the Press Association: I cannot see many Conservative votes for fox hunting in marginal seats we are hoping to win ... We have more than enough to occupy parliamentary time with Brexit and all that follows. In my view, it’d be folly to waste further time on the issue. Labour’s plan extending free school meals to all primary pupils in England would cost £950m a year, but might not deliver the promised gains, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says in a short briefing today. Here’s an excerpt. Universal free school meals can improve attainment in some circumstances. A 2012 pilot study by IFS researchers and others found that Year 6 students in Newham and Durham, where all primary children were offered free school lunches, made around two months’ additional progress over a two-year period compared to similar children in other areas. In this observation we argue that extending the policy nationwide would come at a significant cost and might not lead to similar gains. Other policies, such as offering free breakfast clubs (as is the case in Wales and as trialled in England) might be a cheaper and more effective way to improve both education and health outcomes. Theresa May has confirmed that, if the Conservatives win the election, it will allow a free vote on lifting the ban on fox hunting. Speaking at the event earlier in West Yorkshire she said: This is a situation on which individuals will have one view or the other, either pro or against. As it happens personally I have always been in favour of fox hunting and we maintain out commitment - we have had a commitment previously as a Conservative party - to allow a free vote. And that’s what it will allow, would allow, parliament the opportunity to take a decision on this. Allowing a free vote has been Tory policy for some years but, even though the government has been Conservative-led or Conservative since 2010, hunting supporters have not pressed for a vote because there have not been enough pro-hunting MPs in the Commons for them to win. But a big Conservative victory next month could change that. Today’s Daily Mirror quotes Lord Mancroft, chairman of the Council of Hunting Associations, as saying that a majority of 50 or more would give them “a real opportunity” to repeal the Hunting Act. The Labour rebuttal unit has been in action again this afternoon - rebutting, or at least clarifying, what Jeremy Corbyn was saying earlier. If Labour wins the election, the UK will leave the EU, aides to the Labour leader say. This is not the first time aides have had to tidy up after a Corbyn interview. Last month the party had to confirm that Labour was committed to renewing Trident after Corbyn gave an interview to Andrew Marr that suggested there might be a possibility of a rethink. Tim Farron had continued in the fine but niche tradition of Lib Dem leaders climbing aboard hovercrafts on the campaign trail, taking the orange vessel for a spin in Burnham-on-Sea. Farron and Wells candidate Tessa Munt made a series of u-turns on the beach, though avoided taking the hovercraft out to sea. The vessel was captained by volunteers from BARB, the local search and rescue operation. “We’re leaving the EU, so no health and safety,” Farron joked as he climbed into the hovercraft. Farron is the latest of a number of Liberal leaders to use the transport as an election stunt. The former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe lead a rather more ambitious hovercraft expedition in 1974, touring the southwest coast on a hovercraft and disembarking to canvass the then-liberal heartlands. Nick Clegg also took a turn in the Burnham-on-Sea hovercraft in 2008, before his rather more prominent about-turn in coalition as deputy prime minister. Dan Carden, an aide to the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, has been selected as Labour’s candidate in Liverpool Walton. There will be a row about this because, as Rowena Mason wrote earlier (see 3.24pm), activists in the constituencies wanted someone more local. Tory HQ is furious about Michael Crick’s tweets. (See 2.31pm.) One senior source said the party does decide in advance which news organisations will get to ask questions, but that it only does this to ensure that questions are shared around fairly between different papers. Newspapers that get left out one day are included another day, the source. But what CCHQ is really angry about is the suggestion in one Crick tweet that reporters get banned from asking questions if they don’t declare in advance what they are going to ask. A senior figure said that the party doesn’t, and wouldn’t, do this. Colleagues who spend more time at these events than I do also say the Crick story does not fit with their experience. Crick quotes an unnamed reporter who told him otherwise. Press officers do sometimes ask what topics reporters intend to raise, and so perhaps there was a misunderstanding. Alternatively, there may have been an over-zealous aide on one occasion going beyond the wishes of CCHQ. Labour is facing a local revolt in Liverpool over the shortlisting of an aide to Unite general secretary Len McCluskey for one of the party’s safest seats vacated by the city region’s new mayor, Steve Rotheram. Dan Carden, who works for McCluskey, is one on a shortlist of three Labour candidates, which also includes Joe Anderson, Liverpool’s longstanding local council chief, and Theresa Griffin, a northwest MEP who was a local councillor in the city. Carden grew up in Liverpool but senior figures in Liverpool Labour politics have mounted an attempt to stop him winning the seat, as the party’s national executive committee (NEC) meets to interview candidates on Tuesday afternoon. The Guardian understands a group of dozens of local Liverpool councillors and local members have written to the NEC ahead of the selection, demanding that someone with a “proven track record of representing the people in our area” is selected for the seat “Liverpool Walton is one of the safest Labour seats in the Country but we must never take a single vote for granted,” wrote the members, who include Ben Williams, secretary of Liverpool Walton’s constituency Labour party. “Local residents deserve to be represented by a member of our community rather than by someone imposed... The extraordinary situation of the snap general election means that the NEC has been forced to move quickly to select Labour candidates. However this doesn’t mean local concerns should be sidelined.” Here is the relevant passage from the BBC transcript in full where Jeremy Corbyn repeatedly refused to say if the UK was certain to leave the EU if Labour won the election. Corbyn (JC) was being interviewed by Laura Kuenssberg (LK). LK: Jeremy Corbyn let’s start with Brexit because if you become prime minister it will be the biggest task in front of you. You said today Brexit is settled. Does that mean if you’re prime minister, come hell or high water, whatever the deal on the table, we will be leaving the European Union? JC: Look there’s a clear vote in the referendum a year ago. But there is now the negotiations which have already begun. I sent a letter to President Elect Macron last night congratulating him on his election and also setting out in broad terms what our aims are in these negotiations: To have good relations with Europe of course, secondly to make sure there is a trade access, a tariff free trade access, to European markets. Thirdly, that we will of course protect the rights of EU nationals living in Britain which we will do straight away and that we will also ensure that the regulations that we got from the European Union such as Working Time Directive and employment conditions will be defended and maintained. It has to be put very clearly. LK: That is what you would hope to achieve. But on that specific point if you say Brexit is settled whatever happens in the negotiations - however well or badly they go - we would be leaving if you were prime minister. JC: We will go into the negotiations with the determination to achieve what I’ve just outlined. And it’s not a one-off meeting, it’s not a one-off discussion. It also involves relations with all the governments across Europe in every one of the member states as well as their parliaments and the European governments and the commission. LK: But forgive me Jeremy Corbyn that’s not quite my question. My question is if you’re prime minister we will leave come hell or high water whatever is on the table at the end of the negotiations? JC: We win the election we’ll get the good deal with Europe. A good deal with Europe that will ensure that the very large number of manufacturing jobs in Britain that rely on trade with Europe won’t suddenly find themselves under World Trade Organization rules where there’ll be a tariff wall put up immediately around this country. LK: But on that specific point Jeremy Corbyn few few can predict how the negotiations will go either for Theresa May... JC: The specific point is we’re negotiating to gain that market access to Europe. LK: But you won’t say then that we might potentially stay or we might... just to be completely clear because people will want to know this. If you’re prime minister we will leave whatever happens? JC: People know that there’s been a referendum and a decision was made a year ago. We’ve set out very clear our terms for negotiations. Keir Starmer has built those relationships across Europe and that is what we’ll be pursuing in the European Union. I don’t know any more than you do exactly what is going to happen in the future on this, but I do know we are not approaching this from megaphone diplomacy. We’re not approaching this from threats. We’re not proposing to set up some kind of tax haven on the shores of the European Union. We’re serious about these negotiations. LK: But forgive me Jeremy Corbyn this is a very important point to lots of people. As you say, we don’t know what will happen in the negotiations. If you are prime minister can you categorically say that we would definitely leave because if you won’t there is a chink of a possibility that things could change and we might end up looking differently at our options. JC: The danger is of the approach the Conservatives are taking in their megaphone diplomacy with Europe and approaching the whole thing as though what you’ve got to do is shout loud and be abusive to people across the Channel. Our view is you have to talk to them, negotiate with them and recognise there is actually quite a lot of common interest, particularly in manufacturing industry. That is the process we’re following. LK: So you won’t you won’t address that point specifically? JC: We are negotiating a trade arrangement with Europe and protection of the things that we’ve gained from the European Union. The Telegraph’s Steven Swinford says the BBC transcript shows Jeremy Corbyn refusing seven times to confirm that the UK will definitely leave the EU if Labour wins. (See 2.36pm.) The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, who conducted the interview, says she asked the question five times. Just to make things confusing, by my count Kuenssberg put the question six times. Whatever, Corbyn was repeatedly asked to confirm that the UK would definitely leave the EU if Labour won the election, and did not once answer with a clear yes. The BBC has just released the transcript of an interview that Jeremy Corbyn gave to Laura Kuenssberg. Here is one of the highlights. I will post a full summary soon. Q: You said we will leave the EU. Will EU nationals be allowed to stay afterwards? May thanks EU workers here for their contribution. And she says she hopes to reach an early agreement guaranteeing that EU nationals can stay in the UK after Brexit, and that Britons in other EU countries can stay too. Theresa May is now doing a Q&amp;A with workers at a factory in West Yorkshire. Presumably employees won’t be subject to the same rules that apply to journalists, as described by Channel 4 News’ Michael Crick. UPDATE: Tory HQ is furious about Michael Crick’s tweets. One senior source said the party does decide in advance which news organisations will get to ask questions, but that it only does this to ensure that questions are shared around fairly between different papers. Newspapers that get left out one day are included another day, the source. But what CCHQ is really angry about is the suggestion in one Crick tweet that reporters get banned from asking questions if they don’t declare in advance what they are going to ask. A senior figure said that the party doesn’t, and wouldn’t, do this. Colleagues who spend more time at these events than I do also say the Crick story does not fit with their experience. Crick quotes an unnamed reporter who told him otherwise. Press officers do sometimes ask what topics reporters intend to raise, and so perhaps there was a misunderstanding. Alternatively, there may have been an over-zealous aide on one occasion going beyond the wishes of CCHQ. Jeremy Corbyn has suggested he would oppose sending fresh British troops to Afghanistan, as Nato has requested, telling journalists it would not help to resolve the conflict. Speaking after he launched Labour’s general election campaign bus, Corbyn said: I want to see a peace settlement in Afghanistan, I was opposed to the deployment of troops in the first place in Afghanistan, I think we have to look at promoting political stability in Afghanistan, and we will look at that request when it comes. Asked if British troops had undermined stability in Afghanistan, he said: I think British troops have suffered a great deal in Afghanistan and I’ve spoken to many troops who have been through awful, awful situations there, and they want to see a secure political solution in Afghanistan. At the end of the day, wars are not solved by the presence of foreign troops, they’re solved by political solutions, that’s what I believe. The Labour leader refused to reopen the question of whether he will step down, if the party loses the general election. On Monday, Corbyn said he would be “carrying on” but asked about it again, he said: I think we’ll win this election: that’s the only question. An aide then said: “Moving on...”. Corbyn also dismissed the idea that Labour-supporting voters should vote tactically for other parties, including the LibDems and the Greens, in a so-called “progressive alliance” to limit the size of the Tory majority. He said: We’re a party that covers the whole country, and I want people all over the country to have the chance to vote Labour, which they’ve got. There are Labour candidates all over the country, and I want people to vote Labour, for the policies we’ll bring forward, which will change this country, which will produce more opportunity, more equality wherever you are. So vote Labour wherever you are. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said that Theresa May’s comments about national insurance (see 1.41pm) suggest the Tories will put up national insurance if they win the election. In a statement he said: Theresa May has once again failed to rule out more national insurance contribution increases. There is already a £2bn black hole in the Budget from when the Tories tried to sneak through a hike in NICs only a month ago, and it is becoming clear they are looking to try to go ahead with this tax hike if they’re re-elected next month. The Tories still won’t rule out further tax rises on those with low and middle incomes and are a threat to working people. Labour’s personal tax guarantee rules out rises in national insurance contributions, VAT and income taxes for the 95%. Labour is now the party of low taxes for the many and not the few. Jeremy Corbyn did not take questions immediately after his speech, although he did do a round of broadcast interviews and, I gather, is speaking to print journalists too. Theresa May did take questions after her stump speech this morning, although, given the thoroughness and accuracy of some of her replies, that might not have been a big bonus. Here are the key points. May refused to rule out increasing national insurance contributions (NICs). Asked specifically if she would match Labour, which has promised not to raise employee NICs, she said that it was not her intention to put up tax but that she would not make commitments she could not be sure of keeping. She said: It is not our intention to increase the level of tax but I’m not going to make any tax commitments that we are not absolutely sure we can keep. But our instinct is to reduce taxes on working families. She said the Conservatives always had been and always would be a low tax party. In contrast, she claimed that in the past Jeremy Corbyn talked about raising the basic rate of tax to 25p in the pound. (At this election Labour has committed to not raising income tax for anyone on less than £80,000.) She rejected claims that her support for an energy price cap meant she was living in a “Marxist universe”. That was what David Cameron said about Ed Miliband when he proposed the idea. Asked if she was living in a “Marxist universe”, she replied: No. First of all, we are Conservatives. We believe in free markets and competition, but we want to see competition working. She falsely claimed that her proposal was different from Miliband’s, claiming Miliband was proposing a price freeze that would have stopped prices going up or down. When it was put to her that her plan was the same as Labour’s in 2015, she replied: You are wrong. Ed Miliband didn’t suggest a cap on energy prices. Ed Miliband suggested a freeze on energy prices that would have frozen them so people paying above the odds would have continued to pay above the odds and, crucially, the prices could not have gone down. Under our cap, prices will be able to go down. But it is May who is wrong. The Labour 2015 manifesto (pdf) said: Labour will freeze energy bills until 2017, ensuring that bills can fall but not rise ... See 8.34am for more details. She refused to confirm that energy bills would definitely go down under her plan. She implied they would, but could not be definite. Asked about this, she said: What we are talking about is a cap on energy prices that will be set by an independent regulator and that will be a reflection of the market. Crucially it will be possible for that cap to move. But the independent regulator will set it. But the key thing is that people are clearly paying too much for their energy bills today. She refused to say whether or not some cabinet ministers were opposed to the plan to impose a cap on energy prices. Here is some more comment on the Corbyn speech from journalists. From ITV’s Daniel Hewitt From the Manchester Evening News’ Jennifer Williams From the Times’ Sam Coates From the Mail’s James Tapsfield Q: Will you join a campaign against fake news? May says we all want to see accurate reporting. A lot of people put a lot of faith in local papers, she says. She says a free press is one of the important pillars of our democracy. And that’s it. I will post a summary soon. Q: Labour says it won’t raise national insurance. Can you give that assurance? And what is your message for high earner? May says the Conservatives believe in low taxes. But she will only make promises she can keep. She says Labour’s instinct is always to raise taxes. She says Corbyn has talked in the past about raising income tax to 25p. May refuses to commit to not increasing national insurance. Q: Did anyone in your cabinet oppose the energy cap? And are you guaranteeing that prices will go down? May says the CMA said customers were paying £1.4bn more than they would have done if the energy market were truly competitive. The cap will be reflective of the market. It will be set by the regulator and it will move. But the crucial thing is that people are paying too much now. (May dodges both the questions that were asked.) Q: David Cameron said Ed Miliband was living in an Marxist universe when he proposed this. Are you living in a Marxist universe? May says Miliband was proposing a freeze. Prices would not have been able to go down. Under the Tory plan prices will be able to go down. (May is just wrong about this - see 8.34am.) May repeats the point that she made yesterday about why Emmanuel Macron winning a big majority boosts the need for her to get a big mandate. (It is a rather tenuous point - see here.) She also repeats the line she used yesterday asking people to imagine Jeremy Corbyn conducting the Brexit negotiations. And, just as she did yesterday, she urges candidates to work flat out for a Conservative victory. Theresa May is speaking at an election event in York. My colleague Frances Perraudin is there. That may have been Jeremy Corbyn’s best speech as Labour leader. It did not feel as if it was transformative - in fact, it contained almost nothing that counts as hard news (a statement of something we didn’t know) - but it made the case for change and for social justice with a measure of clarity and simplicity (and brevity) that previous speeches have lacked. It was full-on socialist populism, depicting Britain as a country, where politics and the economy are “rigged” in the interests of the few and where the election provides Labour with an opportunity to bring about a moment of “reckoning” for the “tax cheats, rip off bosses, greedy bankers” and other assorted villains of neo-liberalism. Conventionally elections are fought by appealing to the supposed “middle ground”. And perhaps there are enough people in Britain who share Corbyn’s outrage at injustice and inequality (notice how in the speech “Monsieur Zen” [see 9.47am] became Mr Angry [see 11.40am]). But last week’s local election results suggest otherwise, and it was hard to see what was in the speech to make those people who are already sceptical about Corbyn’s Labour think again. But Labour supporters will love it. The speech was almost entirely focused on domestic issues (he did not mention defence or foreign policy, which are the areas where he had serious policy differences with mainstream Labour MPs) and it was a speech around which the party can unite. It will be seen as one intended to shore up the “core vote”, probably with a view not just to what happens on 8 June, but to what happens afterwards. Here is the passage from Jeremy Corbyn’s speech where he talked about how the Sunday Times rich list showed that Britain’s richest people have seen their wealth rise by 14% in the last year. But Britain is a rich country – the sixth richest in the world. We caught a glimpse of that wealth only two days ago when Rupert Murdoch’s Sunday Times published its Rich List. In the last year, Britain’s 1,000 richest people have seen their wealth rise by 14 per cent to £658 billion – that’s nearly six times the budget of our NHS. Imagine the outcry if public sector workers put in for a 14 per cent pay rise. But it’s no surprise that the richest have got even richer after the tens of billions the Tories have handed them in tax cuts. That’s what we mean when we say the system is rigged for the rich. So thanks for making that clear, Mr Murdoch – though I imagine it’s the only help you will give us in this campaign. The event has now wrapped up. Jeremy Corbyn did not take questions. I will post a summary shortly. The shadow cabinet are now joining Jeremy Corbyn on stage as the applause continues. Corbyn is now on his peroration. Don’t wake on up on 9 June to see celebrations from the tax cheats, the press barons, the greedy bankers, Philip Green, the Southern Rail directors and crooked financiers that take our wealth, who have got away with it because the party they own, the Conservative Party, has won. We have four weeks to ruin their party. We have four weeks to have a chance to take our wealth back. We have four weeks to show what kind of country we are. We know that the people of Britain don’t pass by on the other side. That is the principle we will take into government so that we can unlock every person’s potential and everyone can make their best contribution to our society. We have four weeks to win and transform Britain for the many not the few. We must seize that chance. Thank you. Corbyn says Labour wants to transform Britain for the many, not the few. When we win, the British people win. The nurse, the teacher, the small trader, the carer, the builder, the office worker win. Labour is offering a real choice, a real alternative to the rigged system holding us back and to the Conservatives who are running our country down. The economy is still rigged in favour of the rich and powerful. And he says there will be a “reckoning” for those who have exploited the system when Labour wins. When Labour wins there will be a reckoning for those who thought they could get away with asset stripping our industry, crashing our economy through their greed and ripping off workers and consumers. When did the Conservatives – David Cameron, George Osborne, Theresa May, Boris Johnson - ever stand up to their financial backers and demand our money back? Never and they never will. Instead, they make others foot the bill – they make our nurses, our carers, our soldiers, our disabled, our young people trying to get a home of their own, our elderly looking for dignity in retirement and those working hard to get on, foot the bill. It makes me angry. And I know it makes the people of Britain angry too. So today, I say to tax cheats, the rip off bosses, the greedy bankers; enough is enough. In this election, Labour is standing for decent jobs, investment for the future, shared wealth creation, security at work, affordable homes for all, a fully funded NHS and schools, training and skills, an end to rip-off privatisation, fair taxation and a fairer, more equal country. This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. Corbyn uses the line briefed in advance about how the election is not about Brexit and about how “that issue has been settled”. And he turns to Labour’s plan. Labour’s plan to transform Britain will mean: A big deal to upgrade the economy: new infrastructure to support the industries of the future. And an investment in training and skills to equip our workforce to compete globally. It means rebuilding our NHS and social care services with the funding they need. It means building a million homes to rent and buy. And it means tackling the scandal of air pollution which contributes to 40,000 deaths per year. We won’t be paying lip-service to working people. We will introduce a comprehensive programme to strengthen rights at work, make sure new jobs are good jobs, and end the race to the bottom in pay, conditions and job security. Low pay and insecurity have spread like an epidemic under the Tories. Labour will invest in skills and jobs, and take action to enforce a floor under employment standards across the board – so that all jobs are decent jobs, so that all workers – the true wealth creators - can play their part in transforming Britain and benefit fully from it. Corbyn says Theresa May claims to be on the side of working people. But does she think people will forget how the Tories have actually treated working people? It was this Tory leader who sat alongside David Cameron in government for six years. She was with him when they introduced the bedroom tax. What’s remotely fair about the bedroom tax? What was fair about racking up tuition fees? Or about taking benefits away from people with disabilities? Or about closing Sure Start Centres. Or starving schools of cash. Or opening up the NHS to be feasted on by profiteers. (I am using the text released by Labour. Corbyn is making some minor additions as he goes on, but he is not diverging from the text on substance.) Corbyn says Labour is under attack because it is drawing a line under “three decades of privatisation”. Our Westminster system is broken and our economy is rigged. Both are run in the interests of the few. Labour is under attack because we are standing up to the elites who are determined to hijack Brexit to pay even less tax and take even more of the wealth we all create. Labour is under attack because we are standing up to the corporate interests plundering our NHS. How much more will be privatised if the Tories get another five years? We’re drawing a line. Three decades of privatisation – from energy and rail to health and social care – has made some people very rich but it has not delivered richer lives for the majority. Corbyn says he is not expecting Murdoch to give Labour any more help during the election. Change always provokes opposition, he says. Change always involves taking on vested interests. And there is a real danger that the Tories’ fearmongering and spin machine will make some people settle for less than they should. Resign themselves to things the way they are - underestimating just how many more burdens the Tories could impose if their mission to rig the system for the rich isn’t halted. He says people are being held back, like families who cannot get their children into decent schools, or people who cannot afford to buy a home, or people who cannot pursue their retirement dreams because they are supporting adult children. He says the Sunday Times rich list on Sunday showed the 1,000 richest people saw their wealth rise by 14% over the last year. Imagine the outcry if public sector workers applied for a 14% pay rise. But it is no surprise. The Tories have given tax cuts to rich. That is what people mean when they say the system is rigged. So thanks, Rupert Murdoch, for making that plain, he says. Corbyn says it is fantastic to be launching the campaign in Manchester. Manchester shows the way in many things, as it did when it elected Andy Burnham as mayor. Burnham takes the stage and joins Corbyn briefly. Think how much more Burnham could achieve with a Labour government, he says. Corbyn says Britain can be transformed. It does not have to be like this. He is now using some of the material briefed earlier. See 10.56am. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. Or trying to - but the applause is going on too long. The actress Julie Hesmondhalgh, from Coronation Street and Broadchurch, is speaking now. She says she had never felt as excited about politics as she did when Jeremy Corbyn became leader. She says Labour politics were finally in tune with her deeply held socialist beliefs. She says Labour has 30 days to turn things around. People think politicians are all the same. But they emphatically are not, she says. We have 30 days to create a fairer society and 30 days to save the NHS, she says. Let’s turn this mass movement “into a society that truly gives a toss about stuff”, she says. She says Corbyn has dedicated his life to giving a toss about other people. Lavery says Labour will experience setbacks. But it has to get back up, dust itself down, and carry on with the fight. The Labour and trade union movement was born in a struggle. They don’t call it a struggle for nothing, he says. Things can be different. No one has to be held back. He says they have a moral duty to communicate their message and policies to every town and village in the UK. Let’s organise, he concludes. “Onwards and upwards.” Lavery says it is 2017. This poverty cannot continue. Labour will stand for it no more. It does not have to be like this, he says. The Labour manifesto is bold and distinct, he says. It seeks to protect young people, for example by extending free school meals and brining back the educational maintenance allowance. And there are policies for old people too, he says, including on tackling the epidemic of loneliness. And for working people, Labour would introduce a proper living wage. He says on the BBC last week Theresa May was asked if it was fair that nurses, who have had a 14% pay cut, are having to use food banks. She said the reasons for this are complex. But it is not complex, he says. It is because they don’t have enough money. Lavery says Labour’s aim is not complex. It is about serving the many not the few, about transforming society, about making people’s lives better. We cannot continue down the well-trodden Tory path, he says, where a few at the top take all the gains. An election is about the future of the many not the few. We are the sixth richest economy in the world, he says. He will not stand for anyone saying we don’t have the finances to look after those at the bottom. In the last year the top 1,000 richest people got richer by £83bn, while 1m people use food banks. He won’t take lectures on wealth, he says. He mentions in a photograph in the Daily Mirror showing a child in hospital lying on two chairs pushed together. We have seen schools under attack, he says. Yet the prime minister is pursuing a wasteful grammar schools programme. He says Labour will ban zero-hours contracts. The Labour event is starting now. Ian Lavery, the joint Labour election chair, welcomes people to the event. Manchester is a wonderful city, he says. He says he is terribly excited about the election and about the party’s policies. He was a coal miner in the north east. It was a fantastic job, he says. And is proud to be the party’s joint election coordinator. My colleague Heather Stewart is at the Labour event. She has posted a picture on Twitter of the Labour battlebus. Here is the extract from Jeremy Corbyn’s speech at the event released in advance. We have four weeks to take our message to voters to convince them Britain can be better. It can be transformed. We can transform Britain into a country that - instead of being run for the rich - is a one where everyone can lead richer lives. And I mean richer in every sense. Richer because all of us have potential to fulfil, family to support, interests to pursue, richer when that potential is not held back. Labour will not allow the Tories to put their party interests ahead of the real national interest, the interests of the British people. This election isn’t about Brexit itself. That issue has been settled. The question now is what sort of Brexit do we want – and what sort of country do we want Britain to be after Brexit? Labour wants a jobs-first Brexit, a Brexit that safeguards the future of Britain’s vital industries, a Brexit that paves the way to a genuinely fairer society and an upgraded economy. When Labour wins, the British people win. The nurse, the teacher, the small trader, the carer, the builder, the office worker win. Labour is offering a real choice, a real alternative to the rigged system holding us back and to the Conservatives who are running our country down. The economy is rigged in favour of the rich and powerful. When Labour wins there will be a reckoning for those who thought they could get away with asset stripping our industry, crashing our economy through their greed and ripping off workers and consumers. Don’t wake on up on 9 June to see celebrations from the tax cheats, the press barons, the greedy bankers, Philip Green, the Southern Rail directors and crooked financiers that take our wealth, who have got away with it because the party they own, the Conservative party, has won. We have four weeks to ruin their party. We have four weeks to take our wealth back. We have four weeks to win and transform Britain for the many not the few. The Labour general election campaign launch starts at 11am. It is in Manchester, and Jeremy Corbyn is speaking. (Not to be confused with the manifesto launch, which is expected next week.) One of the ironies generated by Theresa May’s decision to pinch Ed Miliband’s energy price cap plan is that the Lib Dems now appear to be the only main party still defending the David Cameron stance on this policy (although, obviously, they don’t put it quite like that.) Here’s Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, commenting on the May plan this morning. Let’s remember what this will mean, the reality is energy prices will go up before this happens, it will mean bad news for the small providers. The way to get energy prices down is to invest in widening the markets, so you have to get more small players, more competition. That was working, and it is the Conservative decisions in the last couple of years to undermine those small energy providers which has made prices go through the roof. This is just a short-term gimmick and nobody believes it. More than a million applications to register to vote have been made since Theresa May called the general election, the Press Association reports. A total of 1,038,877 applications have been submitted since April 18, almost a third of them from people aged under 25. Applications from those aged 25 to 34 make up another third. By contrast, just 1% have come from people aged over 75. The figures do not necessarily mean one million new voters will be able to take part in the general election, however. Applicants typically include people checking to see if they are already registered to vote, as well as those who are ineligible. During the 2015 general election around five million applications to register to vote were made in England and Wales between January 1 and the deadline on April 20 - but the number registered to vote increased by only 1.4m. The debate about whether or not Jeremy Corbyn will, or should, resign if he loses the election is, at this point, still hypothetical. It is attracting considerable interest in Labour circles, where there is an assumption that Corbyn would be strongly urged to stay on by his leftwing allies, not least because they hope to get conference to pass a rule change in September which would increase the chances of another leftwinger winning the next leadership contest. But there is a peculiar bluntness and brutality about an election defeat that can make anything said in advance by a leader about staying on if they lose irrelevant. Alex Salmond in 2014 and David Cameron in 2016 provide good examples. It is also the case that having family saying it’s time to end the humiliation (something that applied to Ed Miliband in 2015) can be a factor not anticipated in advance. Everything will depend on what the landscape looks like on the morning of Friday 9 June. And, of course, it is possible that Labour could be better than expected. For what it’s worth, we do know what Labour members said about this when they were asked in March. YouGov conducted a survey of Labour members and, when asked if Corbyn should stay as leader if Labour lost the election, they replied: Continue as leader: 20% Not continue as leader: 68% Don’t know: 12% Even among people who joined the party after Corbyn became leader, 56% said he should stand down if he lost the election. Amongst people who joined before Corbyn became leader, the figure was 87%. And even amongst members who voted for Corbyn in the 2016 leadership contest, 50% said he should stand down if Labour lost. The full poll results are here (pdf). Energy UK, the trade body that represents energy companies, has criticised the Tory plan to cap energy bills. This is from its chief executive, Lawrence Slade. Today’s announcement effectively risks giving up on competition at a time when we need engaged consumers more than ever. Change is happening at a rapid pace in the energy sector, with ever-increasing levels of engagement, more choice and improving customer service. Further intervention risks undermining so many of the positive changes we are seeing in the market which are delivering benefits for consumers ... The solution is not to distort the market as a whole but see through the market reforms, allow competition to drive innovation and benefits for customers, while ensuring that there is targeted support for those most in need. In his Today interview Greg Clark, the business secretary, was unable to say that the Conservative energy price cap would definitely lead to prices going down. (See 8.19am.) That has prompted this tweet from Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader. Here is my colleague Matthew Weaver’s write-up of the Clark interview. Here is the BuzzFeed interview where Jeremy Corbyn said he would not resign even if Labour lost the election. Here is the key quote. Jeremy Corbyn is enjoying his first general election as Labour leader, and he wants to make something very clear: He intends to remain in the job, even if he isn’t victorious in next month’s vote. “I was elected leader of this party and I’ll stay leader of this party,” Corbyn told BuzzFeed News, taking a few minutes out from campaigning in the Warwickshire town of Leamington Spa. No matter what happens on 8 June, he said, he would be “carrying on”. And he insisted that the constant criticism and poor poll ratings were not getting to him. “Monsieur Zen is fine,” he said. “Monsieur Zen” is a name Corbyn first called himself in public last week. Labour sources have dismissed talk of what Corbyn might do after the election as a “distraction”, saying they are fully focused on the campaign. But Corbyn’s comment is generating quite a bit of interest on social media. Here are some of the more interesting Twitter responses. From James Morris, a former Labour pollster From the vicar and Guardian columnist Giles Fraser From the journalist and Guardian contributor Joan Smith From Adrian McMenamin, a former Labour staffer From BuzzFeed’s Stuart Millar From Novara Media’s Aaron Bastani From the New Statesman’s George Eaton (According to the Guido Fawkes website, Corbyn’s allies have been citing Neil Kinnock in 1987 and James Callaghan in 1979 as precedents for Labour leaders staying on after an election defeat, arguing Corbyn could do the same.) From the Conservative Michael Fabricant Labour has come under criticism for selecting a veteran MP to fight Rochdale in the general election rather than a new face, with one 2015 general election candidate describing the choice as “poor”. Tony Lloyd, 67, who served as MP for Stretford from 1983 to 1997 and then MP for Manchester Central until 2012 when he became Greater Manchester’s police and crime commissioner, has been chosen over less experienced candidates, with Labour fearful that the incumbent, Simon Danczuk, will stand as an Independent. Manchester Labour councillor Amina Lone, who lost Morecambe and Lunesdale in 2015 and was recently on the shortlist to contest the Manchester Gorton byelection, tweeted the Labour party: “Very poor decision. Are you incapable of nurturing/supporting new talent. No wonder people have little faith in politics.” Danczuk, who was barred from standing for Labour after a sexting scandal, will decide in the next day or two whether to fight Lloyd, turning Rochdale into a five-way marginal between him, Labour, the Conservatives, Ukip and the Lib Dems. Lloyd lost his job on Friday when Andy Burnham was elected mayor of Greater Manchester. Under the terms of the region’s devolution deal, the new metro mayor takes on responsibilities of the police and crime commissioner. The CBI has criticised the Conservatives’ energy price cap plan. This is from its deputy director general, Josh Hardie. He said: Putting customers at the heart of the energy market is important for everyone. The Competition and Markets Authority’s thorough two-year investigation identified low levels of consumers switching energy providers as a challenge, and put forward a range of recommendations to address this. It is important that these measures bed in before looking to further interventions. A major market intervention, such as a price cap, could lead to unintended consequences, for example dampening consumers’ desire to find the best deal on the market and hitting investor confidence. Theresa May has written an article for the Sun explaining her proposal for a price cap on energy bills. Here is an extract. It is clear to me that the energy market is not working for ordinary working families. Too many people simply aren’t getting a fair deal. I want to pay tribute to the Sun’s tireless campaigning on this issue. So I am making this promise: if I am re-elected on June 8, I will take action to end this injustice by introducing a cap on unfair energy price rises. It will protect around 17 million families on standard variable tariffs from being exploited with sudden and unjustified increases in bills. The cap will be set by the energy watchdog Ofgem and will help close the gap between standard tariffs and the cheapest deals. I expect it to save families on poor value tariffs as much as £100. It is part of my determination to stand up for Sun readers and build a country that works for everyone, not just the privileged few. Voting to leave the EU has put an additional 5p on a litre of petrol, the Liberal Democrats have claimed. Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister and now the party’s spokesman on Europe, said motorists were paying the price for the post-referendum slump in the value of the pound. The Lib Dems said that the average price of a litre of petrol has risen by 7p since the Brexit vote last June. Of that, 2p was due to the increase in the international oil price, with the rest down to the fall in sterling which followed the referendum, the Lib Dems said. They said the 5p Brexit price rise worked out at £2.50 on a tank of petrol for an average-sized car, or £60 per year for the average motorist. Clegg said: Theresa May claims that Brexit is going to be a great success. The reality is it’s going to make us poorer. The effects are already being felt. The rise in fuel costs will push up prices in the shops. This means consumers are going to be hit twice, once at the pump and again at the checkout. Claire has posted an extract from the Labour manifesto in 2015 which makes it clear that Ed Miliband was proposing an energy price cap that would allow bills to fall but not to rise. Greg Clark implied this morning that the Labour plan would not allow prices to fall. (See 8.19am.) Two weeks ago Sir Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, explicitly said prices would not be able to fall under Labour’s freeze. Miliband accused him of talking “garbage”. Q: When did you lose your faith in free markets? Clark says ensuring that markets cannot exploit customers is entirely in keeping with the Conservative tradition. And that’s it. Q: Businesses are opposed to getting net migration below 100,000. What do you say to them? Clark says the government does not want to stop net migration. The key point is that the UK will have control. It will design a policy that ensures businesses still have access to labour. Q: So where are you going to get your reduction from? Clark says it will come from the UK being able to set its own policy. Q: But where will you find the reductions? Who is coming that won’t be able to come in future? Clark says the UK needs to develop skills in this country. Nuclear power is expanding. At the moment skilled workers are being imported. Part of the Hinkley investment involves building a college to develop these skills. Q: Will you aim to meet this target in the five years of a parliament? Clark says the details will be in the manifesto. Clark refuses to confirm that the Tories will commit to getting annual net migration below 100,000 within five years. Theresa May also refused to give this commitment yesterday. Clark says, when the government knows some of the most vulnerable people are being charged £1.4bn more than they should, the government has to act. Q: The big firms have already put their prices up in anticipation of this. So people are paying a price for it already. Clark says some people actively switch providers. In that market, there is vigorous competition. But he says, amongst those people who do not switch, the firms exercise “market power”. Q: Your idea is the same as Labour’s, isn’t it? We were told this would lead to less investment, and prices going up. Those things will happen under your plan. Clark says Labour’s policy was crude. It was for a freeze. And politicians would have set the level. He says the Tory policy is based on the findings of a CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) investigation. Q: But you have gone beyond what the CMA proposed. They just called for a cap for people on pre-payment meters. Clark says the CMA was in two minds about whether to extend this to other consumers. A minority report said it should. Q: Can you guarantee that prices will go down. Clark says that will depend on what is happening to wholesale prices. He says the energy regulator would decide the cap. Q: Does the energy regulator have this power? Clark says the Tories would legislate to give the regulator this power. Good morning. I’m taking over from Claire. Greg Clark, the business secretary, is being interviewed on Today. Justin Webb is interviewing him. He starts by playing a clip of David Cameron accusing Ed Miliband of wanting to live in a “Marxist universe” when he proposed something similar. Q: What is your plan? Clark says the government is proposing a cap on default tariffs. Q: That would affect 17m, saving them £100m a year? Clark says overcharging has been estimated as costing consumers £1.4bn a year. He says the Competition and Markets Authority has said there is a lack of competition in the industry. So this cap could put firms under pressure to compete more effectively. Andrew Sparrow is picking up the live blog reins now. To sign up for the Snap, our daily election briefing email, pop over here for a moment. LBC has just announced that it’ll be hosting a radio phone-in with the PM on Thursday evening – billing it as “the first broadcast interview with Theresa May in which voters can ask the questions”. May has been repeatedly accused of dodging interactions with the public: yesterday’s campaign event in Harrow was stocked with her party’s own candidates, and last week she avoided meeting residents during a visit to a Bristol housing estate, and shut reporters out of a factory visit in Cornwall. The BuzzFeed interview in which Corbyn said he wouldn’t be quitting if Labour were to lose the general election covers more ground, including: his thoughts on current EastEnders storylines (“She’s [Bex] being bullied at school by her mates and she’s turning around in a good way and challenging them. The story is developing in a very, very interesting way.”) Russian hacking (“We’re all under threat from hackers all the time … Let’s not get paranoid about it.”) the non-mainstream media (“I think it’s good that people go to all the alternative sites and check out what they want. I’ve read The Canary quite a bit, I’ve read yours, I do read a lot of them.”) Labour voters who say they won’t cast a ballot for the party as long as he’s in charge (“It doesn’t get to me at all.”) A senior Labour source said the question of Corbyn’s future after the election was a “distraction”, claiming that the focus was fully on the campaign itself, which he described as offering “our plan to transform Britain for the many, not the few”. A fresh Survation poll for ITV’s Good Morning Britain gives the Tories a 17-point lead over Labour: Conservatives 47% (+10 on 2015) Labour 30% (-) Liberal Democrats 7% (-1) Ukip 5% (-9) SNP 5% (-) Greens 3% (-1) Further down the list, it’s not much of a boost for the Lib Dems or Ukip, either. Brexit was the “number one issue” for most voters, with 15% picking that, ahead of the NHS, the economy and immigration. Separate questions on the party leaders put Theresa May consistently ahead of Jeremy Corbyn. Some 60% said she’d make the best prime minister, against 21% for Corbyn. And for a nuanced look at what opinion polls mean and how far – if at all – we should trust them, try Alan Travis’ analysis. Amid a so-far relatively predictably general election campaign, a minor if nonetheless eye-opening surprise could be brewing on the Isle of Wight. The island’s parliamentary constituency is being targeted by the Greens, even though there was a 13,703 Conservative majority in 2015. “I just think it’s a brave person now who makes predictions about what is and isn’t possible in this election,” Lucas says before posing for a promotional photo with some of the party’s 13 local councillors and activists at a local community centre. “I just know from my time on the island that there is such an upswell of people who want to have a progressive MP.” The bullishness is based on several factors, not least last week’s local polls, which saw the Greens win more votes than Labour or the Liberal Democrats on the Isle of Wight. There is also the fact that the Green candidate, Vix Lowthion, a local secondary school history teacher, is the only candidate remaining from the 2015 election, after the sudden political demise of the Conservative MP, Andrew Turner. Lucas accused the Conservatives of showing “an extraordinary complacency” in a seat Turner held since 2001. “I think there’s an appetite for a change. Yes, if you look at the bare figures it will take a big swing, but nevertheless I do feel people on the island are at the end of their tether and the concerns of the island are not being heard.” The sudden evaporation of the Ukip vote, which went from 14,000 at the 2015 election to 900 in last week’s local polls, has provided Lowthion with hope. Jeremy Corbyn is in Manchester this morning, where he’s launching Labour’s official campaign alongside Andy Burnham, who won a thumping victory to become mayor of Greater Manchester last week. Corbyn will talk about Brexit, as reported in the Snap below – to say the matter is settled. What he wants to talk about is what comes next. Labour’s priority, he will say, is to ensure a reckoning for those who thought they could get away with asset-stripping our industry, crashing our economy through their greed and ripping off workers and consumers during the financial crisis. There are four weeks left, he will add, to take our wealth back. Talking to the Guardian yesterday, the Labour leader set out his wishlist: There are obviously many priorities but the crisis of housing and setting in train a housing programme that would build more council housing at socially affordable rents and ensuring there is proper regulation of the private rental sector is a very high priority for me. And he isn’t despondent about last week’s local election losses, he added: Not at all. I don’t do downhearted. So what is Theresa May’s new policy to cap energy bills (that sounds suspiciously like Ed Miliband’s old policy to cap energy bills? Anushka Asthana and Adam Vaughan report: The prime minister will set out plans for an “absolute price cap” on standard variable tariffs to save households up to £100 a year after a government-backed study found customers had collectively been forced to pay £1.4bn a year in “excessive prices”. The rate would be set by the regulator Ofgem every six months in order to prevent it from limiting competition in the market. It would target people who are less likely to switch, including elderly and disabled customers, and who find themselves on over-priced rates as a result. May referred to the policy at a campaign event in Harrow West on Monday where she argued that “capping energy prices to support working families” was in the national interest. (For more on that campaign event – “not an unfamiliar face in sight” – do read John Crace’s sketch.) Although some who lambasted Miliband seem more won over by May’s proposal, former energy secretary and Lib Dem candidate Ed Davey thinks they’re both as bad as each other: It is never a good idea to copy the economic strategy of Ed Miliband. The energy industry is also not keen. British Gas owner Centrica said a cap would push up average prices: Evidence from other countries would suggest this will lead to reduced competition and choice, and potentially higher average prices. Welcome back to today’s campaign live blog. I’m Claire Phipps with your get-up-to-date-before-breakfast briefing, and the early politics news. Andrew Sparrow joins the live blog later. What’s happening? It’s Labour’s official campaign launch today, and Jeremy Corbyn heads to Manchester for the “real fight starts now” moment, with a message that it’s all to play for over the next four weeks. With some exceptions. Corbyn will tell supporters – including newly installed Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham – that Brexit isn’t on the list: This election isn’t about Brexit itself. That issue has been settled. The question now is what sort of Brexit do we want – and what sort of country do we want Britain to be after Brexit? Corbyn’s plan comes with promises on economic fairness, council house building and rental reform – and a vow that, whatever the picture on 9 June, he’ll be the leader of the Labour party. In an interview with BuzzFeed, he said he’d be “carrying on” regardless of the result: I was elected leader of this party and I’ll stay leader of this party. If he wins, he told the Guardian, Brexit won’t be the only thing to remain non-negotiable: I’m an incorrigible runner, cyclist and allotment gardener. Balancing life is important. And would he relish the move to No 10? I’m very happy in the house I’ve got, so let’s work it out when we get there. Meanwhile, the leader of the Conservatives seems rather less keen to hang on to the label. She prefers Theresa May’s Team. She’s also developed a liking for Ed Miliband’s policy to cap energy bills, if her policy to cap energy bills is any clue. Back in 2013, many on the right thought Miliband’s plan was a terribly bad idea. David Cameron trumpeted it as proof the then Labour leader was in pursuit of a “Marxist universe”. “The lights will go out over Britain,” flustered the Daily Mail. No such fears for your EU-unfriendly incandescent lightbulbs this time round. Now capping energy bills is a terribly good idea, according to Theresa May’s Team. Not a terribly good idea is to exhort people to vote for “stability” if you’re not trying to encourage people to vote for the party whose slogan is all about stability. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has had to clarify that a letter he and John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, sent to all parishes ahead of the election was not an endorsement of the Conservative party. Welby told the Guardian: Was the letter a shift to the right? Absolutely not. At a glance: Caroline Lucas joins Green party’s bid to snatch Isle of Wight seat. In an informal “progressive alliance”, the Greens won’t stand against the SNP’s Angus Robertson in Moray, the National reports. May and Corbyn to appear on BBC Question Time special (but not together). Simon Danczuk could stand against Labour after quitting party. Facebook employs ex-political aides to help campaigns target voters. Iain Duncan Smith rap-battles Diane Abbott and nobody knows why and perhaps it’s better that way. Poll position Yesterday’s Guardian/ICM poll was a record-breaker: the largest vote-share ever for the Conservatives in a Guardian/ICM poll, and the biggest Tory v Labour lead in ICM’s history: 22 points. Conservatives: 49% (+2 since last week) Labour: 27% (-1) Lib Dems: 9% (+1) Ukip: 6% (-2) Greens: 3% (-1) For those who think – rightly – that relying on one poll is a bit wobbly, let our new poll tracker put it into context for you. For those who think that all polling is a bit wobbly, our home affairs editor Alan Travis has analysed the caveats. This is quite a big one: It should be borne in mind that when British pollsters do get it wrong, it has tended to be an underestimate of the Tory vote and an overestimate of the Labour vote, so a policy of ignoring the polls is unlikely to provide much comfort for Jeremy Corbyn. Diary The Greens continue their Isle of Wight campaign, with Caroline Lucas launching a health policy in Newport at 9.30am. At 11am Jeremy Corbyn is in Manchester for the official launch of Labour’s election campaign. There will be a battle bus. Expect to see the Lib Dems’ bus if you’re in Penzance: Tim Farron is there for a public Q&amp;A with the readers of Cornwall Live, a rather friendlier hobnob than the news website experienced with the PM last week. Theresa May is in Yorkshire, before hotfooting it to the BBC’s One Show sofa for an interview alongside her husband, Philip May; that’s at 7pm. Talking point The Conservatives are keen to make the win for Emmanuel Macron in France part of their push for votes, and last night rolled out an email from Boris Johnson that they might as well have sent straight to the fact-checkers: Yesterday a new French president claimed a strong negotiating position on Brexit as a result of his election win. It is critical that we have someone of the calibre and strength of Theresa May with an equally strong position and an equally strong mandate to protect Britain in Brexit… As our country prepares to enter talks with the presidents, prime ministers and chancellors of the European Union, now more than ever we need strong and stable leadership. It’s true that Macron is no fan of Brexit, which he’s described as a “crime”. It’s not true – unless he said it very, very quietly and perhaps only to Boris Johnson – that he “claimed a strong negotiating position on Brexit as a result of his election win” (voilá); his chief economic adviser, Jean Pisani-Ferry, said yesterday the new president had no interest in punishing Britain (though he’s probably not minded to make it easy, either). It’s not even clear if the PM and her team will be negotiating with anyone other than Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator. It’s unlikely that May will win 66.1% of the vote. It is, however, true that the “they’re all out to get us” line is a highly effective one: Read these Vincent Boland in the Financial Times looks at the very particular role Brexit is playing in Northern Ireland campaigning: The DUP was the only party in Northern Ireland to support Brexit in the run-up to last year’s EU referendum. But now senior party figures are conceding that Brexit will pose challenges for Northern Ireland that the party may have previously underestimated… Sinn Féin has adopted a fiercely anti-Brexit stance since last year’s referendum. In recent weeks, the nationalist party has appealed to the 56% of Northern Irish voters who voted Remain by demanding a ‘special designated status’ for Northern Ireland within the EU. In the Times, Rachel Sylvester says the centrists in the Labour party need to draw courage from Macron’s win: Of course, the French presidential electoral system is different to the British one; it would be harder for a new party to break through here than it was for a single candidate to come from nowhere to end up in the Élysée Palace – but the gap in the political market for a credible voice of the centre is exactly the same here as it was in France… Critics of a new party always cite the failure of the SDP as evidence that there is no point trying to break the mould, but politics is far more fractured and less tribal than it was in the 1980s. The few remaining traditional loyalties were severed by the EU referendum. Labour’s traditional base has all but disintegrated, with many white working-class voters switching allegiance to the Conservatives (often having gone through the Ukip gateway) and liberal metropolitans feeling alienated by Mr Corbyn. As one MP puts it, with brutal honesty: ‘Labour no longer has a core vote.’ And catch up with the Guardian’s new series, Voices and Votes, which sees six Guardian reporters embedded in constituencies across the country. First up: Hartlepool. Revelation of the day The Mirror reports that the Council of Hunting Associations sees a Conservative landslide as “the chance we have been waiting for” to reintroduce fox-hunting. They think a pledge to hold a free vote on the issue will find its way into the manifesto – as it did in 2010 and 2015, with as much success as the commitment to reduce net immigration to “tens of thousands”.

Alistair Phillips-Davies also called on the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to undertake the widest possible investigation of all aspects of the sector in a bid to clear the air. \"As privatised utilities, we should always view with humility the regulatory, political and public scrutiny on our activities,\" he argued, adding: \"We all have to acknowledge that energy is not perfect and we have to look at reforms that benefit the customer.\" He went on: \"A market reference [investigation] should provide a platform for achieving greater political and regulatory stability for the Great Britain energy market, for the benefit of customers. It must therefore be broad enough.\" The peace overtures from Phillips-Davies, whose company also broke new ground recently by freezing its prices until 2016, contrast with the more aggressive comments in the past from his rivals. Sam Laidlaw, the head of Centrica, was quick to warn about the lights going out when the CMA probe was proposed, saying it would freeze investment in new power stations for another two years. Phillips-Davies was speaking at an event in London organised by the market research company YouGov and Cambridge University, under the banner of Energy, Politics and the Consumer. YouGov used the occasion to release a survey showing more than a quarter of the public strongly believed the big six energy companies failed to act in the best interest of consumers and society, while 67% believed the firms operated a cartel. The poll of 2,000 adults showed customer satisfaction with energy companies is lower than with banks, while over half of poll respondents said they had been forced to turn their heating down or off to keep soaring gas and electricity bills affordable. The damning results give more support to Ofgem and the CMA, which last week called for a full competition inquiry into the energy market after a period of rising profits and increasing customer dissatisfaction. Ed Davey, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, said the YouGov poll confirmed what he had been saying to the suppliers that \"this is a 'Fred the shred' moment\" for the energy industry. \"With the government's action to reduce bills on average by £50, the energy companies have said there should be no prices rises this year unless there is a substantial spike in wholesale costs – and some have gone further by freezing prices for longer. \"And with the full blown competition inquiry proposed by Ofgem, the energy suppliers have a once in a generation opportunity to show people they get it, keep prices down, improve their service and regain people's trust.\" Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, said the poll findings underlined why her party was right to demand an immediate price freeze, but expressed concerns that the probe by the CMA could last till 2016. She said there was little comfort for consumers \"because it leaves them in the bizarre position of being told that competition in this market is not working and the prices they pay are not fair, but that nothing will be done with it for two years.\" In a separate development, more than 100 MPs, academics and businessmen – including Ian Marchant, the former boss of SSE – have put their names to a document urging the European Commission to reject the state aid request from the British government that would enable the building of new reactors at Hinkley Point, Somerset. The signatories – co-ordinated by Paul Dorfman, senior research associate at the Energy Institute at University College, London – oppose the funding of the reactors for a variety of reasons, including cost and safety, but also for potentially distorting the market against wind and other renewable technologies. The document says: \"The development of sustainable and affordable low carbon energy remains a growing economic sector with huge potential for job creation. To seek to delimit this diversity through state aid support of nuclear power at the expense of other potentially more flexible, safe, productive, cost effective and affordable technologies seems, at the very least, unwise.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/apr/20/choice-cumbria-nuclear-dump-mistake-environment-agency","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-20T14:28:23Z","webTitle":"Cumbrian nuclear dump 'virtually certain' to be eroded by rising sea levels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/20/choice-cumbria-nuclear-dump-mistake-environment-agency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/apr/20/choice-cumbria-nuclear-dump-mistake-environment-agency","fields":{"headline":"Cumbrian nuclear dump 'virtually certain' to be eroded by rising sea levels","bodyText":"Britain's nuclear dump is virtually certain to be eroded by rising sea levels and to contaminate the Cumbrian coast with large amounts of radioactive waste, according to an internal document released by the Environment Agency (EA). The document suggests that in retrospect it was a mistake to site the Drigg Low-Level Waste Repository (LLWR) on the Cumbrian coast because of its vulnerability to flooding. \"It is doubtful whether the location of the LLWR site would be chosen for a new facility for near-surface radioactive waste disposal if the choice were being made now,\" it says. The EA document estimates that the one million cubic metres of radioactive waste disposed of over the last 55 years by the civil and military nuclear industry at the site, near the Sellafield nuclear complex in west Cumbria, is going to start leaking on to the shoreline in \"a few hundred to a few thousand years from now\". The agency voices concerns about \"the potential appearance on the beach and in its accessible surroundings, during the process of erosion, of discrete items carrying a significant burden of radioactivity individually\". They could range from tiny particles to larger objects such as hand tools that have become contaminated during use at Britain's nuclear sites then subsequently disposed of at Drigg, the document says. Officials at the EA are considering a plan by the companies that run Drigg to dispose of a further 800,000 cubic metres of waste there over the next 100 years. This will include radioactive debris from Britain's nuclear power stations, nuclear submarines, nuclear weapons, hospitals and universities. Environmentalists argue that continuing to use the site is \"unethical, unsustainable and highly dangerous\". But this is rejected by Drigg's operators, who describe the risks as \"insignificant\". The EA document, dated 9 January 2014, sets out the agency's latest assessment of the risks of coastal erosion at Drigg. It was released by the EA this month in response to a request from The Guardian. Erosion from storms and rising sea levels caused by climate change has \"emerged as the expected evolution scenario\" for Drigg, it says. Experts have concluded that this is almost bound to happen. Although Drigg was meant to be for low-level radioactive waste, there are fears that some of the disposals in the past may have included higher-level wastes. The rest of the nuclear industry's medium and high-level wastes are still awaiting an agreed disposal route, with successive UK governments failing for decades to find a deep burial site. The site, which covers about 110 hectares, is between five and 20 metres above sea level. It is run by a consortium led by the US engineering company URS, the French state-owned nuclear company Areva, and the Swedish nuclear firm Studsvik. The consortium has already been asked by the EA to look at options for improved flood defences. According to Ian Parker, the EA's nuclear regulation group manager in Cumbria, the agency had reached its latest conclusions after detailed technical assessments. \"It's highly probable the coast will erode and the waste will be disrupted,\" he said. The EA was taking \"a very conservative approach\" to reduce risks to future generations, he argued. Further public consultations on the proposal to keep using the site were due in the autumn, and no final decision would be taken until next year. Drigg's operator, LLW Repository Ltd, said it had introduced new restrictions on the amounts of radioactivity that can be disposed of at the site in order to make sure that radiation doses to people will be \"very small\" if the wastes are exposed by coastal erosion. The company's head of science and engineering, Dr Richard Cummings, accepted that erosion could start \"in a few hundred years\". But he added: \"The radioactivity in the wastes will largely have decayed away by this time.\" Carrying on disposing of waste at Drigg was sustainable and ethical because future generations would be given the same protection as now, Cummings said. \"The stringent regulatory requirements we have to meet ensure that even if people in the future forget about the repository and the wastes disposed there, the effects will be insignificant.\" But Martin Forward, from Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment, pointed out that more than 1,200 radioactive particles from Sellafield had been found on nearby beaches in recent years. \"The potent threat of rising sea levels makes the future use of the site unsustainable, unethical and highly dangerous for future generations,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/feb/16/flood-area-defences-funding-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-17T00:21:00Z","webTitle":"Flood area defences put on hold by government funding cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/16/flood-area-defences-funding-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/feb/16/flood-area-defences-funding-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Flood area defences put on hold by government funding cuts","bodyText":"Flood-stricken communities, including those visited by David Cameron in the Somerset Levels and Yalding in Kent, have been left without planned defences following government funding cuts, the Guardian can reveal. Undelivered defences, totalling many millions of pounds, also include schemes on the stretch of Devon coast at Dawlish where the mainline railway fell into the sea and near the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Ministers have been heavily criticised for cutting flood defence spending by almost £100m a year after taking power, but this is the first time specific projects affected by the cuts have been identified. In the heart of the Somerset Levels, a £2.2m scheme to improve flood management on the Parrett, the main river draining the Levels, and the nearby Sowy river, was postponed and currently has no prospect of funding before 2020. In March 2012, an Environment Agency (EA) report on the scheme said: \"The [rivers'] combined function is of great importance to the effective management of floodwaters in the area.\" Another scheme for the Parrett, near the village of Burrowbridge, was in line for £300,000 of funding from 2011-13 but has received nothing. The Parrett overtopped its banks by Burrowbridge in January and the village was cut off. A third scheme for the river, called \"Parrett Estuary – Cannington Bends\", worth £6.2m, covered an area near where it meets the sea, just a few miles from the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point. The defences, which were to be part-funded by Hinkley-owner EDF Energy, would have moved 536 homes out of \"the very significant or significant flood probability category to the moderate or low category\", according to EA documents. In 2010, the agency said the defences \"urgently need updating\" and the Cannington Bends area was heavily flooded in 2012, but the scheme has received no funding under the coalition and is currently in line for only £792,000 in 2016-17. The missing schemes were identified by the Guardian by comparing the flood defence spending plans for 2010-11, the final year of the last government's budget and a high-water mark for flood defence spending, with the plans for subsequent years under the coalition. In an interview with the Guardian the under-fire chairman of the Environment Agency, Chris Smith, welcomes the prime minister's recent \"money is no object\" remark to cope with the fallout of the storms, but wonders whether it will apply beyond the immediate crisis. \"I hope he will apply the same principle to the longer-term issues about improving our flood defences. One of the things that has worried me is whether flood defence is seen by the Treasury as a high enough priority,\" he says. Lord Smith says there would have to be an annual £20m rise in the government's £600m flood defence budget, as well as any inflationary increase, just to maintain Britain's present level of protection. Chris Huhne, the former energy and climate change secretary, claims in a Guardian article that the chancellor, George Osborne, was the driving force behind the cuts in flood defence spending in 2010. The chancellor was then forced to increase flood defence spending last June because insurance companies were threatening to withdraw cover for 350,000 homes at risk, Huhne claims. Other undelivered flood defence schemes now identified include a project in Devon called the Dawlish Warren and Exmouth Beach Management Scheme, the goal of which was \"to reduce tidal flood risk to nearly 3,000 properties and the main railway into the south-west\". It had been in line for £2.7m, but by March 2015 will have received only a third of that. The village of Yalding in Kent began flooding on Christmas Eve, with people evacuated by boat and helicopter, and Cameron was heckled by angry locals during a visit a few days later. It had been in line for £200,000 of flood protection funding between 2011 and 2013, but has received nothing and there is no current plan for spending in the area. It has also been established that about £5m is being spent between 2011 and 2015 on the Levels to improve the condition of seven sites of special scientific interest where otters, birds and important plants live, as well as to provide more storage for floodwaters. In total, about 1,500 hectares of water-dependent habitat are being improved, thereby avoiding heavy fines under EU environmental directives. Flood defence funding rose sharply under the last government, following the recommendations of the Pitt review into the catastrophic floods of 2007. Under the coalition, annual spending fell to at least £90m below 2010-11 levels until 2013-14. In July 2012, the Guardian identified 294 flood defence schemes across the whole of England that had been in line for funding but had not gone ahead. A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which provides the funding for flood defences, said: \"We have spent £2.4bn on flood management and protection from coastal erosion over the past four years. We will continue to build defences where they are needed.\" Lord Smith says: \"The agency works within clear government guidelines on where to spend the funding it is given to maximise the protection for people and property.\" Lord Krebs, the government's lead independent adviser on adapting to the impacts of climate change, said: \"Ministers are perfectly entitled to say 'look we just don't have enough money and we will have to accept a greater risk of flooding.' That is a political judgment which needs to be made.\" But he said cutting flood defence spending was a false economy, as each scheme saved £8 in damage for every £1 spent: \"In the long term these measures pay for themselves.\" Krebs warned that without a change of approach to improve flood protection in line with the rising risk from climate change, the current \"firefighting\" approach to the crisis would be the only one available. \"Up to now climate measures have been seen as a long-term issue and it is always difficult for governments to think about long-term issues,\" he said. \"But sometimes it takes a crisis like this to wake people up. Let's deal with the short-term emergency, but I would be very sad if this was all put back in the filing cabinet afterwards.\" In his interview, Smith accepts that the EA's response to the flooding has not been perfect. He says it should have pushed harder for the money to dredge the rivers on the Somerset Levels, and he should have visited the county earlier to show support. \"There was a whole rest of country to worry about. I was up on the Humber looking at the damage from the storm surge and elsewhere. But I probably should have gone to talk with people down there at an earlier stage.\" Smith says more than 5 million people in Britain are at risk of flooding, and that the government has to recognise the dangers. \"Flooding knocks out businesses, it knocks out employment, it costs a huge amount to restore. This is something quite apart from the human distress. Government has to give flood defence a higher priority.\" Small and medium-sized firms that have been flooded or suffered significant loss of trade will be able to apply for help from the new Business Support Scheme announced by the prime minister. A helpline is also being set up to provide advice. Cameron said: \"The government is taking action across the board to deal with the clear-up and help hard-working people affected by the floods. Dealing with these floods will be a long haul, requiring a stepped-up national effort with the whole country pulling together. We will continue to help the people who need help and protect the communities that need protecting.\" The business secretary, Vince Cable, said: \"It is vital that small businesses affected by the flooding get assistance as quickly as possible. We know the insurance companies are working to process claims as quickly as possible and we will inform local authorities of their allocations from the Business Support Scheme on Thursday to assist businesses with clean-up costs or help them to continue trading.\" Large swaths of Britain remain on high alert, with severe flood warnings still in place along the Thames and in Somerset. Forecasters predicted some respite this week as largely fine weather with lighter winds and less rain is expected for the next five days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/jan/06/wind-power-spain-electricity-2013","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-06T13:39:50Z","webTitle":"Wind power was Spain's top source of electricity in 2013","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/06/wind-power-spain-electricity-2013","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jan/06/wind-power-spain-electricity-2013","fields":{"headline":"Wind power was Spain's top source of electricity in 2013","bodyText":"Remarkable new figures from Spain's grid operator have revealed that greenhouse gas emissions from the country's power sector are likely to have fallen 23.1% last year, as power generation from wind farms and hydroelectric plants soared. Red Eléctrica de España (REE) released a preliminary report on the country's power system late last month, revealing that for \"the first time ever, [wind power] contributed most to the annual electricity demand coverage\". According to the figures, wind turbines met 21.1% of electricity demand on the Spanish peninsular, narrowly beating the region's fleet of nuclear reactors, which provided 21% of power. In total, wind farms are estimated to have generated 53,926 gigawatt hours of electricity, up 12% on 2012, while high levels of rainfall meant hydroelectric power output was 16% higher than the historical average, climbing to 32,205GWh. \"Throughout 2013, the all-time highs of wind power production were exceeded,\" the report stated. \"On 6 February, wind power recorded a new maximum of instantaneous power with 17,056MW at 3:49 pm (2.5 per cent up on the previous record registered in April 2012), and that same day the all-time maximum for hourly energy was also exceeded reaching 16,918MWh. Similarly, in January, February, March and November wind power generation was the technology that made the largest contribution towards the total energy production of the system.\" An increase in wind power capacity of 173MW coupled with an increase in solar PV capacity of 140MW and solar thermal capacity of 300MW meant that by the end of the year renewables represented 49.1% of total installed power capacity on the Spanish peninsula. In contrast, the preliminary figures show that power output from combined cycle gas plants fell 34.2% year-on-year, coal-fired plants saw generation fall 27.3%, and nuclear power output fell 8.3%. The dramatic shift towards renewable generation coupled with a fall in overall power demand of 2.1% led to a similarly drastic reductions in emissions from the peninsular's power sector. \"The increased weight of renewable energy in the generation mix structure of 2013 compared to the previous year has reduced CO2 emissions of the electricity sector on the Spanish peninsula to 61.4 million tonnes, 23.1% lower than in 2012,\" the report stated. The study follows news last year that Portugal had successfully generated over 70% of its power from renewables during the first quarter of the year, driven by a surge in wind and hydro power output. The latest figures are likely to be seized upon by renewable energy firms as further evidence that the sector can provide a high proportion of power to a modern economy without risk of blackouts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/aug/24/ed-miliband-labour-opinium-poll-ratings","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-24T18:43:14Z","webTitle":"Ed Miliband sees slide in personal ratings as Labour's support stabilises","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/24/ed-miliband-labour-opinium-poll-ratings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/aug/24/ed-miliband-labour-opinium-poll-ratings","fields":{"headline":"Ed Miliband sees slide in personal ratings as Labour's support stabilises","bodyText":"Labour has halted a decline in its poll rating following its summer of internal bickering, but Ed Miliband's personal ratings continue to slide, according to the latest Opinium/Observer poll. Miliband's party, unchanged since a fortnight ago on 36%, retains a seven percentage point advantage over the Conservatives who are also unchanged on 29%. UKIP is up once percentage point on 18% and the Liberal Democrats down one percentage point on 8%. Two weeks ago Labour's lead slipped by three percentage points compared with the two weeks before, possibly the result of negative media coverage of Miliband's performance and a lack of energy at the top of the party. While the lead is now steady, the decline in Miliband's net approval ratings looked more alarming in poll after poll. Four weeks ago Miliband's net rating was -22. Now it stands at -31. The decline is not dramatic but gradual. A fortnight ago 21% said they approved of Miliband's performance, against 47% who said they disapproved. Now just 19% approve and 50% disapprove. David Cameron's personal ratings have dropped since mid summer when they were around -15%. Now 32% approve of his performance against 50% who disapprove, leaving a net rating of -18, while 13% approve of Nick Clegg's leadership and 60% disapprove, giving the Lib Dem leader a net score of -47. Opinium also asked for whether people approved or disapproved of a range of energy generation projects in their areas, including wind farms, nuclear power stations and drilling for shale gas, known as \"fracking\". Wind farms were the most acceptable with 68% of likely voters saying they were in favour of them in the UK, and 60% content to have to them in their own areas. Nuclear power polarised views the most sharply, with 44% in favour of it in the UK and 30% opposed. However just 26% were in favour of nuclear plants in their area with 47% opposed. On fracking, voters were evenly split with 32% happy for it to take place in the UK and 33% against. But just 23% were happy for it take place in their localities. There was a clear male/female divide on fracking, with men fairly evenly divided (32% in favour and 38% against) while women were divided with 51% opposed and just 15% in favour. • Opinium Research carried out an online survey of 1,947 GB adults aged 18+ from 20 August to 23 August.

These are stand-alone and separate exhibitions but they do have some intriguing conceptual links, not the least of which is a shared fascination with models, miniatures and dioramas. Although the works have that relationship, and are both made by Japanese artists, they approach their subjects in very different ways. Paramodel is the duo Yasuhiko Hayashi and Yusuke Nakano. Their name is a blending of the words “plastic” and “model” as well as being a play on the Japanese word puramoderu meaning plastic model, which aptly describes their work. The duo set out with an expansive if limited set of materials – blue plastic toy train lines, toy cement mixers, garbage trucks and cranes, and a vast array of styrofoam, coloured cardboard and paint. Using a computer program to help design their detailed installations, the artists and an army of helpers then set up the work in the gallery space. The work has a two stage effect on the viewer. First, you’re bowled over by the intensity of the pattern of the work – the blue plastic train lines are unifying outlines that wind their way around the room covering floor, walls and ceilings, while the loops, circles and islands created by the pattern are filled with mountains of sculpted styrofoam and populated with tiny toy animals – Friesian cows, wombats, kangaroos among them – all arranged to create a kind of fractal repetition, echoing in their orientation another space on the wall or ceiling. This is where the second part of Paramodelic-Graffiti’s effect kicks in. At first it feels as though nothing is happening – always a sure sign the experience is going to be stronger than you anticipated – but very slowly the patterns in the work begin to take on a three dimensional effect even within the 2D components of the work. From what began as a benign experience, the piece becomes a genuine psychedelic freak out. Ryota Kuwakubo’s The Tenth Sentiment is another miniature world that’s just as painstakingly designed and set up as Paramodel’s and with a similar transformative effect. On the carpeted floor of a darkened room there appears to be a tiny N-scale toy train engine making a circuitous journey on a tiny track. The engine has a miniature but very powerful LED light on it. As the engine snakes around the floor it passes blocks of wood, light bulbs, pencils and tiny toys, passes through paper tubes and a colander, then continues on past peg, pencils and many more everyday objects placed strategically next to the tracks. As the light hits these objects shadows are cast on to the gallery walls creating what looks like cities, nuclear power stations, forests and farm lands. The journey from one end of the track to the other takes 13 minutes but it feels like no time has passed. The effect is mesmerising. Models, miniatures and dioramas present us with an idealised and simplified version of the world. When we look down on them we can’t help but imagine what it would be like to rest under that bonsai oak, or walk through an architects model, or to observe toy dinosaurs in a real primeval swamp. Kuwakubo’s The Tenth Sentiment does all that, yet reveals the illusion behind the magic. And what is so memorable about the piece isn’t that although we know how the trick is being done, we don’t care, it seems to make the experience all the more special."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2013/sep/04/fukushima-radiation-deadly-new-high","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-04T06:03:00Z","webTitle":"Fukushima radiation leaks reach deadly new high","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/04/fukushima-radiation-deadly-new-high","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/sep/04/fukushima-radiation-deadly-new-high","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima radiation leaks reach deadly new high","bodyText":"The crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has radiation leaks strong enough to deliver a fatal dose within hours, Japanese authorities have revealed, as the government prepares to step in to help contain leaks of highly toxic water at the site. On Wednesday the country's nuclear regulation authority said radiation readings near water storage tanks at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have increased to a new high, with emissions above the ground near one group of tanks were as high as 2,200 millisieverts [mSv] per hour – a rise of 20% from the previous high. Earlier this week the plant's operator, Tepco, said workers had measured radiation at 1,800 mSv an hour near a storage tank. That was the previous highest reading since Tepco began installing tanks to store huge quantities of contaminated water that have built up at the plant. An unprotected person standing close to the contaminated areas would, within hours, receive a deadly radiation dose. The nuclear regulation authority said the radiation comprised mostly beta rays that could be blocked by aluminium foil, unlike more penetrative gamma rays. Tepco's admission in August that about 300 tonnes of radioactive groundwater is escaping into the nearby Pacific Ocean every day, and the more recent discovery of leaking storage tanks and pipes, prompted the government to inject more than £300m to contain the water crisis. The emergency measures, announced on Tuesday, involve building a mile-long impenetrable frozen wall beneath the plant to prevent groundwater from mixing with contaminated coolant water. The coolant becomes tainted after coming into contact with melted uranium fuel deep inside the damaged reactors. Currently about 400 tonnes of groundwater are streaming into the reactor basements from the hills behind the plant each day. The water is pumped out and held in about 1,000 storage tanks. The tanks contain 330,000 tonnes of water with varying levels of toxicity. Officials are conducting a feasibility study into the frozen wall, with completion expected by March 2015. Although the technology isn't new, the scale of the Fukushima Daiichi project is unprecedented for an atomic facility. The government also wants to speed up the development of a new water treatment system that can remove most radioactive substances from the water. Tepco has already constructed once such facility but it has not been used since equipment was found to have corroded during a trial run. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he understood the growing concern at home and overseas about the state of the plant but said his government was now \"taking the lead\" to solve the problem. \"To do that we are resolutely implementing drastic measures.\" Abe, who will make Tokyo's final pitch in the city's bid to host the 2020 Olympics at a meeting of the International Olympic Committee in Buenos Aries this weekend, added: \"I will be explaining to the IOC that in seven years' time, 2020, it will not be a problem at all.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/nov/07/1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-07T16:36:36Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: Sellafield, ash dieback and rare whales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/07/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/nov/07/1","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: Sellafield, ash dieback and rare whales","bodyText":"Environment news • Sellafield audit shows safety costs spiralling • Cameron set to defend coalition's position on green economic growth • Ash dieback: politicians and experts meet to discuss strategy • Laos holds 'groundbreaking' ceremony for contentious Mekong dam • Prop 37: Californian voters likely to reject GM food labelling • UK beaches are dirtiest in a decade, figures show • No Dash For Gas ends the UK's longest power station occupation On the blogs • Can ash dieback be stopped in the UK? | Leo Hickman • All hail the Times's Cycle Safe, but don't hold your breath for a revolution • Ukip's Godfrey Bloom and the £2,000-a-month climate researcher • If Sandy doesn't destroy Obama's climate cowardice, what will?

Namie's 21,000 residents remain evacuated because of continuing high radiation levels, the product of the March 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station, six miles to the south. Homes, shops and streets are deserted except for the occasional police patrol or checkpoint. Like the setting for a Hollywood post-apocalypse movie, grass and weeds poke up through cracked pavements. At an abandoned garage, a rusting car sits on a raised ramp, waiting for a repair that will never be completed. A feral dog peers from a wild, untended garden. Namie is nobody's town now. Nobody lives here, and nobody visits for long. Even the looters have stopped bothering, and no one knows exactly when the inhabitants may be allowed to return permanently – or whether they will want to. The 2011 catastrophe faded from world headlines long ago, but in Namie, Tomioka, Okuma, Futaba and other blighted towns in the 20-mile evacuation zone around the Fukushima plant, it is a disaster that never ends. At the plant itself, recent leaks of contaminated water into the sea and a fraught operation to remove fuel rods from one of the damaged reactors have shown how critical the situation still is – and will remain during a decommissioning process that could take up to 40 years. For Fukushima's displaced population, the effects of the disaster continue to be deeply felt. The evacuation area was subdivided earlier this year into three zones of higher or lower radiation risk. In the worst affected zone, return will not be allowed before 2017 at the earliest. In other areas, families and businesses face difficult decisions about whether or not to go back. At present, no one is even allowed to stay overnight. Locals say that whatever happens, many younger people will not return. There is little or no trust in official pronouncements, given the failure of the Fukushima Daiichi operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), to take adequate measures to protect the plant against the tsunami and the company's unimpressive post-disaster record. There are suspicions that the government knows some towns may never be safe to live in again, but refuses to admit it in order to protect Japan's unpopular nuclear power industry. There is also a sense that Fukushima's victims have been forgotten. That said, the painstaking cleanup continues and there has been some progress in adjoining, less badly affected areas, according to Hiroshi Murata, the head of the Odaka ward of Minamisoma City, close to Namie. As many as 18,000 people died or were declared missing in Fukushima prefecture after the tsunami struck. The radiation plumes caused the forced evacuation of a further 154,000, according to the Japan Reconstruction Agency. In Odaka, 148 people died, and there were more than 300 fatalities in Minamisoma as a whole. But now around 53% of Odaka residents have returned home, a total of 6,800 out of a pre-disaster population of 12,800, Murata said. Nobody has died directly as a result of the nuclear disaster, but a close eye is being kept on the incidence of thyroid cancer in children, following the experience of Chernobyl. The biggest issues the local administration now faces, following the rehousing of residents in temporary accommodation, are the demolition of unsafe houses, replacement of infrastructure and services, including roads and school playgrounds, and the decontamination and desalination of buildings and land. \"To decontaminate one house and garden takes 10 to 14 days,\" Murata said. \"We have to remove surface soil, cut the trees, wash the roofs, clean the rain gutters. The house owners are responsible for cleaning inside. The city and the government help with the rest.\" At least in Odaka there is something to clean and repair. In Ukedo, the part of Namie municipality closest to the Pacific ocean, the devastation is total. Hardly a single house was left standing by the tsunami, which reached 17m in height in some places, Murata said – a vast wall of water that devoured all in its path. Wrecked fishing boats still lie stranded miles inland and there are vast piles of scrap metal, smashed cars, bits of concrete bridges and broken wooden house frames where once a thriving village stood. An abandoned elementary school, 500m from the sea, looks as though it has been bombed. But even in Ukedo, a long line of displaced local resident volunteers can be seen picking up and sorting debris on a wintry afternoon, gradually clearing the land where homes formerly stood. With impressive organisation, the local authorities are recycling everything they can, bagging it up in vast compounds erected amid the bleak, salty flatlands that were once rice paddy fields. Tetsurou Eguchi, the deputy mayor of Minamisoma City, said the radiation-related cleanup was likely to take another five to six years and could cost as much as ¥350bn (£2bn), much of which would come from the national government. Post-tsunami reconstruction would take up to 10 years. But something intangible had been permanently lost, he said. \"When it comes to the economy, and individual and social life, it is very difficult to recover this, compared with how it used to be.\" The most challenging problem, he said, was decontamination. \"Basically [the radioactive fallout] is not in the air any more. It's in the soil.\" The area was dependent economically on small businesses, agriculture, fishing and tourism, including the famous annual Soma Nomaoi samurai festival, he said. All had been seriously affected. \"People don't believe it is safe to visit here. They won't believe our produce, our livestock, our fish are safe. There is a blight. This will take a long time to change.\" Much had been said by the national government about supporting Fukushima prefecture in its efforts to get back on its feet, but the reality is different, Eguchi said. \"It is a fact that we have received quite a lot of support, but is it sufficient? That is difficult, because it's not just a question of reconstruction. Politicians in Tokyo say if Fukushima does not recover, Japan will not recover, but I'm not sure they really mean that. \"I don't think Fukushima is fully supported by the whole country. And that's what the citizens here think.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"guardian-professional/2013/aug/20/labour-party-conference-brighton-sunday-22-september","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-professional","sectionName":"Guardian Professional","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-20T12:40:06Z","webTitle":"Labour party conference - Brighton:  Sunday 22 September","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional/2013/aug/20/labour-party-conference-brighton-sunday-22-september","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-professional/2013/aug/20/labour-party-conference-brighton-sunday-22-september","fields":{"headline":"Labour party conference - Brighton:  Sunday 22 September","bodyText":"17.30 Investment in infrastructure – powering the economy Chair: Michael White, associate editor, the Guardian Alistair Dormer, executive chairman and chief executive officer, Hitachi Rail Europe John Longworth, director general, British Chambers of Commerce Alan Raymant, chief operating officer, Horizon Nuclear Power Iain Wright MP, shadow minister for competitiveness and enterprise The Guardian in partnership with Hitachi Europe Ltd 19.30 Women in public life: where are they?

A report by members of the governing Liberal Democratic party [LDP] and its junior coalition partner urges the government to abandon its promise to all 160,000 evacuees that their irradiated homes will be fit to live in again. The plan instead calls for financial support for displaced residents to move to new homes elsewhere, and for more state funding for the storage of huge quantities of radioactive waste being removed from the 12-mile evacuation zone around the plant. The parties' admission that some areas closest to the wrecked facility will remain too contaminated for people to make a permanent return is a blow to official assurances that radiation can be brought down to safe levels. The government has come under pressure to abandon those promises amid evidence that attempts to reduce radiation to its target of 1 millisievert a year are failing. Decontamination is woefully behind schedule in seven of the 11 selected towns and villages, forcing authorities to concede recently that they will not finish the work by the March 2014 deadline. The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], is supposed to pay back government loans to fund the cleanup, but has balked at the huge expense while it focuses on a costly decommissioning operation at Fukushima Daiichi that is expected to last at least 30 years. The government is prepared to borrow another 3tn yen to compensate evacuees and speed up decontamination of homes, schools and other public buildings in areas where reducing radiation levels is more realistic, reports say. The new funding will bring Japan's expenditure on the nuclear crisis so far to $80bn (£50bn). That figure does not cover the cost of decommissioning the damaged reactors. \"At some point in time, someone will have to say that this region is uninhabitable, but we will make up for it,\" the LDP's secretary general, Shigeru Ishiba, said recently. It now appears that officials will abandon efforts to clean up highly irradiated areas closest to the plant and focus on areas where there is a more realistic chance of success. The evacuated region is divided into areas where people may return but not stay overnight, those that are preparing for similar status, and those that will remain no-go zones for at least five years because radiation doses exceed 50 millisieverts a year. The last category includes the small town of Okuma, where evacuated residents told the Guardian more than two years ago that they had given up all hope of ever returning. On Tuesday, evacuees reacted with anger at the government's about-turn. \"Politicians should have specified a long time ago the areas where evacuees will not be able to return, and presented plans to help them rebuild their lives elsewhere,\" Toshitaka Kakinuma, a 71-year-old Okuma resident living in nearby Iwaki, told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Mental illness, alcohol abuse and physical ailments such as deep-vein thrombosis owing to inactivity are reportedly on the rise among tens of thousands of Fukushima evacuees still living in temporary housing units. As of August, the number of people in Fukushima who died from illnesses connected to the evacuation stood at 1,539, just short of the 1,599 deaths in the prefecture caused by the 11 March tsunami. Few evacuees say they would go back, even if they could. In Okuma, just 10% of residents want to return to their old homes; the figure is 12% in Tomioka, one of the most heavily contaminated villages. Some experts have criticised as unrealistic the government radiation target of 1 mSv a year. The UN's international commission on radiological protection [http://www.icrp.org] states that annual doses of up to 20 mSv pose no demonstrable threat to human health. The government reportedly hopes to persuade residents to return to areas with atmospheric doses below 20 mSv a year, while keeping the 1 mSv level as a long-term goal. Meanwhile, Japan's popular former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has challenged plans by the current leader, Shinzo Abe, to restart nuclear reactors next year. Koizumi, who stepped down in 2006 after five years in office, called on Abe to build on his popularity by honouring the wishes of the majority of Japanese, who want nuclear power phased out. \"[Abe] should use the power given to him to do what the majority of the people want,\" Koizumi said in a speech at the Japan Press Club. \"It can be achieved. Why miss this chance? \"It is too optimistic and irresponsible to assume we can find a final radioactive waste storage site in Japan after the accident,\" he said, adding that even burying waste underground for 100,000 years could pose a threat to future generations. \"What language should we use to convey the hazards to those people in the future?\" he said. All 50 of Japan's working reactors are offline while safety checks are carried out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/jul/13/five-unresolved-issues-iran-nuclear-programme-vienna-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-13T15:42:27Z","webTitle":"Five unresolved issues over Iran's nuclear programme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/13/five-unresolved-issues-iran-nuclear-programme-vienna-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jul/13/five-unresolved-issues-iran-nuclear-programme-vienna-talks","fields":{"headline":"Five unresolved issues over Iran's nuclear programme","bodyText":"With a deadline looming for Iran and the west to seal a comprehensive agreement to resolve a decade-long confrontation over Tehran's nuclear programme, five key issues remain to be resolved. Enrichment The biggest obstacle to a deal is the fundamental question of how big the Iranian nuclear programme should be. The key issue here is the country's capacity to enrich uranium. The six world powers negotiating with Iran in Vienna want Tehran to be satisfied with a research-scale capability involving a few thousand centrifuges, so less than its current capacity of 19,000 centrifuges, of which 10,000 are spinning. It is a critical issue because the smaller the capacity the longer the \"breakout time\", the period it would take Iran to make a bomb, if Tehran took that decision. So the smaller the capacity, the greater confidence the rest of the world would have that it would have more than six months warning that Iran was making a dash to a warhead. The Iranians say such a limit would be a violation of Iran's right to pursue a peaceful nuclear programme, including producing fuel for its own reactors. The supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, declared recently that Iran would need a capacity equivalent to over 200,000 of the old-model centrifuges it is currently using, in order to supply fuel to its nuclear power station in Bushehr, a research reactor in Tehran, and a new reactor under construction in Arak. Western diplomats point out the Russians have a contract to supply Bushehr with its fuel rods until 2021 at least, and it would be dangerous for everyone in the Gulf region if Iran tried to use domestically-made rods. Russian warranties on the reactor would no longer apply. Iran counters that the lesson it has drawn from the history of its nuclear programme is not to rely on foreign governments. This will be the hardest divide to bridge, not least because Khamenei has publicly made it a matter of national pride. One possibility is a phased solution in which there is an agreed low ceiling for enrichment for a few years, and later expansion is dependent on proven need and high marks for transparency from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Another is for Russia to provide several years' fuel for Bushehr in advance, to overcome any doubt over reliability of supply, and the stockpile would be stored in Iran under IAEA safeguards. Arak For more than 12 years, Iran has been building a heavy water reactor in Arak, which is now close to completion. Officially it is for the production of isotopes for various industrial, agricultural, medical and other scientific uses. Western sceptics point out the planned reactor is more powerful than would be needed for such uses. They believe it is for the production of plutonium, another route to make a bomb, which is created as part of the spent fuel. Iran refuses to scrap the project, saying it has invested a lot of time and money in it, building a heavy water production plant nearby. But this could be a relatively easy issue to fix. A change in design would mean it would produce less than 1kg of plutonium a year, rather than the 9kg expected from the existing blueprint, which would be nearly enough for two warheads. Iran would undertake not to build a reprocessing facility for extracting the plutonium, which would be exported as part of the spent fuel. Iran officials have said they are already working in that direction. Past weaponisation work The question of whether Iran had a large-scale programme to develop technologies for making a warhead, at least until 2003 as most western intelligence agencies believe, has not been resolved. For many years, IAEA inspectors have been presenting a shopping list of requests to see documents, interview scientists, and visit suspects sites, but have made little progress. The matter is being dealt with outside the main talks, in a series of meetings and visits between IAEA and Iranian officials, but the two issues are inevitably linked. It would be hard to imagine a comprehensive deal on Iran's programme without the questions about the past development work being settled, as it concerns the fundamental issue of whether the international community trusts Iran to be transparent about its nuclear activities. The big short-term problem is how to dovetail the two negotiating tracks: the six powers and the IAEA, so the latter does not become an obstacle to the former. Oversight Long-term increased scrutiny by IAEA inspectors would have to be part of any nuclear deal. At a minimum, this would involve a regime of enhanced inspections which the IAEA calls the \"additional protocol\". This would involve access by inspection teams to all parts of the nuclear cycle, from uranium mining onwards, and would allow them to take environmental samples anywhere they deem fit. Most western diplomats say they will demand a programme of even more intrusive inspections, \"additional protocol plus\". The Iranians may balk at this, as their touchstone is to be treated like any other state. However, it is possible to envisage an intense period of inspections and monitoring that would diminish over the time, as mutual confidence between the parties grows. Sanctions Sanctions relief is the main bargaining chip the six powers have in their hands at the negotiating table, and it is one of the thorniest issues, because having placed sanctions on Iran, western governments are going to find it hard to take them off. Over the years, the US and EU have gone beyond measures agreed at the UN, and built up a tangle of interlocking and overlapping punitive restrictions on doing business with Iran. The most serious constraint on sanctions relief is that the Obama administration does not have it in its gift to permanently lift sanctions. Only Congress can do that, and Republican legislators are no mood to cooperate. The president can grant temporary waivers but that does not impress the Iranians, who are wary of being tricked. The EU could lift its oil embargo and financial restrictions, but only if there is consensus. Buying Iranian oil and gas would go a long way towards rescuing the country's economy, as would allowing insurance of Iranian shipping, and unfreezing an estimated $100bn in Iranian oil revenues held abroad. The problem of US sanctions and Congress could be sidestepped because some of the American sanctions have a sunset clause that means they lapse next year anyway."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/feb/14/taiwan-asia-pacific","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-14T14:06:00Z","webTitle":"Taiwan presses ahead with home-built nuclear power plant despite safety fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/14/taiwan-asia-pacific","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/feb/14/taiwan-asia-pacific","fields":{"headline":"Taiwan presses ahead with home-built nuclear power plant despite safety fears","bodyText":"Even the head of the safety department at Taiwan's Atomic Energy Council, has doubts about the country's fourth nuclear plant, suggesting it no longer enjoys much support. But since the presidential election on 14 January, plans to finish Nuclear Power Plant Four are back on the agenda. The victorious Kuomintang party has committed itself to bringing the facility online by 2016, provided it meets safety requirements. The opposition Democratic Progressive party had promised that, if elected, it would halt the plant's commissioning. At present, almost one-fifth of the island's electricity comes from nuclear power. Taiwan's first three nuclear facilities were turnkey projects subcontracted to General Electric and Westinghouse, the leading US companies in this business. But the NPP-4 is the result of a laborious process supervised by Taipower, the public electricity utility. \"Taipower had no previous experience of nuclear power stations before taking charge of the NPP-4,\" says Aiya Hsu, of the Green Citizens' Action Alliance. The scheme has been interrupted and restarted several times for technical and political reasons. \"The longer the project went on, the more it cost and the more cost-cutting there was,\" says a Taipower employee. The list of defects on this unfinished construction job is long. Two senior executives resigned in late 2011 to highlight their concerns. According to opposition MP Tien Chiu-chin, Taipower calculated in 2000 that it would cost NT$80bn ($2.6bn). \"Now it will end up costing four times as much. It has not even been commissioned yet it is already rated as one of the world's most dangerous plants by the World Nuclear Association,\" she adds. What poses the most immediate nuclear risk in Taiwan, however, is its the haphazard handling of radioactive waste. Since the first nuclear reactor started operating 34 years ago the authorities have been storing the waste in situ. Due to its complex political predicament, deprived of a seat in the UN and not officially recognised as a legitimate state, the Republic of China cannot have its spent fuel reprocessed abroad. Neither Beijing or Washington wish to see Taiwan recover plutonium – that could be used for military ends from reprocessed waste. So the three existing power stations are packed with highly radioactive waste, which in the event of an accident could pose a serious hazard. The six reactors' cooling ponds now contain almost four times the amount originally planned. In the mid-1990s Framatome, the French nuclear conglomerate, now Areva, doubled the capacity of the storage racks at the Maanshan plant. But scientists remain concerned about the exceptional waste concentration at the facilities. According to Chiu Syh-tsong, head of AEC's fuel cycle department, the first ponds will reach capacity in 2014. He thinks that the priority should be to speed up the construction of an onsite dry storage facility. Some of the ponds have already caused concern. In June 2010 the Taipei Times published an account by the head of Midco Diving and Marine Services, a US firm contracted to clean up the ponds at NPP-1. One of the ponds was allegedly a tip, and the divers removed ordinary rubbish, including diving gear, bottles, cables and other detritus. As for low-level radioactive waste, the \"interim\" repository, built on Orchid Island in the early 1980s, has been full for the past five years, according to Professor Peter Chang, head of the Radiation Protection Association. In 1999 the organisation revealed the presence of caesium-137 in neighbouring sweet potato fields and taro paddy fields, suggesting leakage. The government says that it has now identified suitable land to accommodate surplus waste, but not a single municipality is prepared to accept such a facility. Taipei is also thought to be negotiating with several other countries to take its waste. But the cost would be high and there is no sign of a successful outcome.

David Davis was widely criticised by Labour and SNP MPs for being unable to give details of the government’s Brexit plans as he used a Commons statement to set out the process the government will follow as it negotiates EU withdrawal. In her response Emily Thornberry, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: What we’ve heard instead hasn’t been a strategy, it hasn’t been a thought out plan, it’s just been more empty platitudes from a government that just continues to make it up as it goes along. Davis gave the clearest sign yet that the government will abandon single market membership as part of its Brexit settlement. In response to a question from the Labour Eurosceptic Kate Hoey, who asked Davis to accept that it was not necessary to be a member of the single market to access it, Davis agreed. He replied: Access to the single market is not really up for grabs. It is there for everybody. There are many, many countries, many countries outside the European Union, that do a better job, frankly, of exporting to the single market than we do, even without a trade arrangement. So of course we want to have access to the single market. We don’t need to be a member of it to do it. Indeed, being a member of it has caused some of the problems of sovereignty that this referendum was driven by. Later, when the pro-European Tory Anna Soubry asked Davis to confirm that he was willing to abandon single market membership, Davis replied: What I’m saying is that this government is looking at every option. But the simple truth is that if a requirement of membership is giving up control of our borders, I think that makes it very improbable. Davis said he did not accept the claim that there was a trade off between getting control of immigration and protecting free trade by remaining in the single market. It was a false choice, he argued, because it was in the interests of both sides to promote free trade. (See 4.46pm.) He said the government’s post-Brexit immigration system would be “more rigorous” than a points-based system. He said Theresa May was “very clear” in her comments in China earlier. She was concerned that a points-based system was too open-ended, that it did not actually put a control on the number of people coming to the UK. And therefore she wanted something which sounded like it would be more rigorous not less. He said he would oppose any attempt to undermine workers’ rights as part of the Brexit settlement. He said this in response to a question from Labour’s Angela Eagle (see 5.05pm) using language very similar to that he used in his ConservativeHome article in July. In that article he said: The great British industrial working classes voted overwhelmingly for Brexit. I am not at all attracted by the idea of rewarding them by cutting their rights. He said the government would have to decide whether or not it wanted to remain part of the European customs union before invoking article 50, starting the formal EU withdrawal process. (See 5.20pm.) He refused to say whether the UK would remain part of Europol. Labour’s Yvette Cooper asked this. Davis said the government wanted to preserve the relationship with the EU on security matters as best we can. He went on: “Of course we are aiming to maintain that. And that’s the answer.” But he seemed to be making a general point, not answering the specific question about Europol. That is how Cooper interpreted his answer. He said the government would try to establish a national consensus on Brexit. As we proceed, we will be guided by some clear principles. First, as I said, we wish to build a national consensus around our position. Second, while always putting the national interest first, we will always act in good faith towards our European partners. Third, wherever possible we will try to minimise any uncertainty that change can inevitably bring. And, fourth, crucially, we will – by the end of this process – have left the European Union, and put the sovereignty and supremacy of this parliament beyond doubt. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. David Davis has just finished taking questions. The session went on for more than two hours, and John Bercow, the Speaker, said 85 backbenchers asked questions. I will post a summary shortly. The SNP’s Pete Wishart says Davis’s statement was “meaningless waffle”. Davis says, for all the SNP’s objections, the EU referendum vote has done nothing to increase support for independence in Scotland. Henry Smith, a Conservative, says the words “European Union” should be removed from the British passport as soon as possible. Davis says he will pass that message on to the home secretary. Labour’s Paula Sherriff asks for an assurance that the UK will be able to abolish the tampon tax once it leaves the EU. Davis says Sheriff has given an example of why it is important to leave the EU. Countries should be able to set their own tax rates, he says. Davis says there was undoubtedly a downward dip in confidence after the Brexit vote. That was partly because people said Brexit would be bad for the economy. But confidence has recovered, he says. Davis says the common travel area with Ireland will continue after the UK leaves the EU. Here is my colleague Anushka Asthana and Peter Walker’s story about the David Davis statement. Nigel Evans, a Conservative, asks when the UK will get its hands on the Brexit dividend. At some point after we have left, Davis says. Labour’s Stephen Timms asks if it is possible that the UK could remain a member of the single market at the end of this process. Davis says he wants the best possible access to the single market. But that does not have to involve being a member, he says. John Baron, a Conservative, asks Davis to accept that the immigration policy after Brexit should not discriminate against non-EU citizens. Davis says he is not home secretary. He says his job is to bring the powers back; it is the home secretary’s job to exercise them. But he thinks Baron makes a good point. The Conservative Peter Bone asks Davis when he thinks we will leave the EU. Davis says that was a good try. He suggests that Bone was a good seducer in his youth, but says he won’t be seduced by him. Davis says he takes the views of those who voted in the referendum very seriously. He wants to make this process as open as possible. But this is a negotiation, he says, and you do not negotiate with your cards turned face up. The Conservative MP Philip Davies asks Davis to confirm that the government’s red lines in the negotiation will involve control of immigration, no more money going to the EU and the UK no longer being subject to EU law. Davis says someone on the frontbench has just joked that he should have not problem with that. But he does not want to give away the government’s negotiating position, he says. But he says his view of the EU referendum was that it was a vote for taking back control. Some Labour MPs are taking to Twitter to express their concern about how little content there is in Davis’s statement. Davis says he has been struck by the tendency of the papers over recent weeks to blame everything on Brexit. Here is some comment from journalists on the Davis statement. From BuzzFeed’s James Ball From the BBC’s Glenn Campbell From the Times’ Patrick Kidd Davis says the most successful countries in the world at negotiating free trade deals, like Chile and South Korea, do not have to give up anything apart from agreeing free trade. Davis says there is no point having a vote on invoking article 50 in the Commons. But that does not mean MPs will not debate the issue. He would urge MPs to bring forward concerns raised by their constituents. Here is Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader and deputy prime minister, on David Davis’s statement. The SNP’s Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh asks what assessment the government has made of the impact of Brexit on the Scottish economy. Davis says he has not done that assessment yet, but that his department will do that. He wants to ensure this outcome serves all parts of the UK, he says. Here is the full text of David Davis’s statement. Mark Harper, the Conservative former chief whip, says the government should not rush decisions over Brexit as Labour is demanding. Davis says he will take no lessons in organisation from Labour. The Conservative Anna Soubry asks if the government has given up plans to remain in the single market. Davis says it is hard to see how the UK can remain in the single market if it wants to control immigration. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chair of the Commons Treasury committee, asks Davis to confirm that the UK will not remain a member of the customs union. Davis says being in the customs union puts limits on what a country can do outside it. The government is looking at this carefully, he says. This is one of the matters to be resolved before article 50 is invoked. Davis says government will decide whether it wants to remain in the EU customs union before invoking article 50. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, says the idea of invoking article 50, and thereby abandoning EU law and the property rights for Britons that go with it, troubles him greatly. Davis says he did not spend all the time he did on the backbenches defending civil rights to give them up easily. Michael Gove, the former Vote Leave leader, congratulates Davis on his appointment. He says there has been a record increase in service industry and manufacturing industry growth since the Brexit vote. And other countries are pressing for free trade deals. The German vice chancellor says the EU/US trade deal is dead. So doesn’t that prove that the British public have more expertise than all these so-called experts like the IMF and the OECD and the others who all have “oeuf” on their face. (Gove is speaking in a rather odd accent - a Scottish, high-pitched Enoch Powell. It’s very peculiar.) Davis thanks Gove for his comments, but says he would be a bit more cautious than Gove at this point about Britain’s economic prospects. Labour’s Angela Eagle asks if parliament, and the British people, will get a say on the deal that is done. Davis says his views on the importance of parliamentary accountability have not changed since he left the backbenches. On employment rights, he says many of those who voted for Brexit were members of the industrial working class. He says it is no part of his brief to undermine their rights. Davis suggests he would oppose any attempt to undermine workers’ rights as part of Brexit. Peter Lilley, the Conservative former cabinet minster, says withdrawal needs to take place quickly. Can Davis confirm two years is a maximum? Other countries that have obtained independence have done so in less than two years. Davis says Theresa May has said the British people want the government to get on with it. But it is important to get it right. He would rather wait an extra month before invoking article 50 to get it right than go a month early and get it wrong. The Conservative Owen Paterson says when countries like India got independence, they lifted all UK laws into Indian law. Then, over time, they went through those laws and abolished the ones they did not want. Can’t the UK do the same with EU law? Davis says originally he thought that, but it is not quite that straightforward, because of the way EU laws interacts with UK law. Davis says the EU cannot stop the UK talking to other countries about trade deals now. The only thing the UK cannot do is agree those deals. But talks are taking place already, he says. He says he has studied article 50, and it is clear that article 50 does not prevent parallel trade talks taking place as withdrawal is being negotiated. Davis says the single market is there for everyone. Some countries that are not members of the single market are better at selling into it than countries that are members. Davis says it is not necessary for Britain to remain a member of the single market. Labour’s Ben Bradshaw says Theresa May said more in her briefing with journalists in China than Davis did in his statement. Will he confirm that the three Vote Leave promises - a points-based immigration system, £100m a week for the NHS and a cut to VAT on fuel - are in tatters. Davis address the immigration point. He says Brexit could lead to immigration controls being more rigorous, not less rigorous. Labour’s Yvette Cooper says David Davis has not given any answers on important matters of detail. Will the UK remain a member of Europol? Davis says justice and home affairs matters are being considered. The government wants to maintain security cooperation he says, implying it would maintain Europol membership. I will post the exact quote late. UPDATE: I have listened to the tape again, and taken out the original line saying Davis suggested the UK would remain a member of Europol. Davis refused to say whether the UK would remain part of Europol. Labour’s Yvette Cooper asked this. Davis said the government wanted to preserve the relationship with the EU on security matters as best we can. He went on: “Of course we are aiming to maintain that. And that’s the answer.” But he seemed to be making a general point, not answering the specific question about Europol. That is how Cooper interpreted his answer. Ken Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, says he looks forward to the moment when the government agrees on what Brexit actually means. He says David Davis did not take part in the ignorant and prejudiced attacks on foreigners during the campaign. Does he agree that most people are not hostile to foreigners living here so long as they obey the law? So will the government not turn away foreigners whom employers wish to employ for the sake of it? Davis says he agrees with Clarke entirely that the “sort of unpleasantness” that has sometimes arisen out of this should be wholly condemned. But he says that when people complain about immigration, they are not being xenophobic. And he says he does not accept that there is a trade off between controlling immigration and boosting free trade. A free trade deal is in the interests of both sides, he says. Davis says he does not accept there is a trade off between controlling immigration and protecting free trade. The SNP’s Europe spokesman, Stephen Gethins, starts by asking “Is that it?” David Davis has told us very little, he says. David is responding to Thornberry. He says it is something to be accused of incompetence by Labour. Labour seems to be adopting a “load, fire, aim” strategy, he says. On immigration, he says the government wants a results-based immigration strategy. He says Labour backed the idea that the decision on Brexit should be taken by the British people. Now Labour are trying to undo that. That is something “up with which we will not put”, he says (part-quoting Churchill). Emily Thornberry, the shadow Brexit secretary, is replying. She says it is eight years since Davis was last at the despatch box. His last words from the front bench were ‘You’ll have to answer’. He will have to answer, he says. She says Davis’s departmental website does not even have a phone number on it. Theresa May has said what she will not do. But she has not said what she will do, she says. She says Davis said two months ago (in his ConservativeHome article) that the negotiating strategy would have to be “properly designed”. But there is no strategy, she says. She says Davis has always spoken up for the rights of parliament. So he cannot believe it is right for the government to invoke article 50, starting the EU withdrawal process, without consulting parliament, as the government says it intends to do. She says that parliament must be given a vote on this. And she says Davis would say that himself if he were a backbencher. He says parliament will be kept regularly informed. Until the UK leaves, it must respect EU laws, he says. He says the government will keep paying farmers the subsidies get from the EU until 2020. And he says the government wants to ensure that EU citizens living in the UK can stay. He says he wants us to come together as one nation so we can get the best deal for the UK. We will leave the EU but we will not turn our back on Europe. Davis says his officials are carrying out a sectoral analysis, looking at how Brexit could affect 50 different business sectors. He says his department is fully engaged with the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. He says his first meeting was with the general secretary of the TUC. He has also met with universities, charities and business groups, and is meeting other bodies too. Davis says his department has 180 staff in London. And it has the support of 120 staff in Brussels. He says the government will be guided by four principles. First, the government will try to establish a national consensus. Second, it will put the national interest first. Third, the government will try to minimise uncertainty. Fourth, the government will leave the EU and put the supremacy of parliament beyond doubt. Davis says negotiating with the EU must be got right. So the government will take time to get it right, he says. He says economic indicators are strong. And he pays tribute to the work of George Osborne. Davis says Brexit is not about ending our relationship with the EU. It is about starting a new one. The government wants free trade, he says. David Davis, the new Brexit secretary, is giving his Commons statement now. He starts by stressing that the UK will leave the EU. There will be no second referendum, he says. The government will honour the decision of the people. Brexit means leaving the EU, he says. It means getting control of our borders, our laws and our money. This is not about making the best a bad job, he says. This is an historic and positive moment for our nation. Brexit isn’t about making the best of a bad job. It is about seizing the huge and exciting opportunities that will flow from a new place for Britain in the world. There will be new freedoms, new opportunities, new horizons for this great country. David Davis, the new Brexit secretary, will make his statement to the Commons shortly. It will be the first Commons statement from a member of the new government on Brexit strategy. Davis actually wrote a long article for ConservativeHome on what he thought the government should do only days before his surprise appointment as Brexit secretary. You can read it in full here, and a summary here. In the Commons the Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood has been responding to Labour’s urgent question about Yemen. These are from the Telegraph’s Laura Hughes. Labour’s Keith Vaz has just asked Ellwood a question. This is from the i’s Nigel Morris. Theresa May’s meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at the end of the G20 summit seems to have gone quite well. This is from my colleague Rowena Mason. This is from the Financial Times’ George Parker. And this is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. In the Commons Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, asked the government to clarify its plan for immigration rules post-Brexit. His question was answered by Robert Goodwill, the immigration minister, who sidestepped the question and just focused on attacking Labour’s record. Keith Vaz is asking a question now in Home Office questions. He starts by welcoming Amber Rudd to her post and asks if the government will change the law to ensure that suspects on bail have to hand over passports to police. Rudd says the government is looking at this, and may adopt this policy. Vaz seemed a bit more subdued than usual, but for someone who has just been turned over by an embarrassing and potentially career-wrecking newspaper sting, he was looking remarkably resilient. Keith Vaz is now in the chamber, the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman reports. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, is taking questions in the Commons at the moment. According to Channel 4 News’ Michael Crick, Keith Vaz is planning to ask a question. Owen Smith, the Labour leadership contender, has put out a press notice on immigration that manages to criticise both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. He said: Theresa May has presented a totally confused vision of what Brexit means for Britain to the international community. More than two months after the referendum we are still no closer to having any answers to the critical questions about immigration and access to the single market. As a result, we have had dire economic and jobs warnings from key trading partners - the USA and Japan - and a totally chaotic response when asked about what kind of migration arrangements Britain should have with the EU. Labour should be offering a powerful opposition to this Tory shambles, demanding a seat at the negotiating table and providing an alternative vision for our future. Yet Jeremy Corbyn has failed at every stage, from the lacklustre campaign to stay in the EU to calling for Article 50 to be triggered immediately after the result. At her first PMQs Theresa May looked remarkably confident and assured but this afternoon, at what was her first press conference in her new post, she looked rather more like the prime ministerial novice that she actually is. It was not that she was at all poor or incompetent; it was just that she sounded a bit nervous (she was speaking more quickly than necessary) and the reporters seemed to be getting frustrated by her reluctance to engage with the specifics of their questions about Brexit. There is nothing unusual about politicians refusing to answer questions. But getting away with it harder than it looks, and one was reminded that her predecessor used to do this stuff very well. Here is my colleague Dan Sabbagh on her performance. And here is Bloomberg’s Robert Hutton. We did not learn much new about the government’s Brexit plan. I will probably be writing that sentence again after David Davis’s Commons statement, and probably quite regularly for the rest of the decade. In truth May and her team may have little idea what the final Brexit settlement will look like and, as they try to craft a deal acceptable to both Nigel Farage, the CBI and the EU, the outcome is likely to emerge slowly and haphazardly. (That’s why David Cameron once said a Brexit vote would mean “three years of Euro-wank.) But some of May’s comments were moderately revealing. Here are the key points. May said that leaving the EU would give the UK “some control” over EU migration - suggesting that the restrictions on EU migration might just be partial. She said that at present the UK could not restrict EU migration. She went on: What we will now have an ability to do, which we haven’t had before, is when we come out of the EU, we will be able to have some control on movement of people coming from the EU into the UK, which of course was one element over which we weren’t able to have control before. It is not entirely clear what May meant, but hardline anti-Europeans like Nigel Farage (see 9.33am) are likely to be worried by her tone. My colleague Alan Travis says this could be a hint that free movement could remain for EU citizens with job offers in the UK. May explained why she was ruling out a points-based immigration system. A points-based system did not give the government discretion over who came in, she said. She explained her point with a story about what she learnt when she visited Heathrow to speak to Border Force staff with David Cameron after they took office. And we talked to Border Force officers there. And we said to them, ‘What’s the most important thing that we can focus on?’ And they said, ‘You need to look at the issue of students who come here, who appear to have met the criteria, they don’t speak English, they don’t know which institution they are going to and they don’t know what course it is they’re doing’. So the system is being abused. But because they met the criteria, they were automatically allowed in. And that’s the problem with the points-based system. I want a system when the government is able to decide who comes into the country. I think that’s what the British people want. A points-based system means that people come in automatically if they just meet the criteria. Asked what alternative system the government would adopt post-Brexit, May said there were “various ways” for the government to assert control over migration into the UK. “We will be coming forward in due course with proposals,” she said. She hinted that she had lost confidence in Keith Vaz as chair of the Commons home affairs committee. Asked about his conduct she replied: What Keith does is for Keith and any decisions he wishes to make are for him. But I think overall what people look for is confidence in their politicians. She reaffirmed her commitment to make the UK “the global leader in free trade” and she said she had been encouraged by how many world leaders were interested in striking trade deals with the UK. She said India, Mexico, South Korea and Singapore had all expressed an interest in removing barriers to trade. And she said Australian trade minister to visit UK this week to for “exploratory discussions” on UK/Australia trade deal. She said she would be chairing a meeting of the cabinet committee on Brexit and international trade later this week to discuss which markets to prioritise. She sidestepped a question about whether she had been able to reassure Japan on any of the Brexit demands it is making on behalf of Japanese firms based in the UK. She said the government would publish a consultation paper on tackling corporate irresponsibility in the autumn. To restore greater fairness, we will bring forward a consultation this autumn on measures to tackle corporate irresponsibility: cracking down on excessive corporate pay and poor corporate governance and giving employees and customers representation on company boards. Here are Theresa May’s comments on Keith Vaz. And here is the Mirror’s Kevin Maguire on what she said. UPDATE: Here’s another tweet on this from Maguire. Q: Will you be able to sort out Brexit in two years? Or will there have to be transitional arrangements? May says she will not trigger article 50 before the end of the year. Once it is triggered there will be a two-year deadline. The G20 talks have shown here there is a genuine willingness to engage with the UK on trade deals. She wants the best deal for the UK, but she thinks the deal will be good for Europe. And that’s it. I will post a summary soon. Q: The MPs’ code of conduct says MPs have to act with probity and integrity. Are you confident Keith Vaz has acted in this way? May says what Vaz does is up to him. But people should be able to have confidence in their politicians, she says. Q: The Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has talked about the need to “civilise capitalism”. Was that a theme of the conference? May says she was pleased to hear echoes of what she has been saying in the UK around the table at the G20. Other leaders accept the need to ensure that globalisation works for everyone. Other leaders, including Turnbull, were interested in what she had to say about corporate irresponsibility. Q: What alternative to a points-based system would you have? And why should people trust you to cut immigration when you did not as home secretary? May says the government will come forward with immigration plans in due course. As home secretary she did start getting to get the migration numbers down, she says. In the future the UK will be able to have “some control” over people coming into the UK from the EU. May says a decision about the Hinkley Point power station will be taken next month. But the UK’s relationship with China is not just about Hinkley. She want to continue Britain’s strategic relationship with China. May turns to the points-based system proposal. She says people voted to bring back control. But a points-based system does not meet that. She says when she was home secretary, she and David Cameron went to Heathrow to meet border officials. They told them that people could meet the criteria for coming as students. But that when these foreign students arrived, it would turn out that they could not speak English and did not even know the name of the college where they were supposed to be studying. So points-based systems are flawed, she says. May is now taking questions. Q: Most G20 leaders think the UK should stay in the single market. Are you worried you might harm the economy by leaving the single market so that you can control migration? May says she wants the best deal for the UK. Voters want immigration controlled, but they want to trade too. She intends to be “ambitious” and to get the best deal for the UK. Q: Can you address any of the worries in the Japanese government’s 15-page memo? May says she has been saying Brexit means Brexit because it does. But she has found it encouraging that other world leaders are willing to talk about trade deals. She spoke to the Japanese prime minister, and they both want to build on their relationship. The best vote of confidence since Brexit came when the Japanese bank SoftBank bought ARM. May says the G20 agreed that more must be done to tackle the causes of mass migration. The summit has been successful, she says. The UK continues to play a leading role in the world, she says. She say this has been her first visit to China. She looks forward to her talks with the Chinese president shortly. May says the government will hold a consultation this autumn on tackling corporate irresponsibility. May says government to publish consultation in the autumn on tackling corporate irresponsibility. She says moves like this are essential if the government is to retain public support for free trade. On free trade May says Britain has been one of the longest advocates for free trade. The right trade agreements can be the best anti-poverty measures of all time. That is why the G20 has decided to resist a move towards protectionism, she says. She says as the UK leaves the EU she wants the UK to become “the global leader in free trade”. May says she wants UK to be “the global leader in free trade”. May lists various countries that have agreed at the G20 to pursue free trade deals with the UK. And she says she will chair a cabinet committee on free trade later this week to decide what countries the UK should prioritise for trade deals. Theresa May is giving a press conference in China. She is making an opening statement, saying she is optimistic about the UK’s prospects after Brexit. There is an urgent question on Yemen (see 11.23am) at 3.30pm. That means the David Davis statement on Brexit will not start until around 4pm. After that there will be a statement from Jeremy Hunt on the junior doctors’ strike. In his BBC News interview the Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin also said that Britain would leave the EU free market after Brexit. He said he thought Britain would be able to continue trading tariff-free with the EU. But if the EU did impose tariffs, it would not matter, he said. If they go for tariffs, so be it. Sterling has already depreciated by more than the average of the tariffs, so it won’t affect our exports to them. We will make a great deal of money out of the tariffs we collect on their goods coming to us. If they want that, I think it’s anti free trade, but I don’t think will do the economy any harm in this country. Paddy Ashdown, the former Lib Dem leader, likened Tory Brexiteers to Nazis in a tweet this morning. The Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, a prominent Brexiteer himself, told BBC News that Ashdown was being ridiculous. We know he is one of those who is utterly grief stricken that we have abandoned the federalist project in Europe. But this is ridiculous. He is trying to write a narrative that the pro-Brexit Conservatries are coming for the Conservative leader. Look - the war is over; you can come out now. Old grey bearded people are still on deserted pacific atolls who think the war is still carrying on - I think Paddy Ashdown is painting himself into that corner. In a subsequent tweet Ashdown suggested he was not really calling Tories Nazis. The Theresa May press conference in China has been delayed, but it is due to start shortly. I will be covering it in detail, and we will have a live feed at the top of this blog. Earlier I quoted the ComRes poll for the BBC on attitudes to Brexit. Polling Digest, a website that publishes polling analysis, has published a post looking at the figures in some detail. Theresa May might not raise the issue of Chinese steel dumping blamed for crippling the UK industry at her first meeting with president Xi Jinping on Monday. A UK official source said it may not come up in the half-hour of talks as May believes there has already been some progress in cutting overproduction after progress at a G20 level. Overproduction of steel in China has been blamed for the crisis engulfing the UK industry, threatening Tata’s plants and others. David Cameron was last year criticised for failing to raise the issue strongly enough with the Chinese during Xi’s state visit and not responding quickly enough to the threat to jobs in the industry. However, the issue still does not appear to be a top priority for May during her initial talks with Xi, which are already likely to be tricky because the prime minister is considering whether to block China from investing in UK nuclear power. The UK official source said it was being dealt with at G20 level and progress is being made. The reason why every country has signed up to this approach is that there are countries including China which have excess production that they are dealing with. If you look at the measures the Chinese have taken to reduce their capacity, they are dealing with hundreds of thousands of job losses in China because of their own excess capacity. It is a factor that flows out of the downturn in the global economy post the crash which now means it is an issue the G20 are having to deal with. We have already made progress in a wider forum. It is their first bilateral... And from our perspective we have made important progress here in getting acknowledgement at the G20 level. In contrast, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, used the G20 summit to call for tougher monitoring measures in China to deal with steel overcapacity that has plunged the industry into crisis in parts of Europe including the UK. “This is a global problem, but with a specific Chinese dimension we have to address,” Juncker said at a press conference. “We are really insisting on the need to take this seriously.” Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, has accused the government of generating confusion about its immigration policy. The referendum was a major decision and what the country needed more than anything else was leadership from ministers. But instead, we are getting confusion from the Tory government on its immigration policy. A number of members of the cabinet made this pledge and voters will be surprised to see the prime minister rip it up without any consultation. The government must clear this up without delay. Burnham’s comment is not especially accurate. In one important respect what we’ve had today is not confusion but clarity; Number 10 has said categorically that it won’t introduce a points-based immigration system. And on the basis that what the PM says, goes - as good a rule as any, when it comes to understanding how the British government works - this is now the government’s position. Burnham is right about about confusion in one respect, because no one knows what immigration rules will apply post-Brexit. But many other aspects of the post-Brexit settlement remain a mystery too. In his interview with Nick Clegg published in the Guardian at the weekend Simon Hattenstone quoted Clegg complaining about newspaper columnists who become politicians. Clegg said: You’ve got a generation of politicians very close to the media, people like Boris Johnson and [Michael] Gove, and the problem is, the skill of tossing off 800 words on one subject and then on another a week later is completely different to governing. With Cameron and Osborne, there was a seriousness about what they were doing – a deadly seriousness I often didn’t like. But with Gove it was just a series of throwaway poses about our kids’ futures. There’s this ersatz intellectual heft that Gove and his people have that I don’t think is merited. People such as Gove and Johnson have elevated striking poses into a political art form. As if on cue, the Times as announced that Gove, who was sacked by Theresa May when she became prime minister, is joining the paper as a columnist. As part of his leadership campaign Jeremy Corbyn has this morning announced plans to invest £300m in renewable energy research. He would channel the money through a new Advanced Research Agency, he said. My pledge to establish a dedicated Advanced Research Agency will help tackle the global social challenge of climate change and make fundamental breakthroughs in energy science. It will put the UK in the best possible place to take advantage of the rapidly growing global renewable energy market, forecast to reach $630bn worldwide by 2030. The Tory cuts to the UK renewables sector – including dramatically cutting feed-in tariffs and subsidies for domestic installation – are nonsensical and a damaging backwards step in our efforts to decarbonise our energy production. My pledge is about ensuring that the UK is at the forefront of world-leading technology development in a sector of growing demand. In a Commons written statement this morning Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, says the government will continue selling arms to Saudi Arabia because there is no proof that they might be used to commit human rights abuses in the conflict in Yemen. Here is my colleague Patrick Wintour on his statement. And here is my colleague Peter Walker’s story on the Owen Smith press conference. At his news conference Owen Smith said he was not in favour of a universal basic income, the Independent reports. Smith said that Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell’s interest in the universal basic income idea was an example of their “not being credible on economic policies”. The Institute of Directors has backed Number 10’s decision to rule out a points-based immigration system. This is from Seamus Nevin, head of employment and skills policy at the IoD. The prime minister is correct to highlight problems with points-based immigration systems and to be wary of trying to copy the Australian model. The UK’s points system for non-EU migrants is already hopelessly bureaucratic, governed by 13 different Acts of Parliament and creating 1,400 categories of immigrant. Nevin said the government should launch a comprehensive immigration review “that will enable it to design a British system that addresses public concerns, while still allowing businesses to access the skills they need to ensure economic success outside the EU”. At a news conference this morning Owen Smith, the Labour leadership challenger, has published a spoof Conservative manifesto for 2020. He said that if Jeremy Corbyn were re-elected leader, the Tories could win the next election with an increased majority and that it was important for people to know what they might do. The Tories have already done serious damage to our country. Now facing a weak, unpopular and incompetent Labour leader in Jeremy Corbyn, all indications are now that they will be able not just to hold on in 2020, but to win with an increased majority. Jeremy’s unpopularity with the public is so strong that the Tories are emboldened. They no longer feel constrained by the risk of losing votes to Labour: they will be confident enough to argue for right-wing policies they have always believed in - and to win with them. The consequences for Britain - and especially for the people Labour has always stood up for - could be disastrous. The document runs to 12 pages and you can read it here (pdf). It may not be the most fair or accurate assessment of Theresa May’s policy agenda, but some of it is very plausible. Smith says all the proposals in the spoof manifesto are ideas that have been floated by Tories or Tory thinktanks in the past and there are almost 50 footnotes proving this. Here is an excerpt from the spoof foreword to the manifesto, purporting to be what Theresa May would be writing in 2020. We have also been a reforming government. We have liberalised our education system – I am proud that we have extended the Free Schools programme and begun the construction of new selective schools for the first time in two decades. I am pleased that we have begun a decade long task of spreading that same level of freedom throughout our health service. In the past the Conservatives have promised to cut the deficit, not the NHS – but we have delivered more than we promised and successfully managed to cut both. We have also continued our revolution in the welfare system, cutting back unnecessary programmes and getting welfare spending further under control. This manifesto seeks to build on those achievements and do more: It is a manifesto that will ensure we eliminate the deficit within five years and reduce public spending to 30 per cent of GDP, the lowest level since the 1930s. It is a manifesto that ensures that we increase selection within our education system. It is a manifesto that ensures we have a reformed healthcare system through the introduction of a new private health insurance system of the future as opposed to the outdated nationalised health service of the past. It is a manifesto that will increase home ownership by selling off all remaining social housing. It is a manifesto that further reduces unnecessary burdens on businesses by abolishing corporation tax, making Britain a tax haven for global big business whilst also radically cutting red tape. This manifesto is the right plan of action – our plan to take our country forward. Above all, it is the most radical plan to change our country in a generation. With no opposition, it is a plan we will deliver in full. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, has issued a statement challenging the cabinet minister who campaigned for Vote Leave to explain what they will do now Number 10 has ruled out their proposed points-based immigration system. Farron said: My question for the Brexiteers like [Liam] Fox, Boris [Johnson] and [David] Davis is this – what are you going to do now? Are you going to fight for the points-based immigration system you so vigorously proposed? Or are you happy to sit round the cabinet table, with your red boxes and chauffeur driven cars, and look the other way? Nicola Sturgeon is offering to form a coalition with members of the UK government who want Britain to remain in the European single market. This follows the first minister’s directly challenge to Theresa May on Friday over her mandate to take Scotland out of the single market. Sturgeon said her initial objective was to strengthen the hand of those ministers within the UK government who want a soft exit from the EU. In an interview with BBC Scotland’s political editor Brian Taylor, Sturgeon said: Can there be a coalition across the UK that gets the UK into a more sensible position? I think that’s worth a good try because Theresa May, she was on the Remain side, so presumably she knows the real risks of removal from the single market. Sturgeon insisted that she wants full membership, not just access, of the single market. Let’s have a try at getting the UK, not into the best position - because the best position in my view would be continued membership of the EU - but let’s try and get the UK as a whole into the least worst position and that means staying in the single market. At a meeting of SNP MPs and MSPs last Friday, Sturgeon suggested that leaving the single market would be a potential red line in triggering a second independence referendum, stating: “My message to the prime minister is this: you may have a mandate in England and Wales to leave the EU but you do not have a clear mandate to take any part of the UK out of the single market.” Speaking to reporters on her flight to China Theresa May appeared to rule out introducing a points-based immigration system. (See 9.33am.) Downing Street has now gone even further and ruled out the idea unequivocally. A Number 10 spokesman told reporters: One of the opportunities of Brexit is that we will be able to control the number of people coming to Britain from the EU. The precise way in which the Ggvernment will control the movement of EU nationals to Britain after Brexit is yet to be determined. However, as the PM has said many times in the past, a points-based system will not work and is not an option. When Labour introduced a points-based system, the numbers went straight up. In Australia, they have a points-based system and they have higher immigration per capita than Britain. A points-based system would give foreign nationals the right to come to Britain if they meet certain criteria: an immigration system that works for Britain would ensure that the right to decide who comes to the country resides with the government. The Japanese government has published a 15-page open letter setting out in considerable detail what it wants to the UK to achieve in its Brexit negotiations. You can read the full letter here (pdf), an analyis by the Guardian’s diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour here and a summary of the demands by the Guardian’s Phillip Inman here. On the Today programme this morning Koji Tsuruoka, the Japanese ambassador to London, said Japanese firms could leave the UK if they did not get the right deal post-Brexit. Hundreds of Japanese companies were based in the UK, he said. They are companies responsible to their stakeholders and their duty is to produce profit. If the way Brexit ends up does not provide companies with a prospect of making sufficient profit to continue operating in the UK, of course there is no option that they can’t choose. All options are open to them. Tsuruoka’s tone was very moderate. He said that Japanese companies were in the UK because “they all agree that the UK is the best place to do business in Europe” and that they did not want to have to leave. However, there is a negotiation that will have to be conducted and if these requests are not met, then it will be for industry to decide what to do. It is very difficult to imagine that all Japanese companies - including the auto companies - will be pulling out in totality from UK, because the UK economy will be here and vibrant and it will be a good market for auto manufacturers to continue to sell their cars. The problem we will have to confront is what is the market that could be accessed for production outside of the UK? If there are conditions that block Japanese auto makers’ cars being exported to continental Europe, such as customs duties, that of course will affect the competitive nature of the pricing of the cars. At the G20 summit in China Theresa May has held a meeting with her Australian counterpart, Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull told reporters afterwards that Australia would be “getting in to deal with the British early” and wanted a “very strong, very open free trade agreement”. May also said that she wanted Britain to be even more outward-looking after Brexit. She told Turnbull: I’m very clear that [Brexit] doesn’t mean that we are going to be inward-looking. In fact, we want to be even more outward-looking around the whole of the world. And obviously, Australia, with our long-standing ties and our close relationship, will be one of the first countries we will be looking to. In her briefing with journalists on her flight to China Theresa May appeared to rule out introducing a points-based immigration system, despite this being one of the key proposals from the winning Vote Leave campaign. This is what May actually said: You really don’t want to ask a former home secretary about the intricacies of a points-based system because it might take a very long time to answer your question. One of the issues is whether or not points-based systems do work. May said what people wanted was “an ability to be able to control the movement of people from the European Union ... not free movement as it has been in the past.” She left reporters with the impression that EU citizens could still take priority over non-EU citizens under the immigration rules that will eventually be adopted post-Brexit. Nigel Farage, the outgoing Ukip leader, has responded this morning by issuing a statement criticising May’s stance. He said: Theresa May’s track record on immigration as Home Secretary was appalling and her comments rejecting an Australian-style points system really worry me. There is already huge anxiety out there in the country regarding Theresa May’s reluctance to trigger article 50. Her rejection of the type of migration system so many went out there and voted Leave to see implemented indicates serious backsliding. The people were clear in wanting a points-based immigration system which is why so many went out and voted to Leave the European Union. Any watering down from that will lead to real anger. Farage also said it would be “totally unacceptable” to give EU citizens priority under the post-Brexit immigration rules. Given that myself and others also campaigned for a migration system that would treat all who wanted to come equally, any preference for EU nationals would be totally unacceptable. If the establishment think they can stitch-up Brexit then they better be ready for the huge electoral consequences from a British public who on June 23rd voted for radical political change and now expect it to be delivered without failure. MPs return to the Commons today after their summer recess and the highlight will be a statement from David Davis, the new Brexit secretary, about the government’s plans for leaving the EU. We’ve been told that Brexit means Brexit, but beyond that relatively little has been said about what Brexit will entail and Davis’s statement may enlighten us (but probably only marginally - don’t expect the full negotiating prospectus). In a statement released overnight Davis stressed that Britain’s future outside the EU would be marvellous. Brexit isn’t about making the best of a bad job. It is about seizing the huge and exciting opportunities that will flow from a new place for Britain in the world. There will be new freedoms, new opportunities, new horizons for this great country. But hang on. On her flight to the G20 summit in China, in a briefing with journalists, Theresa May gave a rather more sober assessment of Britain’s prospects. She told the hacks: Now I’m not going to pretend it will be plain sailing. There’ll be some difficult times ahead. Like the cabinet, the public at large also seems uncertain about the implications of Brexit. The BBC is focusing on Brexit today and it has released a poll showing that, while 62% of people are positive about Britain’s future after the EU referendum, 35% are negative. Some of the other poll findings are more awkward for the Brexiteers. A quarter of Britons have considered leaving the country since the Brexit vote, the poll reveals. Almost twice as many Britons think the UK’s reputation abroad has been damaged by the Brexit vote (46%) as think it has been improved by the vote (27%). The ComRes summary of the poll is here, and the full tables are here (pdf). Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Owen Smith, the Labour leadership challenger, holds a press conference to publish a document setting out the implications if the Tories win the election in 2020. 11.30am: Theresa May is due to hold a press conference at the G20 summit in China. 2.30pm: Amber Rudd, the new home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 3.30pm: David Davis, the Brexit secretary, makes a statement to the Commons about the government’s plans for leaving the EU. 4.30pm: MPs will hold a debate in Westminster Hall on the e-petition signed by more than 4m people calling for a second EU referendum.

Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, will unveil the plans on Wednesday after delivering a speech setting out plans for £375bn of infrastructure spending over the coming decades. He said taxpayer support for solar and onshore wind would be cut as developers were finding ways to install them more cheaply. The changes relate to so-called \"strike prices\" for subsidies after 2015, which give energy companies a guaranteed price for electricity produced from renewable sources and nuclear power. Essentially, the taxpayer provides a top-up on the market price of power. David Cameron had come under pressure from backbench Tory MPs and some ministers over the impact of windfarms and solar parks on the countryside in their constituencies. However, Alexander said the overall level of subsidies would remain the same and stressed his commitment to helping the UK meet its climate change targets. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I believe passionately in meeting this country's obligations on tackling climate change and meeting environmental commitments, but we should be doing so in the most cost-effective way we can.\" However, the plan was criticised by Labour for undermining certainty for investors in renewables so soon after previous cuts to financial support for onshore wind farms and solar panels. Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"They're just chopping and changing all the time – very bad for stable, long-term investment.\" It comes after ministers negotiated cuts to the energy company obligation – a programme to help poor households reduce their energy usage – as part of a deal with the big six firms to bring down gas and electricity bills by £50. Earlier this week, Tim Yeo, chairman of the Commons energy committee, warned the cuts could open the door to a further attack on green levies, which make up less than 10% of energy bills."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2015/oct/31/russian-passenger-plane-crashes-in-egypts-sinai-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-31T17:09:30Z","webTitle":"Russian plane crash: investigation into cause begins – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/oct/31/russian-passenger-plane-crashes-in-egypts-sinai-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2015/oct/31/russian-passenger-plane-crashes-in-egypts-sinai-live","fields":{"headline":"Russian plane crash: investigation into cause begins – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re wrapping up our live coverage of the plane crash. Here’s what we know: All 224 on board, including 17 children were killed, when a Metrojet flight from Sharm el-Sheikh bound for St Petersburg when the Airbus A321 crashed into the Sinai desert. Images of the wreckage show that the plane was almost completely destroyed. The cause of the crash remains unknown and claims of responsibility from Islamic State have been dismissed by Russian authorities. Families of the passengers have gathered at St Petersburg airport as bodies begin to arrive back in Russia. Mokhtar Awad, an analyst with the Center for American Progress, tells the Guardian that the Islamic State’s claim of responsibility is quite vague. “It doesn’t state how they were able to ‘down’ the plane allegedly. Even the most sophisticated of portable surface-to-air missiles cannot reach that high an altitude and are only a threat during periods of take-off or landing, but the plane had already climbed to its target altitude (from what we know thus far) when it began to likely experience technical failures. The local affiliate, Wilayat Sinai, has been under some pressure over the past few months and may have jumped the gun on taking credit. Although there isn’t a precedent for such a spectacular lie about something they claim to have done, Islamic State itself has recently been embellishing more and more. For instance it claimed that the recent prison raid by Kurdish and US special forces were a total failure, when in fact video evidence surfaced showed them freeing the hostages. So this may be an instance of the rooster taking credit for the dawn.” Russian aviation regulator Rosaviatsia said it has not yet found any reason to blame the crash of the Russian airliner in Egypt on a technical failure, an error by the crew or external actions, RIA Novosti reports. Until there is reliable evidence about the circumstances of what happened, there is no sense in putting forward and discussing any versions. The Guardian’s reporter in Cairo Jahd Khalil analyses the burgeoning relationship between Russia and Egypt. Russians make up 19.7% of tourist arrivals to Egypt, the largest of any single country and 1.7 million were forecast to arrive in 2015 alone. The Egyptian government has cancelled visa costs for Russian tourists to encourage more visitors, and there is also a currency deal between Russia and Egypt being discussed. Since President Sisi took power, relations between Russia and Egypt have grown closer and been lauded in Egyptian press. Biltaeral agreements included developing nuclear power in Egypt and a $3.5 billion arms deal, as Egypt seeks to diversify its arms suppliers beyond the United States. Egypt also welcomed Russia’s latest intervention in Syria to support even as its Gulf allies, which have kept the Egyptian economy afloat with aid, vehemently opposed the Russian intervention. Russia’s transport minister Maksim Sokolov has said that the claim Islamic State militants brought down the plane “can’t be considered accurate”. Now in various media there is assorted information that the Russian [plane]... was supposedly shot down by an anti-aircraft missile, fired by terrorists. This information can’t be considered accurate. Shadi Bushra, reporting for the Guardian in Cairo, has also spoken to Mohamed Samir, Egypt’s army spokesman, who also refuted the claim. They can put out whatever statements they want but there is no proof at this point that terrorists were responsible for this plane crash. We will know the true reasons when the civil aviation authority in coordination with Russian authorities completes its investigation. But the army sees no authenticity to their claims or their video. Egypt’s prosecutor general has agreed to allow a Russian government agency to participate in investigating what caused the Russian passenger plane to crash, according to state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram. The North Sinai prosecution office has reportedly summoned air and ground traffic control officials for questioning over the incident, and ordered a technical team from the Civil Aviation Ministry to analyse the contents of the plane’s black box. Meanwhile, Russian investigators are searching the Moscow offices of Metrojet, the company that chartered the plane. The Investigative Committee is questioning both Metrojet employees and also the St Petersburg-based Brisco tour agency that had contracted for the flight from the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to St Petersburg, said spokesman Vladimir Markin. This is the statement from a group claiming to be speaking on behalf of Islamic State, posted on their affiliate site, translated by our correspondent in Cairo, Jahd Khalil. It offers no evidence that the group brought down the plane, apart from their word. Breaking: Downing of Russian airplane, killing of more than 220 Russian crusaders on board. Soldiers of the Caliphate were able to bring down a Russian plane above Sinai Province with at least 220 Russian crusaders aboard. They were all killed, praise be to God. O Russians, you and your allies take note that you are not safe in Muslims lands or their skies. The killing of dozens daily in Syria with bombs from your planes will bring woe to you. Just as you are killing others, you too will be killed, God willing. Many experts have expressed scepticism that groups operating in Sinai have the capacity to bring down an airline from the height it was travelling. A militant group affiliated to Islamic State in Egypt has claimed responsibility for bringing down the Russian passenger plane as it flew through Sinai peninsula on Saturday. The claim was circulated by supporters on Twitter and also published on the Aamaq news website, which has previosuly been used on a semi-official basis by Islamic State to circulate propaganda. There is no confirmation from any other sources that the plane crashed as a result of terrorist activity - and Egyptian officials were quick to rule that out as a cause of the crash earlier this morning. A report in July by military expert IHS Janes said Islamic State affiliate group Wilayat Sinai had propaganda videos in which militants are seen with a type of man-portable air defence systems (SA-18 Igla MANPADS), which can reach about 10,000 feet. The airliner was said to be travelling at least 31,000 feet, before it made a steep descent as it crashed. Russia’s Investigative Committee said on Saturday it was checking fuel samples from the airliner’s last refuelling stop, in the Russian city of Samara, news agency RIA Novosti reported. Spokesman Vladimir Markin said investigators are questioning people who were involved in preparing the aircraft and its crew and are carrying out searches at Moscow’s Domodedovo airport where the airline that operated the plane is based. Passengers at St Petersburg airport on Saturday morning who had been due to fly out to Egypt on holiday with Moscow-based tour operator Brisco, have said their plane has failed to show up. “Nobody came out to talk to us yet, we don’t know what plane we’ll be on,” a passenger called Anzhelika told the Rossiya-24 channel. “If it’s Kogalymavia, we don’t want to fly.” No representative of the airline could be found at the airport and nobody at the company was answering the phones, AFP reported. An initial examination of the crash site does show the Russian passenger plane crashed in Egypt’s Sinai peninsula due to a technical fault, security sources in North Sinai have told Reuters. About 150 bodies has so far been found, within roughly a three mile radius from the crashed aircraft. The plane, he said, landed in a “vertical fashion” and had caught fire. Safety violations were identified during the last routine inspection of the Kogalymavia airline, which operated the crashed jets, according to Russian state transport regulator Rostransnadzor. But after the March 2014 inspection, the airline successfully remedied the breaches, within the deadlines it had been set, the Interfax news agency reported. The Guardian’s Middle East editor Ian Black has forwarded this statement from the office of Egypt’s President Sisi, saying he has been receiving regular updates as investigators assess the cause of the crash. The Presidency of the Arab Republic of Egypt offers its sincere condolences to the leadership, government and people of Russia as well as the families of the victims of the Russian plane crash that took place near Al-Hasana City in Sinai. President Abdel Fattah El Sisi is following developments and is in contact with Prime Minister Sherif Ismail and other senior officials, who have headed to the crash site. The President instructed the investigation committee, formed by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, to swiftly carry out its mission and identify the reasons that led to the accident. This is in addition to coordinating efforts with the relevant Russian authorities. The Presidency is closely following the situation with members of the crisis management team, headed by the prime minister and that includes the ministers of civil aviation, tourism, interior, social solidarity, health and population, local development, and representatives from the ministry of defence and foreign affairs. The Presidency receives regular reports on the latest developments. A friend of Viktoria Sevryukova, 24, who was on the Metrojet passenger list published by the Association of Tour Operators, has been speaking to the Guardian’s Alec Luhn. Sevryukova had posted Instagram photographs of herself relaxing on the beach with friends in Sharm el-Sheikh, as well as one departing from St Petersburg airport. Sevryukova’s friend Yevgenia Beryozina said that she felt “emptiness” and still couldn’t believe the news. “She was my best friend, she had waited for this trip like I don’t know what,” Beryozina said. “And now she’s gone. Just like that she’s gone.” Beryozina described Sevrukova as “positive, smart and sociable” and that “everything was just starting to work out” in her life. “It’s just not fair,” she said of the accident. The two had chatted online before Sevryukova left the Red Sea resort, and she had said she wanted to return there in the future, Beryozina said. Jahd Khalil, a reporter for the Guardian in Cairo, reports that Egypt’s prime minister and a group of other ministers arrived at an airport in Suez to visit the scene of the crash, along with the commander of the country’s airforce. Medical teams are now in the process of identifying all of the bodies from the crash. Family members of Russian passengers believed to be on board a plane that crashed in Egypt’s Sinai peninsula can be seen arriving Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg in this video to receive the latest news. Friends and relatives of those on the Metrojet flight are being directed to a nearby airport hotel, and Russian authorities said counsellors are in attendance. Yulia Zaitseva said her friends, a newlywed couple named Elena Rodina and Alexqander Krotov, both aged 33, were on the flight. Her friend “really wanted to go to Egypt, though I told her ‘why the hell do you want to go to Egypt?’” Zaitseva told AP. “We were friends for 20 years. She was a very good friend who was ready to give everything to other people. “To lose such a friend is like having your hand cut off.” She said Rodina’s parents feel “like their lives are over.” Airbus said the A321-200 that crashed on Saturday was 18 years old and had been operated by the Russian airline since 2012. It had made almost 21,000 flights and accrued about 56,000 flight hours. The plane manufacturer said it would provide full technical assistance to the authorities investigating the crash. US officials have offered their condolences to Russia and the families of the crash victims. Secretary of State John Kerry said: We don’t know any details about it, but obviously the initial reports represent tremendous tragedy, loss, and we extend our condolences to the families and all those concerned. He was speaking during a visit to the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan. AFP reports that 15 bodies have been transferred to a morgue in Cairo. Medical and security sources have now also told the Reuters news agency that there are no survivors of the crash. Kogalymavia, the airline whose plane has crashed today in Egypt, which is also known as Metrojet, said there were “no grounds” to blame the incident on human error, Russian news agency Ria reports. The Russian passenger plane was carrying 214 Russian passengers and three Ukrainians, the Egyptian cabinet has said in a statement. Out of the total 217 passengers, 138 were women, 62 men and 17 were children. Egypt’s prime minister Sharif Ismail is en route to the scene of the wreckage in the al-Hasanah area of Sinai. Mahlab has been in contact with the Russian ambassador this morning and extended his condolences, his office said. “It is premature to decide the reasons of the crash and that the whole issue is now under investigation to clarify its reasons,” the cabinet office’s statement. • This section was amended on 2 November 2015 to correct the name of the Egyptian prime minister Russia’s prime minister Dmitry Medvedev says he is “deeply shocked”. Egyptian officials have told Associated Press there are no survivors from crash of Russian airliner in Sinai. Security services at the scene had previously told Reuters they believed they could hear voices from inside the wreckage. Ambulances have been sent to the plane’s location, but it now appears hopes of any survivors may have been dashed. The Guardian’s Alec Luhn in Moscow has the latest: Crew members of the crashed airliner raised the issue of possible engine faults several times to airport technicians in Sharm el-Sheikh, a source at the airport has alleged in an interview with Russian news agency RIA Novosti. “This aircraft appealed to the technical service in connection with engine start failure several times over the past week before this happened,” the source said. In Moscow MP Vladimir Gutenev has told state news agency TASS he will seek to ban the use of planes that are more than 15 years old. The Airbus A321-231 involved in the crash entered service in 1997 and has been operated by Kogalymavia, the company also known as Metrojet, for the past four years. Previously it flew for Libyan company Middle East Airlines, Turkish company Onur Air, Saudi Arabian Airlines and Syrian company Cham Wings Airlines. Kogalymavia began as a small regional airline in Russia in 1993, but now its 10 planes mainly fly to Egypt. Its planes have been involved in accidents before, including a Tu-154 that caught fire on the runway in Surgut, killing three and injuring 43. The head of Egypt’s civil aviation authority Mahmud al-Zinati has told AFP there are “many dead”. He said 17 children were among the casualties, tallied by rescue workers on the ground. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti has also reported that the bodies of all 17 children who were on the flight have been found. President Vladimir Putin has declared a day of mourning for the victims of the crash, the Kremlin said in a statement. November 1 is declared a day of mourning in Russia for those killed in plane crash, it said. The president signed a decree “declaring a day of mourning in connection with the plane crash which occurred in the Arab Republic of Egypt.” Egyptian authorities have located the black boxes containing flight data of the Russian passenger plane that crashed in the country’s Sinai peninsula, security sources have told Reuters. A black box records the recent history of sounds in the cockpit, including conversations between pilots, and is intended to give an accurate picture of what happened immediately before any crash or incident, to assist investigators. The Guardian’s Alec Luhn reports from Moscow: Russia’s investigative committee is flying a group of investigators and criminologists with experience working air crashes to the crash site in Egypt, spokesman Vladimir Markin said in a statement. The investigative committee has opened a criminal case for “violating rules of flying and preparation”. Those on the flight were insured by the company Ingosstrakh, which will pay about 2 million roubles (£20,000) per passenger, general director Ilya Solomatin told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper. According to the Russian Association of Tour Operators, the flight was piloted by captain Valery Nemov and second pilot Sergei Trukhachyov. They have also published a full passenger manifest. Reuters have more from a security officer at the scene, who had told the agency by telephone that search and rescue teams heard voices in a section of the plane. “I now see a tragic scene. A lot of dead on the ground and many who died whilst strapped to their seats,” the officer, who requested anonymity, said. “The plane split into two, a small part on the tail end that burned and a larger part that crashed into a rock. We have extracted at least 100 bodies and the rest are still inside.” The website Flight radar has published a looping playback of the route of the plane until it lost contact over Sinai. Mike Vivian, former head of flight operations for the Civil Aviation Authority, has been speaking on Sky News, saying authorities will almost certainly be investigating if hostile activity is to blame, even if they do not say so publicly. I would be very surprised if weather was a factor. These are good conditions, that’s why people go down there on holiday of course. I don’t think it’s weather. I would be surprised if it was mechanical fault, these aircraft have a excellent safety record. And equally I’d be very surprised if the pilot [error] influenced it because if it crashed after 23 minutes it was almost certainly up at cruising altitude. So it leaves you with very few options. I will say this, although publically hostile actions have been discounted, I am absolutely certain that will be one of focuses of the investigation on the ground, so I don’t think you can rule it out, but I’m not saying you can rule it in. A passenger at Saint Petersburg’s Pulkovo airport, has been speaking to AFP. Here’s their report. “I am meeting my parents,” said 25-year-old Ella Smirnova, a tall young woman seemingly in shock. “I spoke to them last on the phone when they were already on the plane, and then I heard the news.” “I will keep hoping until the end that they are alive, but perhaps I will never see them again.” Egyptian state news agency MENA news agency reports the “casualties” are being transferred to nearby hospitals. It gives no indication of the condition of the casualties, and we still have no official word that there are survivors of the crash. Friends and families of those on board the plane have been speaking to Russian media. Olga Ofitserova, whose friend Nadya Laisheva was reportedly on board, told Gazeta.ru: “We’re all in shock. She’s so young.” Distraught relatives are arriving at St Petersberg international airport looking for news of the flight, and are reportedly being taken by bus to a crisis centre. The Guardian’s Alec Luhn writes from Moscow: Russian president Vladimir Putin expressed his deepest condolences to the relatives of those who died on the flight and ordered PM Dmitry Medvedev to create a special commission in connection with the crash, the Kremlin press service said. He also ordered the head of the emergencies ministry Vladimir Puchkov to send his service’s planes to work at the crash site as soon as possible. Medvedev ordered transport ministry head Maxim Sokolov to fly to Cairo. Children’s ombudsman Pavel Astakhov wrote on Instagram that 17 children were on the flight, saying his “worst fears” are confirmed. State news agency TASS later reported that 17 children had been on board aged 2 to 17. The emergencies ministry has opened a hotline for relatives of victims and sent psychologists to St. Petersburg’s Pulkovo airport, where the plane had been headed, to provide help to relatives and others who had gathered there. The Russian holiday tour operator Brisco had booked the flight, although clients of other tour companies had also been on board, state tourism agency spokeswoman Irina Tyurina told news agency Interfax. Many Russians prefer all-inclusive package tours in which lodging, food and flights are all organised by the tour operator. Relatives have begun arriving at Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg and are being directed to a crisis centre, according to local reporters. Valery Nechay, a reporter for Moscow radio, said media have been taken to a separate section of the airport. Russia’s civil air agency is expected to have a news conference shortly at a hotel adjacent to the airport. An Egyptian security officer has told Reuters he could hear the voices of trapped passengers from a section of the crashed Russian plane. The plane reportedly split into two parts. “There is another section of the plane with passengers inside that the rescue team is still trying to enter and we hope to find survivors, especially after hearing pained voices of people inside,” the anonymous officer told the news agency. Egypt’s health ministry has dispatched 45 ambulances to the scene to “evacuate the dead and wounded” which could indicate possible survivors, though this remains unconfirmed. The Israeli military has been assisting Egypt in the aerial search for the plane, and offered further assistance to its neighbouring, according to Israeli Defence Force spokesman Peter Lerner. Israel’s border with neighbouring Egypt runs along the Sinai. The two countries signed a peace accord in 1979. The Guardian’s Alec Luhn writes from Moscow: The Russian embassy in Egypt has said all those on board were Russians, Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper reported. The airplane was put into service 18 years ago. Aging planes have been involved in previous Russian air tragedies, such as a 2011 crash in Petrozavodsk that killed 47. Smaller Russian carriers often buy or lease older planes. The Russian authorities have been attempting to reduce the number of small air carriers to improve safety in recent years. Russia had the most air crash casualties of any country in 2011 due to several high-profile crashes, including one that killed a large part of the Yaroslavl Lokomotiv hockey team. Egyptian media are reporting that the Russian plane crashed due to “technical failure”. Ayman Al-Mokadem, the Egyptian pilot appointed to invetigate the cause of the crash, told Ahram Online that the Metrojet pilot had made contact with aviation authorities and asked to land at the nearest airport. He speculated that the plane had been attempting an emergency landing at Al-Arish’s airport in North Sinai. Egyptian authorities have been very quick to stress that terrorism is not the cause of the crash, but we have yet to get independent confirmation that technical failure was behind the incident. There were several other planes in the airspace in Sinai peninsula, according to Flight Radar. Security officials have been telling local media that they do not believe there is any indication that the plane was shot down by Islamist militants, whom the state has been battling in central Sinai for several years. This Metrojet plane is believed to be the one which has crashed in Sinai - the Airbus A321 with a tail number of EI-ETJ. The picture shows the plane on the airstrip of Domodedovo International Airport on October 20th - so it’s not from today’s incident. “Military planes have discovered the wreckage of the plane,” a statement said, confirming it was located in the mountainous Hassana area, south of Arish, in central Sinai. The plane was at an altitude of 31,000 feet when it vanished from radar screens, the ministry said in a statement to Egypt’s MENA news agency. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has posted on her Facebook wall that the Russian embassy in Egypt is monitoring the situation. “As soon as further information will be received, it would be provided to the media,” she writes. Seventeen children were among the passengers on the Russian jet, Russia’s RIA news agency quoted a source in the Russian aviation authority as saying. Also on board were 200 adult passengers and 7 crew members. Two flight tracking websites, Plane Finder and Flight Radar, have been looking at the flight data to track the moment of the crash. Good morning, we’re following the latest developments after a Russian passenger plane crashed in Egypt’s Sinai peninsula. Here are the facts we have so far: The flight of the Kogalymavia airline, also known as Metrojet, set off from the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, destined for St Petersburg, and is now confirmed to have crashed in central Sinai with all onboard feared dead. The plane had 217 passengers and seven crew onboard and lost contact just 23 minutes into the flight when it was travelling at 21,000 feet. The crash site was found on Saturday morning by an Egyptian search and rescue team in southern Arish. A security officer has told Reuters the plane was “completely destroyed with all on board likely to have died”. There were no indications the plane was shot down, Egyptian security sources told Reuters. Northern Sinai is home to groups of Islamist militants, many affiliated to Islamic State. A statement from the prime minister’s office said Sherif Ismail had formed a cabinet-level crisis committee to deal with the crash. Data from Flight Radar showed the aircraft had made a steep descent at a rate of 6,000 feet per minute shortly before signal was lost. Russia’s aviation authority, Rosaviatsiya, said the flight had left at 03:51 GMT and was due into St Petersburg’s Pulkovo airport at 12:10 GMT, but it had failed to make scheduled contact with Cyprus air traffic control in Larnaca and disappeared from the radar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2014/jan/31/trident-nuclear-submarine-fleet-reduced-royal-united-services-institute","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-31T00:00:01Z","webTitle":"Trident nuclear submarine fleet could be reduced without danger, says analyst","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/trident-nuclear-submarine-fleet-reduced-royal-united-services-institute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/trident-nuclear-submarine-fleet-reduced-royal-united-services-institute","fields":{"headline":"Trident nuclear submarine fleet could be reduced without danger, says analyst","bodyText":"Britain could achieve billions of pounds in savings by breaking with tradition to cut its Trident nuclear submarine fleet from four to three, according to a report published on Friday by one of the country's leading military think-tanks. For the past 45 years, the accepted view in the British military has been that the minimum number of nuclear submarines needed to act as a credible deterrent is four: one at sea, one being refitted, one engaged in training and one in reserve. But Hugh Chalmers, in a 24-page report, argues that Britain could maintain a credible deterrent with just three submarines. A government decision is to be made within the next few years about whether to replace Britain's ageing nuclear submarine fleet at an estimated cost of £20 billion, rising to about £80 billion over their lifetime. The run-up to the decision will be marked by a debate about whether Britain needs a nuclear option at all. Both the government and Labour are committed to replacing the existing four-submarine fleet but even within the military there are senior voices arguing that at least some of the money might be better channelled towards a fast-reaction conventional force. Dropping from four submarines to three offers a compromise that would see Britain remain a nuclear power while cutting back on the massive budget. The US, France and Russia all have a \"continuously at sea\" policy. Chalmers, a research analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, argues that it may not be necessary to have at least one submarine continuously at sea in order to create uncertainty in a potential aggressor. \"Thus while continuous patrolling probably enhances the credibility of the UK's nuclear forces, it does not embody it. It is not immediately apparent if Russia, China or, indeed, any other state would feel any less threatened by the UK's nuclear forces were they occasionally unavailable,\" Chalmers says. In the report, A Disturbance In The Force: debating continuous at-sea deterrence, he says: \"While many of the UK's allies would be taken aback by such a change in its nuclear posture, with proper presentation and integration into Nato's nuclear structures it could still make a useful and reassuring contribution …\" The Liberal Democrats argue that, post-cold war, a four-submarine nuclear fleet is no longer necessary, prompting defence secretary Philip Hammond to accuse them of naivety. Chalmers argues that a reduced fleet could still make a potential adversary think twice. \"If it were seen to be capable of deploying its nuclear forces in a crisis, the very existence of such a force could have the effect of dissuading a potentially hostile state from threatening or blackmailing the UK and its allies,\" Chalmers says. The fleet could cancel sustained patrols during periods of lower tension. \"An inactive fleet would be vulnerable to a no-notice strike, and could neither protect itself against nor respond to an attack under these circumstances. However, such an attack seems highly unlikely without prior indication or provocation, both of which would provide the UK with an opportunity to calibrate the readiness of its forces,\" he says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/sep/12/county-councils-nuclear-waste-dump-sites","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-12T19:04:24Z","webTitle":"County councils sidelined from nuclear waste dump site decisions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/12/county-councils-nuclear-waste-dump-sites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/sep/12/county-councils-nuclear-waste-dump-sites","fields":{"headline":"County councils sidelined from nuclear waste dump site decisions","bodyText":"The government has been accused of \"astonishingly undemocratic\" behaviour after it moved to cut out county councils from deciding the site of a national nuclear waste dump. The stinging criticism came from the leaders of Cumbria county council, who have been sidelined months after scuppering ministers' plans by voting against a £12bn high-level waste repository near the Sellafield nuclear complex. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has published a policy document that makes clear the lead authority in the decision-making process for locating a waste dump – or geological disposal facility (GDF) – is now the district council. A site near Sellafield was given the green light last time by Copeland and Allerdale borough councils before being voted down by the cabinet of the county council in a major setback for the government last January. Stuart Young, a Labour councillor and current leader of Cumbria county council, said: \"We are very concerned that we as the waste and strategic planning authority have no real say in the final decision on a GDF. It looks like the government did not like the [negative] result of the last vote and has moved to exclude us from future decisions.\" Eddie Martin, a Conservative who led the county council when it took the decision against a repository, said the government's action was \"astonishingly undemocratic\". He added: \"David Cameron talks about the big society and localism but abandons them when they do not suit him. This [ours] was a decision taken after much thought, hundreds of hours of work and visits to Canada and Sweden.\" But Baroness Verma, an energy minister, insisted local democracy is being strengthened rather than diluted with county councils still playing a \"really important role\" in the consultation and planning processes. She added: \"We have listened very carefully to local people and we are making sure they can make an informed choice. No one is being left out.\" Nuclear experts say it could take 15 years to select a site and a further 15 years to build a repository. There is still much debate about whether Cumbria or any other part of the UK has the geology to hold the waste safely for the hundreds of years necessary. The consultation period on the policy document will run for three months, with plans to relaunch a proper site selection process next year. The new policy includes promises for more information to be given to local communities early on, an ongoing right to withdraw from the process at any stage and a clear opportunity for local people to have their views made known. The only other part of the country to see a debate on whether to consider hosting a repository needed to house decades of Britain's waste from nuclear power stations was the Isle of Sheppey. The proposal was quickly dropped amid a welter of public opposition. Governments of all complexions have generally accepted it would be wrong to proceed with a new generation of atomic power stations before a home has been found for past waste. Baroness Verma indicated that it would still be possible to give the go-ahead to an operator to build a new power plant such as one at Hinkley Point in Somerset before the repository plan proceeded, because new plants would have to deal with their own waste. But Emma Gibson from Greenpeace said: \"The launch of this consultation shows the government still has no plan to deal with nuclear waste, which is a pre-requisite for building any new nuclear power stations.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/nov/02/rapid-carbon-emission-cuts-severe-impact-climate-change-ipcc-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-02T13:23:35Z","webTitle":"IPCC: rapid carbon emission cuts vital to stop severe impact of climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/02/rapid-carbon-emission-cuts-severe-impact-climate-change-ipcc-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/nov/02/rapid-carbon-emission-cuts-severe-impact-climate-change-ipcc-report","fields":{"headline":"IPCC: rapid carbon emission cuts vital to stop severe impact of climate change","bodyText":"Climate change is set to inflict “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” on people and the natural world unless carbon emissions are cut sharply and rapidly, according to the most important assessment of global warming yet published. The stark report states that climate change has already increased the risk of severe heatwaves and other extreme weather and warns of worse to come, including food shortages and violent conflicts. But it also found that ways to avoid dangerous global warming are both available and affordable. “Science has spoken. There is no ambiguity in the message,” said the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, attending what he described as the “historic” report launch. “Leaders must act. Time is not on our side.” He said that quick, decisive action would build a better and sustainable future, while inaction would be costly. Ban added a message to investors, such as pension fund managers: “Please reduce your investments in the coal- and fossil fuel-based economy and [move] to renewable energy.” The report, released in Copenhagen on Sunday by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is the work of thousands of scientists and was agreed after negotiations by the world’s governments. It is the first IPCC report since 2007 to bring together all aspects of tackling climate change and for the first time states: that it is economically affordable; that carbon emissions will ultimately have to fall to zero; and that global poverty can only be reduced by halting global warming. The report also makes clear that carbon emissions, mainly from burning coal, oil and gas, are currently rising to record levels, not falling. The report comes at a critical time for international action on climate change, with the deadline for a global deal just over a year away. In September, 120 national leaders met at the UN in New York to address climate change, while hundreds of thousands of marchers around the world demanded action. “We have the means to limit climate change,” said Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the IPCC. “The solutions are many and allow for continued economic and human development. All we need is the will to change.” Lord Nicholas Stern, a professor at the London School of Economics and the author of an influential earlier study, said the new IPCC report was the “most important assessment of climate change ever prepared” and that it made plain that “further delays in tackling climate change would be dangerous and profoundly irrational”. “The reality of climate change is undeniable, and cannot be simply wished away by politicians who lack the courage to confront the scientific evidence,” he said, adding that the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people were at risk. Ed Davey, the UK energy and climate change secretary, said: “This is the most comprehensive and robust assessment ever produced. It sends a clear message: we must act on climate change now. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, said: “This is another canary in the coal mine. We can’t prevent a large scale disaster if we don’t heed this kind of hard science.” Bill McKibben, a high-profile climate campaigner with 350.org, said: “For scientists, conservative by nature, to use ‘serious, pervasive, and irreversible’ to describe the effects of climate falls just short of announcing that climate change will produce a zombie apocalypse plus random beheadings plus Ebola.” Breaking the power of the fossil fuel industry would not be easy, McKibben said. “But, thanks to the IPCC, no one will ever be able to say they weren’t warned.” The new overarching IPCC report builds on previous reports on the science, impacts and solutions for climate change. It concludes that global warming is “unequivocal”, that humanity’s role in causing it is “clear” and that many effects will last for hundreds to thousands of years even if the planet’s rising temperature is halted. In terms of impacts, such as heatwaves and extreme rain storms causing floods, the report concludes that the effects are already being felt: “In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans.” Droughts, coastal storm surges from the rising oceans and wildlife extinctions on land and in the seas will all worsen unless emissions are cut, the report states. This will have knock-on effects, according to the IPCC: “Climate change is projected to undermine food security.” The report also found the risk of wars could increase: “Climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflicts by amplifying well-documented drivers of these conflicts such as poverty and economic shocks.” Two-thirds of all the emissions permissible if dangerous climate change is to be avoided have already been pumped into the atmosphere, the IPPC found. The lowest cost route to stopping dangerous warming would be for emissions to peak by 2020 – an extremely challenging goal – and then fall to zero later this century. The report calculates that to prevent dangerous climate change, investment in low-carbon electricity and energy efficiency will have to rise by several hundred billion dollars a year before 2030. But it also found that delaying significant emission cuts to 2030 puts up the cost of reducing carbon dioxide by almost 50%, partly because dirty power stations would have to be closed early. “If you wait, you also have to do more difficult and expensive things,” said Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London and an IPCC working group vice-chair. Tackling climate change need only trim economic growth rates by a tiny fraction, the IPCC states, and may actually improve growth by providing other benefits, such as cutting health-damaging air pollution. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) – the nascent technology which aims to bury CO2 underground – is deemed extremely important by the IPPC. It estimates that the cost of the big emissions cuts required would more than double without CCS. Pachauri said: “With CCS it is entirely possible for fossil fuels to continue to be used on a large scale.” The focus on CCS is not because the technology has advanced a great deal in recent years, said Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, a professor at the Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium and vice-chair of the IPCC, but because emissions have continued to increase so quickly. “We have emitted so much more, so we have to clean up more later”, he said. Linking CCS to the burning of wood and other plant fuels would reduce atmospheric CO2 levels because the carbon they contain is sucked from the air as they grow. But van Ypersele said the IPCC report also states “very honestly and fairly” that there are risks to this approach, such as conflicts with food security. In contrast to the importance the IPCC gives to CCS, abandoning nuclear power or deploying only limited wind or solar power increases the cost of emission cuts by just 6-7%. The report also states that behavioural changes, such as dietary changes that could involve eating less meat, can have a role in cutting emissions. As part of setting out how the world’s nations can cut emissions effectively, the IPCC report gives prominence to ethical considerations. “[Carbon emission cuts] and adaptation raise issues of equity, justice, and fairness,” says the report. “The evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective [international] cooperation.” These issues are central to the global climate change negotiations and their inclusion in the report was welcomed by campaigners, as was the statement that adapting countries and coastlines to cope with global warming cannot by itself avert serious impacts. “Rich governments must stop making empty promises and come up with the cash so the poorest do not have to foot the bill for the lifestyles of the wealthy,” said Harjeet Singh, from ActionAid. The statement that carbon emissions must fall to zero was “gamechanging”, according to Kaisa Kosonen, from Greenpeace. “We can still limit warming to 2C, or even 1.5C or less even, [but] we need to phase out emissions,” she said. Unlike CCS, which is yet to be proven commercially, she said renewable energy was falling rapidly in cost. Sam Smith, from WWF, said: “The big change in this report is that it shows fighting climate change is not going to cripple economies and that it is essential to bringing people out of poverty. What is needed now is concerted political action.” The rapid response of politicians to the recent global financial crisis showed, according to Smith, that “they could act quickly and at scale if they are sufficiently motivated”. Michel Jarraud, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organisation, said the much greater certainty expressed in the new IPCC report would give international climate talks a better chance than those which failed in 2009. “Ignorance can no longer be an excuse for no action,” he said. Observers played down the moves made by some countries with large fossil fuel reserves to weaken the language of the draft IPCC report written by scientists and seen by the Guardian, saying the final report was conservative but strong. However, the statement that “climate change is expected to lead to increases in ill-health in many regions, including greater likelihood of death” was deleted in the final report, along with criticism that politicians sometimes “engage in short-term thinking and are biased toward the status quo”. • This article was amended on 6 November 2014 to remove a picture of Singapore because the caption said: “Singapore shrouded by a haze as carbon emissions soar”.

But the property pictures on portals such as Rightmove and Zoopla suggest that too many agents and vendors do not bother. The blog TerribleRealEstateAgentPhotos.com features particularly eye-catching examples, such as creepy Victorian dolls, swastika-themed bathroom decor and a semi-naked elderly man out windsurfing. But many photos let sellers down in a more mundane way. This £190,000 flat in Folkestone may well benefit from large rooms with high ceilings, but you have to take that on trust because there are no interior shots. With this £174,950 two-bedroom cottage in Sedbergh, Cumbria, it's a case of guess which property in the village is actually for sale. Perhaps agents think they can get away with a few shoddy snapshots in today's market, where desperate buyers will pay over the odds for anything with a roof, especially in London and the south-east. But the current boom won't last forever, and in parts of the north in particular, it has barely got started. Given that in today's crazy property market you may be hoping to get a buyer to fork out hundreds of thousands of pounds for your pad, it makes good sense to present it nicely. \"We have more than 1m properties advertised on our site, and even after buyers filter their searches by price band and location, they may still be faced with a string of similar-looking properties,\" says Andy Hatoum, co-founder of property search engine Placebuzz.com. \"You need to make yours stand out, and high-quality photography is essential.\" When civil servant Helen O'Shea, 58, and her husband Peter, 59, who works for the International Cricket Council, marketed their home in Shepperton, Surrey, on 26 June, they were determined to present it at its best. They sold their home through online estate agent Tepilo.com, which gives buyers the option of having professional photographs taken for a fee of £99 plus VAT. Helen is convinced that using a professional photographer attracted more buyer interest. \"Everybody who came to view the house said that when they saw our home online, they had to go and see it. By 5 July we had accepted an offer for the full asking price of £765,000.\" If you're unhappy with the photos taken by your agent, you have every right to ask them to retake the shots, says James Hall, director of London estate agent Fishneedwater.com. \"If your property has a unique feature that you feel needs expert attention, then discuss with your agent. Alternatively, you can organise your own photography.\" However, Halls warns that hiring a professional photographer could cost between £300 and £1,000 plus VAT, and buyers should not expect their estate agents to reduce their fee accordingly. High street estate agents are desperately trying to cut their overheads to compete with cheaper online rivals, and photography is an easy target, says award-winning photographer Paul Clarke, who despairs at some of the amateurish photos he sees posted online. \"Many agents no longer use professionals, they just send somebody from the office with an SLR camera, or sometimes even a smartphone. There is a feeling that good pictures don't matter, that this is only the internet, it isn't a six-page glossy brochure. But that's wrong.\" Clarke recently launched his Fix Your Pix service aimed at homeowners marketing their homes through online estate agents, who can email him their photographs to be professionally retouched for £10 per shot plus VAT, far cheaper than organising your own shoot. Clarke says professional property shots can be misleading, because photographers use extreme wide-angle lenses to make rooms look far bigger than they really are. \"I don't have any qualms about retouching photos to make them look more attractive, but I wouldn't use technology to reshape a room or hide cracks in the walls. Basic retouching is fine, misrepresentation isn't.\" Until last year, the Property Misdescriptions Act protected buyers from the risks around doctored photos. This was repealed last year, and replaced by the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. The regulations warn that photographs can be misleading, and state that: \"Do not doctor photos or use extreme lenses. If you take a photo of the view from a bedroom window, but cannot include the rubbish dump, don't say 'panoramic views' or 'unspoilt countryside'.\" Homeowners need to take care with property photographs to avoid breaching the rules, says Mark Hayward, managing director at the National Association of Estate Agents. \"Images must be representative of the property exactly as it is at the time of sale, without omitting aspects that may not be aesthetically pleasing.\" Estate agents who breach the act may face criminal charges under the CPR, he says. \"Agents must pay attention to what they omit about a property when marketing it for sale, as well as what they actually say. They must ensure that any relevant facts, matters and materials that would enable a buyer to make an informed decision are brought to their attention. This includes representative photographs of the property.\" On 1 August, the property ombudsman launched new codes of practice for both sales and letting agents, who must take all reasonable steps to ensure that statements about a property, include pictures, are accurate and are not misleading. Christopher Hamer, the ombudsman, says: \"Modern technology enables agents to help homeowners present their property in the best possible light. However, complaints can arise from buyers who feel misled if an agent has, for example, manipulated photographs to enhance or omit something that has misled the consumer. \"When reviewing complaints, I will look for evidence that the consumer has taken a different transactional decision as a direct result of the agent's actions. Clear examples of inappropriately manipulated photographs include the removal of closely located factories, motorways, pubs or similar facilities.\" He admits there are \"grey areas\" when manipulating photos. \"For example, where a north facing room is brightened giving the appearance it receives sunlight, or where an agent might change the colour of internal décor to make the photos more aesthetically pleasing.\" Hamer says buyers can feel rightly aggrieved if they have travelled some distance to view a property where the images differ greatly from the reality. If you're unhappy, you should first submit your complaint to the estate agent's in-house complaints procedure. If that doesn't resolve things, you can complain to the ombudsman. There is still plenty vendors can do to make sure their property stands out in the online \"beauty parade\", says John Durrant, a former estate agent turned professional photographer, whose website www.doctor-photo.co.uk will improve photographs of your home for just £3 a shot. \"Nobody should want a battleship-grey sky in their photograph. Blue sky makes properties look more cheerful and attractive. Nobody wants to display the neighbours bins either, and these can be digitally removed.\" Durrant draws a line between doctoring temporary and permanent features. \"I think it is acceptable to, say, digitally remove a van, builder's skip or washing lines, but I wouldn't airbrush permanent features such as a road sign or electricity pylon.\" That doesn't stop photographers from angling their camera so that it excludes, say, the minor fact of a nuclear power station in the backyard, as the agent advertising this £247,000 bungalow in Dungeness notoriously did. What photographers leave out is as telling as what they include, says Tracy Kellett, managing director of BDI Homefinders. \"Alarm bells ring when there's no shot of the front of the house, or it's 17 images along, after a close-up of the bathroom taps. This definitely tells me the property falls into the ugly camp.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2014/jan/15/global-investment-clean-energy-falls","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-15T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"Global investment in clean energy falls for second year running","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/15/global-investment-clean-energy-falls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jan/15/global-investment-clean-energy-falls","fields":{"headline":"Global investment in clean energy falls for second year running","bodyText":"Global investment in clean energy fell for the second year in a row to $254bn last year, with green investment in Europe crashing by 41%, new figures showed on Wednesday. The drop casts a pall over a high-profile investor summit at the United Nations on Wednesday. The summit, organised by the Ceres investor network, was supposed to build momentum for the shift to a clean energy economy – a transformation requiring global investment of some $1 trillion a year by 2030. But investment in clean energy headed downwards last year, according to the figures released at the summit by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). It was the second year of declining investment in clean energy from a record $318bn in 2011, the research showed. BNEF's founder, Michael Liebreich, said there were some bright spots in the decline. \"The top‐line figures don't tell the whole story,\" he said in a statement. He said the sharp fall in investment in Europe was partly the result of declining costs for solar panels, bringing down the costs of rooftop solar. Even with the lower figures for clean energy investment, global solar installations grew by 20% last year. Meanwhile, Liebreich said there was new investor interest in electric vehicles and renewable power projects. But with big economies such as Germany, Italy and France scaling back government support for new projects, clean energy investment fell from $98bn to $58bn in Europe, a drop of 41%. Germany saw the biggest decline, from $26.2bn in 2012 to $14.1bn last year – the lowest since 2006. Britain, in contrast, saw a relatively modest decline from $14.3bn to $13.1bn. Clean energy investment was even down in China – for the first time in decade – with a 3.8% drop. In America, investment in clean energy and technologies fell by 8.4% to $48.4bn, Bloomberg said. The biggest exception to the downward trend was Japan, where clean energy investment rose 55% to $35.4bn last year, as the country tried to replace its nuclear power plants. The new BNEF figures look set to add even more urgency to appeals for financial institutions to drastically step up investment in clean energy. The UN's climate chief, Christiana Figueres, this week urged global financial institutions to triple their investments in clean energy to reach the $1 trillion figure needed to avoid a climate catastrophe. Figueres planned to take her case directly to the financial institutions at the investor summit on Wednesday.

But the report studied only a small area of Scotland, including the most heavily populated areas between Glasgow and Edinbugh, and the Firth of Forth, and found that the recoverable amounts of gas and oil from the deposits were as yet unknown – as is still the case in England. The findings have stoked controversy over the heavily disputed future of oil and gas in the UK, if Scotland should choose independence in its referendum this autumn. Energy security is a key issue in the debate, with pro-independence campaigners claiming an energy-independent future for a Scotland outside the Union – using North Sea gas, oil and renewable energy resources such as wind and tides – while pro-unionists argue that the energy future of the country is closely bound-up with the rest of the UK. The Midland Valley of Scotland – the populous low-lying central region of Scotland that includes Glasgow and Edinburgh – has an estimated 80 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of shale gas below ground, according to the British Geological Survey in a report published on Tuesday, the third in a series of studies by the organisation to map shale gas and oil reserves across the UK. Crucially, however, the authors were not able to estimate how much of this will be recoverable. The broad estimate of the resource is much less than the 1,300 tcf posited to be in the Bowland shale in northern England. The UK uses 3tcf of gas each year. Shale gas and oil have become accessible in the last decade because of advances in the technology of hydraulic fracturing – fracking – that involves blasting dense shale rocks with a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals, in order to open up tiny fissures that release the microscopic bubbles of gas or oil trapped within. But the process has come under fire as it has been linked with water and air pollution in the US, and escapes of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The BGS findings give a small boost to efforts to develop shale gas resources in the UK, which ministers have backed because they say it will promote economic growth and energy security. The prime minister, David Cameron, has said the government is “going all out for shale” and is looking to change trespass laws to make it possible for fracking companies to drill under people’s homes without their permission. The Scotland survey also found a potential 6bn barrels of shale oil in the area covered, which compares with the 4.45bn best estimate of shale oil reserves in the Sussex Weald, which the BGS also surveyed recently. The Weald survey was seen as disappointing because it concluded “there is unlikely to be any shale-gas potential [in the area, which runs from Salisbury to Tunbridge Wells]”. Shale oil is viewed as a more difficult proposition than shale gas, because it is dirtier to extract and likely to involve much more disruption to the local population. Protests against drilling have delayed progress in Surrey and Lancashire, and further demonstrations are likely at any future sites. Michael Fallon, the Tory energy minister, emphasised the benefits of Scotland, England and the rest of the UK pooling fossil fuel resources in order to be able to access unconventional reserves more cheaply. Only the UK combined had the “broad shoulders” and “taxpayer commitment” to attract the investment in infrastructure needed to tap the resource, he said. “We are inter-dependent. We have a single energy market in the UK and we benefit from Scottish renewables, and when the wind does not blow Scotland benefits from nuclear [power] in England. It is a single inter-connected energy market and it works very well for consumers.” But the geologists cautioned that there was not enough data yet in Scotland to be sure of how much of the anticipated resource could be profitably extracted. There is much less data on the area in question – the first to be assessed for shale gas and oil in Scotland – than there has been in comparable areas in England, of which two have so far been surveyed. Wells will have to be drilled across the area in order to find out how much can be explored. The report also left out the potential of coal-bed methane, a different source of natural gas that can be extracted without the need for fracking – it occurs naturally in coal seams, causing explosions and loss of life where coal was exploited in previous decades – and that has been targeted by several companies as an easier alternative to shale gas fracking. Green groups seized on the BGS findings as evidence that Scotland would not enjoy a new industry on the scale of North Sea oil and gas, which have been a mainstay of the Scottish economy since the 1960s, and therefore should concentrate on the potential of clean technology such as wind. Lang Banks, director of WWF Scotland, said: “It’s clear that there’s not going to be a shale gas or oil bonanza in Scotland any time soon. While this study should change nothing about Scotland’s aim to decarbonise its power sector and go fully renewable, in the wider interests of tackling climate change, it’s time for Scottish ministers to commit to start leaving some fossil fuels, including shale gas, in the ground.” But Ken Cronin, chief executive of UKOOG, which represents the onshore oil and gas industry, welcomed the study, saying: “This report will give reassurance to investors who wish to explore for oil and gas onshore in Scotland and adds to the estimates of significant onshore resources which can help replace the UK’s growing dependency on imports and balance the decline of the North Sea. The oil and gas industry has been operating in Scotland since the 19th century and looks forward to continuing to operate safely and with the minimum of environmental impact or many decades to come.” Scottish energy minister, Fergus Ewing, said: “I note the publication of this British Geological Survey report, which highlights that only relatively modest amounts of shale gas and shale oil are likely to be present in the central belt, only a fraction of which could be realistically recovered. We are taking a balanced, evidence-based approach to the development of unconventional gas, and convened an Expert Scientific Panel on Unconventional Oil and Gas to examine the issue.\" He added that Scotland has \"huge renewable electricity potential\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/apr/04/solar-farms-spread-unrestricted-british-countryside-greg-barker-wind","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-04T15:28:19Z","webTitle":"Solar farms 'will not spread unrestricted across British countryside'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/04/solar-farms-spread-unrestricted-british-countryside-greg-barker-wind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/apr/04/solar-farms-spread-unrestricted-british-countryside-greg-barker-wind","fields":{"headline":"Solar farms 'will not spread unrestricted across British countryside'","bodyText":"Solar farms must not spread unrestricted across the British countryside and become as controversial as onshore wind turbines, a minister warned on Friday. Instead, solar panels will be rolled out on millions of homes, businesses, schools and government buildings, said energy and climate change minister Greg Barker. Barker, one the greenest Conservative ministers, launched the government's first solar power strategy at the end of a week in which senior Tory sources revealed their plans to heavily curb or even dismantle windfarms after the next election. The number of large solar farms, often housing more than 100,000 panels, has doubled in the first three months of 2014 but some have attracted local protests. At the opening of a new Sunsolar panel factory in Birmingham, Barker told the Guardian: \"I do not want solar farms to become the new onshore wind. Solar power enjoys huge popularity, so we have to be careful. I do not want to see unrestricted growth of solar farms in the British countryside.\" Barker has previously called large farms \"monsters\" and, due the subsidies they receive, \"gold-diggers\". But he said there was a great opportunity elsewhere for solar power, which has fallen in price by two-thirds in the last four years. Barker said he expected the 500,000 homes with solar panels to double by the end of 2015. He also announced streamlined planning rules to make it simpler to put panels on large industrial and commercial roofs. Putting panels on just one in six roofs would generate electricity equivalent to two nuclear power stations. On Thursday, carmaker Jaguar announced the completion of the UK's largest rooftop solar array, with 21,000 panels on the roof of their engine factory in Staffordshire providing a capacity of 5.8MW. Barker also announced a programme to put up to 4m solar panels (1GW), on the roofs of government-owned buildings across the UK before the end of the next parliament in 2020. A new unit in the Cabinet Office, under Francis Maude, is working on this programme, which will be funded by the private sector. Another new programme aims to put solar panels on the roofs of all of England's 22,000 schools, which currently spend £500m on energy every year. Barker said he wanted to see 20GW of solar power in the UK by 2020, although the current government forecast is for 12GW. \"My 20GW is predicated on the ability of the industry to drive costs down to give grid parity [the same price as electricity generated from conventional sources] by 2020. That is eminently possible,\" he said. \"But we will not get there with high subsidies.\" Solar power capacity has doubled in the UK in the last two years to about 4GW, although it remains far behind Germany's 35GW. \"It's encouraging to see the prime minister's Conservative colleagues promoting a positive solar vision for the UK and as a solution to climate change, particularly when it comes just days after Cameron took a swipe at onshore windfarms,\" said Friends of the Earth executive director, Andy Atkins. Paul Barwell, chief executive of the Solar Trade Association, welcomed the strategy: \"With the Royal Society, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and even Shell anticipating solar could be the world's biggest energy source, the UK needs to make the most of its R&amp;D, product design and manufacturing skills to steal a march in the global clean energy race.\" Ray Noble, co-chair of the solar strategy board that advises ministers, said solar power could play an important role in the UK's energy security as old power stations are closed in the next few years. \"If we have built the solar equivalent of a big power station in the two-three years by 2015, and can do so again, politicians are going to have to pay attention.\" Other industry figures tried to play down the negative impact of large solar farms on the popularity of the technology with the public. Reza Shaybani, chairman of the British Photovoltaic Association, said: \"There are a very, very few projects sited in the wrong place, that spoil it for the rest.\" Farm buildings and land host about half of the UK's solar panels at the moment, and National Farmers Union renewable energy adviser, Jonathan Scurlock, said: \"There is a substantial difference between wind turbines, which are very visible – and like Marmite, you love them or hate them – and solar farms which are very subtle when well-sited.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/nov/24/iran-nuclear-deal-completed-foreign-ministers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-24T02:24:41Z","webTitle":"Iran nuclear deal complete after days of talks, ministers confirm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/24/iran-nuclear-deal-completed-foreign-ministers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/nov/24/iran-nuclear-deal-completed-foreign-ministers","fields":{"headline":"Iran nuclear deal complete after days of talks, ministers confirm","bodyText":"Iran and six world powers reached a breakthrough deal on Sunday to curb Tehran's nuclear programme in exchange for limited sanctions relief. The agreement between Iran and the United States, France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia was nailed down after more than four days of negotiations in the Swiss city of Geneva. The accord was designed as a package of confidence-building steps to ease decades of tensions and confrontation over Tehran's nuclear aspirations. European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, who has been co-ordinating talks with Iran on behalf of the major powers, said it created time and space for talks aimed at reaching a comprehensive solution to the dispute. \"This is only a first step,\" the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, told a news conference. \"We need to start moving in the direction of restoring confidence, a direction in which we have managed to move against in the past.\" In Washington, President Barack Obama said the deal was an important first step towards a comprehensive solution to Iran's nuclear programme. The long drawn-out diplomacy had \"opened up a new path toward a world that is more secure\", he said. The provisions of the deal \"cut off Iran's most likely paths to a bomb\", Obama said. \"Meanwhile, this first step will create time and space over the next six months for more negotiations to fully address our comprehensive concerns about the Iranian programme. And because of this agreement, Iran cannot use negotiations as cover to advance its programme.\" In negotiations for a longer-term solution over the next six months, \"nothing will be agreed to unless everything is agreed to\", he said. \"If Iran seizes this opportunity, the Iranian people will benefit from rejoining the international community, and we can begin to chip away at the mistrust between our two nations. This would provide Iran with a dignified path to forge a new beginning with the wider world based on mutual respect. If, on the other hand, Iran refuses, it will face growing pressure and isolation.\" The agreement would make Israel and other US allies safer, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, said. He said while Obama would not take off the table the possible use of force against Iran, he believed it was necessary first to exhaust diplomacy. But Israel's intelligence minister, Yuval Steinitz, who is responsible for monitoring Iran's nuclear program, said the deal was based on \"Iranian deception and self-delusion\" and there was no reason for the world to be celebrating. The West fears that Iran has been seeking to develop a nuclear weapons capability. It denies that, saying its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only. A senior US official said the agreement halted progress on Iran's nuclear programme, including construction of the Arak research reactor, which is of special concern for the West as it can yield potential bomb material. The deal would neutralise Iran's stockpile of uranium refined to a fissile concentration of 20%, which is a short step away from the level needed for weapons, and called for intrusive UN nuclear inspections, the official said. Iran has also committed to stop uranium enrichment above a fissile purity of 5%, a US fact sheet said. Refined uranium can be used to fuel nuclear power plants – Iran's stated goal – but also provide the fissile core of an atomic bomb if refined much further. The deal did not recognise Iran's right to enrich uranium and sanctions would still be enforced, the US official added. Iran will get access to $4.2bn (£2.59bn) in foreign exchange as part of the accord, and was also expected to receive limited sanctions relief on gold, petrochemicals and cars, a Western diplomat said. The British foreign secretary, William Hague, said on Twitter it was an \"important and encouraging\" first-stage agreement and meant Iran's nuclear programme \"won't move forward for 6 months and parts rolled back\". The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said the deal only confirmed Iran's right to civil nuclear power. \"After years of blockages, the agreement in Geneva on Iran's nuclear programme is an important step to preserving security and peace,\" Fabius said in a statement. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, and foreign ministers of the five other world powers joined the negotiations with Iran early on Saturday as the two sides appeared to be edging closer to a long-sought preliminary agreement. The Western powers' goal was cap Iran's nuclear energy programme, to remove any risk of Tehran covertly refining uranium to a level suitable for bombs. Tehran, whose oil-dependent economy has been severely damaged by tightening Western sanctions over the past few years, denies it would ever \"weaponise\" enrichment. Diplomacy was stepped up after the landslide election of Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate, as Iranian president in June, replacing Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Rouhani aims to mend fences with big powers and get sanctions lifted. He obtained crucial public backing from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, keeping powerful hardline critics at bay. On a Twitter account widely recognised as representing Rouhani, a message after the agreement was announced said, \"Iranian people's vote for moderation &amp; constructive engagement + tireless efforts by negotiating teams are to open new horizons\". Before Sunday's agreement, Israel said the deal being offered would give Iran more time to master nuclear technology and amass potential bomb fuel. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told media in Moscow on Thursday that Iran was essentially given an \"unbelievable Christmas present – the capacity to maintain this [nuclear] breakout capability for practically no concessions at all\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2014/aug/28/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-pentagon-adviser","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-28T10:40:29Z","webTitle":"Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare: 'We worked with a Pentagon adviser'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/28/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-pentagon-adviser","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/aug/28/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-pentagon-adviser","fields":{"headline":"Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare: 'We worked with a Pentagon adviser'","bodyText":"The scene is exciting but implausible. It’s a shoot out on the Golden Gate bridge, taking place 45 years in the future. Soldiers wearing bionic exoskeletons leap over trucks, firing bizarre “directed energy” weapons that send out fatal force waves. Drones patrol above, identifying and shooting at targets, one combatant throws a smart grenade that momentarily hovers in the air before locking onto an enemy and scorching in. It is a sequence typical of the Call of Duty series, Activision’s billion-dollar shoot-’em-up cash cow. Since its arrival in 2003, the titles have relied on flashy hyper-violence, Michael Bay explosions and ludicrous plotlines. The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare titles reveled in post-9/11 paranoia, inventing eastern European ultra nationalist groups and super weapons of mega destruction. The series has shifted 140m units. Advanced Warfare looks like more of the same. It’s 2060 and a terrorist organisation named KVA has pulled off a global atrocity, detonating a series of nuclear power plants, and plunging the world into chaos. With nation states unable to re-build their armed forces, private military contractors are managing the fight back. But they have their own agendas. The founder of the largest, Atlas, is Jonathan Irons, played with obvious relish by Kevin Spacey. He thinks he has a better plan for the future. He thinks of war as a marketplace and countries as corporations. He wants to launch a hostile takeover of the USA. Rocket boosted exoskeletons? Private military organisations with imperialist leanings? It’s all nonsense right? Not according to Michael Condrey, co-founder of Sledgehammer Games, the studio behind Advanced Warfare. The next threat to the USA “Three years ago, right after we finished Modern Warfare 3, we started thinking about how to change Call of Duty,” he says. “We brought in a lot of outside help – military advisers, futurologists - we got together with a scenario planner from the department of defense, who is active in the Pentagon. His job is to think about future threats and prepare ‘what if’ scenarios for the US government. So we asked him, what do you think will be the conflict of tomorrow?” Apparently, the source quickly ruled out China (“he said it’s too big, it’ll eventually collapse under its own economic weight”), a resurgence of the Cold War with Russia, and a consolidation of emergent Islamic extremist states. Instead, the adviser predicted that the next threat to the security of the United States would come from a private military company. It may be some billion-dollar contract gone bad or a sudden tipping point in the ratio between national military and contracted forces. “We thought that was fascinating and provocative,” says Condrey. “What happens when an organisation that’s built for profit has access to all the latest weapons and technology – an organisation that can operate outside of the Geneva Convention, that can be purchased by the highest bidder? What if that got out of control? “This was around the time that Greece was collapsing economically, there were riots – and there was an understanding that, the reason PMCs have had such an opportunity to grow, is that funding a standing army is very expensive for a modern nation state. Why not outsource war? It’s better for PR – you don’t have to explain to parents why their kids are dying in battles on foreign soil.” The team read up on modern PMCs. It researched the activities of well-known examples such as Blackwater, the controversial US company that won millions of dollars worth of contracts to provide security in post-war Iraq. Founder, Erik Prince, is surely a model for Jonathan Irons, especially after a series of congressional hearings over the company’s operations, and other wrangles with the US government. Directed energy and other weapons of the “future” As for the weaponry, Sledgehammer has used military advisors to ensure its authenticity. These people aren’t difficult to find or employ – primarily because many of them play Call of Duty. “We’ve been fortunate that the series has a lot of fans across military organisations, and within the entertainment industry,” says Condrey. “This draws a lot of interest, and a great deal of desire to help Call of Duty. “Often, we are able to extend our network through existing relationships within the Call of Duty franchise. For example, we worked with Mark Bohl, writer of Hurt Locker, and were put in contact with his retired Navy Seal Team 6 adviser through shared contacts. Other times, we research experts in the field and reach out directly. Retired Delta Commander, Dalton Furty, is an example. We read his book, Kill Bin Laden, and made an inquiry on his interest and availability.” The result is that every gun, vehicle and aircraft in the game has a basis in current weapons research – whether that’s the Breacher pump action directed energy shotgun or the XS1 Vulcan, effectively an airborne laser blaster. “We wanted the game to be grounded and believable, but how do we do that if it’s set 50 years in the future?” says Condrey. “So we agreed with the designers, if you can’t point to R&amp;D or a prototype, it can’t go in the game. At one point we had this concept for a teleportation grenade – you throw it, and where it lands, you teleport there. But it’s not in the game because it’s science fiction.” However, pulsed energy, microwave, laser and sonic weapons have been in development for decades, and research is ongoing. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and other major manufacturers are all building systems. The North American market alone will be worth $10bn by 2020 according to MicroMarket Monitor. Meanwhile, the exoskeletons worn by soldiers in the game, which players are able to upgrade with a range of performance-enhancing features, come from a more benign source. “We looked at how Daewoo, one of the biggest tech firms in Korea, has developed exoskeletons that are used in the ship yards – they allow dock workers to lift 500lbs. That blew my mind. OK, we don’t think that, in the near future, soldiers will be doing 20ft boost jumps like our exo does, but we do feel that 50 years from now … we’ve probably been conservative.” The war on story For some, this is a difficult and troubling concept. Call of Duty is a big, bloody spectacle of a game series; a gung-ho celebration of military might. For all its millions of fans, it has detractors that see it as all that’s wrong with the mainstream games industry – the obsession with gunfire and power. Should developers be mining real-world expertise for narrative authenticity? Is it right to draw on real-life conflicts and experiences so that players can shoot each other online with realistic assault rifles? But then of course, Hollywood has been doing the same thing for years, employing military advisers like Dale Dye and Harry Humphries to add legitimacy, not just to worthy dramas, but to popcorn shootfests. The difference is that video games are still a young medium; they are viewed with suspicion. People worry about the effects they have, people worry about the suitability of an interactive medium to tell stories of war and tragedy. Can Advanced Warfare shake up the series in narrative terms? Many of the Sledgehammer team came from making the respected and atmospheric sci-fi horror title Dead Space – they know how to tell an interactive story. They say they want to tell a good one here. “We really looked at the narrative execution,” says Condrey. “Not just Kevin Spacey’s performance, but the whole story arc. I think there are moments that will be challenging. “Right now, we’re all talking about this third golden age of television in the US – that inspires us. Games have long way to go to deliver on the emotional narratives we see in, say, Game of Thrones. We have to learn lessons there, we have to learn about emotional attachment to characters, provocative situations, loss. We need to make those a big part of video games.” In the end, that would be a more impressive achievement than recreating any weapons system that military science has to offer.

Yet her prescription for improving the position of mothers ignores the pivotal role of fathers. One way in which society can \"do more to enable mothers to play a full role at home and in the workplace\" is to encourage and enable fathers to play a full role at home. The example of the Nordic countries shows that a key first step would be a period of parental leave for fathers on a \"use it or lose it\" basis. The coalition government proposed this but then got cold feet. I will be moving an amendment to the children and families bill to give fathers an independent right to parental leave.

The example of Drifters – the new comedy show from the producers of The Inbetweeners – is a great one. Written by Jessica Knappett, it's up there with the best of them that we've had the pleasure to post-produce. While Knappett felt no \"sex imbalance in the writers' room\", this may not be the case for many. It would be good to see more awards and events to celebrate the growing success of female writers, producers and directors. Shelley Fox Managing director, Suite TV London W1 We let other states run the UK From my first job in 1950 until my final retirement in 2012 my work was for British industry. I share Will Hutton's shame at George Osborne's courting of the Chinese (Comment). This country built the world's first nuclear power station but now we have to get organisations from other countries to finance and manage the design and construction of a new power station. One little appreciated consequence of the shutdown and sell-off of British companies is the closure of their R&amp;D. Thus we no longer have the know-how to design a nuclear power station. Apart from the serious commercial implications of all this the extreme irony is that a government determined to sell off every state-owned enterprise is happy for nationalised companies to provide our energy and run our railways (German railways operate a significant number of trains here). John Buekett Kings Langley Herts Be proud of our courts Nick Cohen states that \"foreigners now make up almost two thirds of the litigants in the commercial court\" as if it were a criticism of our current culture. But he is quite wrong on two counts (\"Why Frieze art fair reflects London all too well\", Comment). First of all, I believe that a similar proportion has obtained since at least the second world war. Secondly, it is a matter of pride rather than shame. A very large numberof maritime and commodity contracts contain clauses which require disputes to be resolved according to English law and procedure. Parties having no connection with England are happy to leave the resolution of their disputes in particular to the commercial court, because of the richness of English law, the wide range of experienced lawyers and the integrity of the judiciary. The availability of the commercial court to foreigners gives rise to a huge source of revenue for the United Kingdom.

Declined to say how many people would lose their winter fuel allowance if she was reelected, saying it would only be decided in consultation after the election. Said she could be trusted to keep her manifesto promises after Neil listed several key policies she had failed to deliver on. Insisted her cabinet colleagues supported her pledge to cut immigration levels, despite claims to the contrary from the former chancellor, George Osborne. Refused, once again, to rule out rises in income tax and national insurance, saying only in general terms that the Tories wanted low taxes. Neil closes by asking how long May intends to remain in No 10. She will only say that she is concentrating on this election and the next parliament. Beyond that, she will not be drawn. Neil raises George Osborne’s claim that no cabinet members support the immigration target May has pledged. She denies it, saying “it’s me and my team” that want to control immigration. Next up: Neil points out that May has failed since entering office to keep her promise on getting net migration figures down. He asks: how can people trust her? May insists her party wants to get it down, while Labour does not. Neil tries again, asking whether or not May thinks that restating a promise she has repeatedly failed to keep is eroding trust. May says people will need to decide whom they trust: Labour or the Conservatives. How many pensioners will lose their winter fuel allowance, asks Neil. May declines to give a number, saying only that her government will consult on it. “It’s a vague promise, uncosted, you don’t know,” Neil says. May reiterates that they intend to consult. “Wouldn’t you have done that before you came up with it?” Neil shoots back. Neil moves on to the “just about managing”. He tells May that, despite her saying she is on the side, things are getting harder for those people. She says she wants a stronger economy with higher paid jobs and lower energy bills. But Neil persists, telling her that people are being squeezed. “In what way are you on their side?” Again, May tells him that she wants to bring economic prosperity. On tax, May says the Tories are a party of low taxes and want to reduce them. But, once again, she avoids the question on whether or not she will she raise taxes, saying only that she wants the tax system to be sustainable. Neil then asks May about the NHS’s recent troubles. The investment is “too little, too late”, he suggests. May accepts that targets have been missed but says that is not the be all and end all in the health service. Planned infrastructure spending of £10bn will be separate and will “come from a variety of sources”, May says. Neil asks how they Tories will pay for their promised extra £8bn for the NHS. May talks about the economy and social care. She says the party’s “economic credibility is not in doubt”, while Labour’s is. “Your ability to answer this question may be in doubt,” Neil says. Pressed to say where the money will come from, May again touts the Tories’ record on the economy, which will “generate the funds”. Neil asks May what the cap will be, “now that you’re in favour of it”. May refuses to say, explaining that it will come out of her planned consultation. Neil asks why was this not in the manifesto. May insists that the idea of a consultation was, though the idea of a cap was rejected. She again presses the line that fake claims have been put about by her opponents, accusing them of “playing politics” with the issue. Neil gets on to the social care U-turn. “Nothing has changed from the principles,” May insists. She says the social care system will collapse if it is not fixed. Neil presses her: “You say nothing has changed,” before hitting her with quotes from her own health secretary rejecting the policy the party now proposes. May needs to be honest, Neil suggests. May insists she is being honest and says the party is setting out a plan it believes will fix the problem. She accuses Corbyn of seeking to “sneak into No 10” by playing on people’s fears. May insists the Tories have “not rewritten” the manifesto because the principles remain the same. The manifesto explicitly rejected a cap on social care costs. Neil presses her further on the honesty issue. May says all she has done is clarify what the policy is. Neil suggests that May thought she could get away with winning with “uncosted and half-baked” policies, which May rejects. Andrew Neil’s interview with Theresa May is under way on the BBC now. It is part of a series of interviews with the party leaders. He opens by asking her about the cut in her poll lead. “There’s only one poll that counts,” May responds: the election itself. She portrays the vote as one about who people want to conduct the Brexit negotiations: her or the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. The BBC has released some details from Andrew Neil’s interview with Theresa May, which is due to air at 7pm. The prime minister insisted once again that “nothing has changed”, despite the Tories having explicitly rejected the policy that they propose. She said the cap meant “protecting people for the future”, the BBC reported. We are providing a system that provides sustainability in our social care for the future and we have got an ageing population. We need to do this otherwise our system will collapse. We have analysed whether or not May is right to claim that “nothing has changed”. Critics have accused her of presiding over a “manifesto meltdown” but she has claimed that rival parties have been “trying to scare” elderly people. Nicola Sturgeon is widely expected to confirm she still supports a 50p top rate of income tax, but only if it is implemented UK-wide, as she reopens her battle with Labour over the right way to support public spending at the Scottish National party’s manifesto launch on Tuesday. Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said at her manifesto launch on Monday that she was justified in calling for higher across-the-board tax rates in Scotland than those proposed by John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, for the rest of the UK. McDonnell has promised no tax rises for those earning less than £80,000. Dugdale said that since Holyrood has full autonomy to set different rates and bands to the rest of the UK above 10p in the pound, she can raise taxes to fund Scottish priorities. Her officials said raising the basic rate by 1p to 21p for those earning above £11,500 and the higher rate to 41p for those earning over £42,385 would, alongside a 50p top rate for those earning £150,000 or more in Scotland, raise £690m a year. With that, Scottish Labour could: Increase child benefit by £240 a year by 2020, lifting tens of thousands of children out of poverty. Stop cuts to council services, including schools. Prevent further public sector job cuts. But, if Labour wins the general election, Dugdale will face claims from her rivals that her tax increases are unnecessary, since Jeremy Corbyn’s plans to boost spending by £41bn UK-wide will mean Scottish parliament funding will rise by £3bn by 2022. Angus Robertson, the SNP’s deputy leader, said after Dugdale’s manifesto launch: Labour cannot pretend to support ordinary workers when, at the same time, they want to hit them with a fresh tax bombshell – something even the UK Labour party have avoided. As always on tax, on Trident and on Brexit, Labour are at sixes and sevens. Andrew Neil has been interviewing Theresa May for a programme going out on the BBC at 7pm. He is being interviewed about his interview now. He says they recorded the interview at 4.30pm. They recorded 27 minutes. It was recorded “as live”, meaning it will go out as it was recorded. It was a wide-ranging interview, he says. He says that, whatever he asked, May usually said that she knew how to run the economy and handle Brexit. He says the campaign is not going the way May expected. She is “more on the defensive than she expected to to be”. Q: Was she rattled? Neil says she was on the defensive. He says May insisted that she had not changed her position, even though he put it to her what Jeremy Hunt said about this last week. Most commentators will conclude that there has been a change. He says May would not rule out taxes going up. Q: How are you approaching these interviews? Very much with a BBC1 prime-time audience in mind. He is trying not to be too technical and to break out of ‘Westminster bubble’ thinking. That’s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over the blog. The row over Tory plans for social care which unfolded in a quiet north Wales village has been an unexpected boost to Labour on the doorstep, according to the constituency’s MP Ian Lucas, who is defending the seat where Theresa May was forced to say that care costs would be capped. The Wrexham MP, who is battling to keep his seat with a wafer-thin majority over the Tories, said it was palpable how the chaos over elderly care had resonated with voters. When the Guardian joined him campaigning in Brynffynnon, central Wrexham, a few hours after the prime minister’s speech, several voters said they had changed their mind about who to vote for over the past week. Lucas said the party now, perhaps unexpectedly, had a doorstep-ready message for pensioners who had deserted the party in 2015. He said: We lost a lot of elderly voters in 2015, we did really badly with pensioners. And with the way the Tories have treated these voters now, it has given us a lot of help in dealing with those concerns. We can talk to them about it, and we can say, we’re keeping the triple lock, winter fuel allowance. It’s a very simple message, stick with us and we’ll fight for those things. And we didn’t have that to say in 2015. In Wales, the so-called dementia tax would not apply because the issue is devolved to the Welsh assembly, though means-testing of winter fuel allowance would come into force. But Lucas said the row over social care funding still had cut through in places such as Wrexham because it seemed at odds with the principles of the NHS. Whether you’re a millionaire or not, you get care. People buy into the NHS and support it because of that – that’s why this feels so wrong. My mother had dementia, she died during the last general election, I’ve been through the mill with it myself. Lucas, an MP for 16 years, admitted Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was a topic on the doorstep, generally coupled with concerns about his record on defence. When voters are worried, Lucas uses a tactic that many independent-minded MPs have used on the doorstep. “I’ve seen five Labour leaders and five Tory leaders, they come and go, you’re voting for the person who is representing you,” he said. “I’m the best person to stand up for Wrexham. “We need a strong opposition, just look at what’s happened in just three days when she’s put under pressure.” Here are three blogs about the Theresa May U-turn that are worth reading. Tom Clark at Prospect says May has mishandled this U-turn. The potential problems are of two types. If May wins this election, which she is still overwhelmingly likely to do, her backbenchers will now fancy their chances of seeing her off on anything they don’t like. If you can get her to back off on self-employed tax or social care, they will reason, why not school dinner cuts, local authority funding or maybe even grammar schools? Governing is a lot more difficult when that is the mood. Secondly, there is the wider insidious damage of coming to be seen as a wobbler. Margaret Thatcher had a brief cluster of bad polls in the 1987 campaign, and her close ally Lord Young was soon shouting at Norman Tebbit that “we’re losing this fucking election.” Whatever happened in private, however, the lady herself was never seen to panic and went on to clean up on election day. In 1997, likewise, faint Labour hearts began fluttering when one ICM poll showed the party’s lead being squeezed down to three points; Tony Blair was always beset with anxiety about his advantage slipping away, but he never let himself look worried to the electorate, and his projection of confidence was rewarded with a landslide. May could very well still win one as well. But she has let the country catch a glimpse of the whites of her eyes. She might yet live to regret it. Gary Gibbon at Channel 4 News says the episode giving Nick Timothy too much power over the manifesto may have been a mistake. Amongst other things it shows the perils of entrusting the manifesto to one man. Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s joint chief of staff, has been working with Cabinet minister Ben Gummer and some others on the manifesto, but there is no question who is pre-eminent and no question whose brainchild this now ditched policy was. Nick Timothy even inserted a swipe (p65) at “the Dilnot Report, which mostly benefited a small number of wealthier people.” The Tories are now picking up Sir Andrew Dilnot’s idea of a cap on individuals’ exposure to care costs. Civil servants will say this is a reflection of the sort of problems encountered in Whitehall, where Mr Timothy (and his fellow joint chief of staff, Fiona Hill) want everything signed off by them before it meets the eyes of Mrs May. Plenty of officials worry that raises the prospect of Mrs May not getting their advice unfiltered. James Forsyth at Coffee House says the U-turn marks a “deep blow” for May because it shows her out of touch with the core beliefs of her supporters. One of May’s great assets as Tory leader has been her connection with the base, their sense that she was one of them. In many ways she is, she joined the party as a teenager and met her husband at a Tory event and still goes out canvassing most weekends. This trust has made them willing to follow her. But the row over social care has for the first time suggested that her values and theirs might not be totally aligned. Earlier today the Conservatives bought the rights to the top Google search when you type in “dementia tax”. It was a failed attempt to defuse a row over Theresa May’s social care policy. Before news of the U-turn broke, I asked them for their thinking behind the move, which meant the first thing voters searching on Google saw was a link to a website titled The so-called ‘dementia tax’ – get the real facts. A Conservative spokesman explained: It is quite right we take steps to tackle the misinformation and fear being spread by Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party. The term “dementia tax” was being used this morning on the front page of both the Financial Times (see 8.38am) and Daily Mail as well as by Labour. After a bruising day on the issue, the Conservatives appear to be no longer buying the top slot for the term. It has been snapped up by Labour which has set up a page called The Dementia Tax - Get The Real Facts. The Scottish National party has been forced into retreat after election candidates attacked an Edinburgh nurse who told Nicola Sturgeon during a live BBC leaders debate that her low pay forced her to use food banks. Claire Austin, who works for NHS Lothian, came under intense criticism from SNP supporters on Twitter after she challenged the first minister’s decision to hold nurses’ pay rises at 1% for the last eight years. Austin said she was prepared to go on strike over pay with the Royal College of Nursing, which itself reports nurses around the UK using food banks to supplement low pay. She told Sturgeon: “You have no idea how demoralising it is to work within the NHS.” Joanna Cherry QC, the SNP candidate defending Edinburgh South West, was forced to delete a tweet wrongly alleging Austin was married to a Tory councillor. Cherry apologised and retweeted Shona Robison, the Scottish government’s health secretary, who said: “Important to hear voices of nurses in #leadersdebate, we are offering to work with unions on pay.” Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Tory MSP sitting alongside Cherry in the BBC debate spin room, alleged the MP had been told to make the Tory councillor claim by Jeane Freeman, the Scottish government welfare minister. “It was a disgraceful episode and Nicola Sturgeon and her party should be thoroughly ashamed,” he said. “This smear operation points to something endemic within the SNP.” Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories also attacked SNP activists who latched on to Austin’s Facebook pages, which showed her sipping champagne as she celebrated new year in the Plaza hotel in New York, dining at Malmaison in Edinburgh and apparently show her daughter at a fee-paying school. On the campaign trail on Monday, Sturgeon apologised for the social media attacks on Austin. She said: The nurse on the debate last night was absolutely entitled to raise the issue that she did and, as I said, she raised an issue that I think is one of the biggest in this campaign, the level and value of real wages, not just in the public sector but in the private sector. Austin said friends and family had paid for those expenses seen on Facebook, and she was defended by the Poverty Alliance, a voluntary sector organisation that oversees the Scottish government’s living-wage programme. The alliance said it was wrong to make moral judgments about the way people lived, adding: People move in and out of poverty, very few people remain in poverty throughout their entire lives. Items can also be gifts, bought on finance or with a credit card. It is also important to remember that people on low incomes deserve the same treats we all enjoy. The Evening Standard editorials have become a lot more interesting since George Osborne became editor. Here is an extract from today’s. The current Tory leaders should have been ready to defend their approach. Instead we had a weekend of wobbles that presumably prompted today’s U-turn. The Pensions Secretary Damian Green was unable to answer basic questions in a TV interview about who will lose their fuel payments, and how much extra money will go into social care. Either the Government is prepared to remove these payments from millions of pensioners who are not in poverty, and don’t receive pension credit, and spend their substantial savings on social care; or they chicken out, target the tiny percentage of pensioners who are on higher tax rates, save paltry sums and accept the whole manoeuvre is a gimmick. Certainly, if the savings are to pay for a new care cap, then many pensioners will lose their winter fuel payment. This isn’t for consultation after an election — it’s an issue of honesty before an election. Equally, Boris Johnson should have spent more time genning up on his own notes rather than trying to steal those of his TV interviewer. When asked about changes to social-care funding, he immediately retreated, saying that while the broad thrust was right, the details might change. It was unfortunate that this weekend, of all weekends, was when he compared other politicians to blancmanges. Johnson used the blancmange line in an article in the Mail on Sunday in which he said that if Jeremy Corbyn were prime minister, “he would go into the negotiating chamber with all the authority of a smacked blancmange.” The Tories are not planning to announce a proposed level for the social care cap, my colleague Anushka Asthana reports. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, says Theresa May is lying about her social care U-turn and that, if she can lie about this, she can lie about other things too. Northern Ireland secretary James Brokenshire challenged Jeremy Corbyn to condemn the IRA after he failed to do so in specific terms – as opposed to in generalised terms – in an interview with Sky News on Sunday. Brokenshire’s comments were passed on by a reporter from the Sun during the launch of Labour’s arts manifesto in Hull earlier. Asked whether he condemned the IRA as terrorists, Corbyn said: I condemn all acts of violence in Northern Ireland wherever they came. I spent the whole of the 1980s representing constituencies with large numbers of Irish people in them. We wanted peace, we wanted justice, we wanted a solution. The first ceasefire helped to bring about those talks which represented all sections of the community of Northern Ireland. The Labour government of 1997 helped bring in the historic Good Friday agreement, the basis of which was a recognition of the differing cultural histories and values of Northern Ireland. It stood the test of time and it’s still there. We have a devolved administration. We should recognise that that peace was achieved by a lot of bravery both in the unionist and in the nationalist community. People that walked a very difficult extra mile when they were under pressure from their communities not to do so, both republicans and unionists, walked that extra mile and brought us the Good Friday agreement. I think we should use this election to thank those people who brought about the Good Friday agreement. We are going to be working with the devolved administration to make sure Brexit doesn’t bring about a barbed wire border between the north and south. If you are interested in knowing who first coined the term “dementia tax”, this thread, in response to a Twitter question by the BBC’s Amol Rajan, is interesting. The consensus is that it emerged organically, although the Spectator’s Will Heaven is credited with being the first person to use it in an article. Here are some tweets from Prof Matthew Goodwin, the academic and Ukip expert, on the back of today’s Guardian/ICM poll results. Support for Labour in Wales has surged while the Conservative momentum has gone into reverse, a new poll suggests. Earlier polls seemed to indicate the Tories were on course for a historic breakthrough in a traditional Labour heartland. But the latest YouGov Welsh barometer poll suggests that Labour could be on course to win one more seat in Wales than in 2015 – Gower in south Wales. The poll asked people how they would vote in the general election. The results are: Labour: 44% (+9 compared with a poll carried out at the start of the month) Conservatives: 34% (-7) Plaid Cymru: 9% (-2) Liberal Democrats: 6% (-1) Ukip: 5% (+1) Others: 3% (+1) Roger Scully, professor of political science at Cardiff University’s Wales governance centre, said in his blog on the figures: While Labour have been making some progress in the Britain-wide polls, it is not on the scale of what we see here in Wales – where the party are fully 14 points higher than they were in the first poll of the campaign. Assuming that the findings in our new Welsh poll are correct, they may have been at least partially influenced by the timing of the poll – the fieldwork for which was conducted in the immediate aftermath of the death of [former Welsh Labour leader] Rhodri Morgan. It is possible that there may have been some short-term sympathy boost for Labour. While short-term factors may account for some of what we see in this latest barometer poll, it does appear that after the extraordinary success of the Conservative party at the beginning of the election campaign, they are losing some ground to Labour. At least for the moment, Labour seem to be winning the campaign, if not the election as a whole. That is particularly true in Wales. The recent local elections showed the resilience of the Welsh Labour party. A party does not dominate the politics of a nation for nearly a century, as Labour have done in Wales, simply by accident. Challenged strongly by the Conservatives in this election, Labour seem to be fighting back strongly. At Welsh Labour’s manifesto launch first minister Carwyn Jones has promised a “real partnership” between the government in Cardiff and a Labour Westminster administration. This feels like a shift in tone - at the start of the general election campaign it was expected that Welsh Labour would try to maintain a distance from Jeremy Corbyn, believing he was a vote-loser in Wales. The Welsh Labour manifesto carries an image of Corbyn - though he is pictured alone rather than with Jones. Speaking at the manifesto launch in Delyn, north Wales, Jones said: Welsh Labour is in power in Wales and we want to establish a real partnership with a UK Labour government. Our Welsh Labour manifesto is what we can do together – with your support. It builds on the vital commitments already announced by Jeremy Corbyn and his team. By working together with the UK party, we’ve brought forward proposals that will make Wales a fairer, more prosperous country – with power closer to the people. He said that after years of Tory cuts, an estimated £1.5bn extra would come to Wales every year through UK Labour spending plans. But Jones also made it clear there was a need for a separate Welsh Labour. He said the party in Wales had become a “real, campaigning, fire-breathing entity” thanks largely to the guidance of the late former first minister Rhodri Morgan, who died last week. You can read the manifesto here. Here’s some key commitments from it. It’s striking how many of the headline grabbers relate to north Wales, where the Tories hope to make gains. The party has promised “big projects” to get the economy moving including: Helping deliver the planned £14bn Wyfla Newydd nuclear power station on Anglesey Backing the tidal lagoon project in Swansea. Securing rail electrification for north Wales A metro system for south and north-east Wales and M4 relief road in south Wales. Backing a third crossing over the Menai Strait to support the economy of Anglesey and north west Wales. The manifesto says it will work to abolish the Severn Bridge tolls and promises a new development bank of Wales – in the north. On higher education it says education should be free and – if funding allowed – there should be no tuition fees. When a Labour government is elected in Westminster, it says it will look again at the issue. The manifesto also says it is working towards getting one million people speaking Welsh. Sir Andrew Dilnot, who chaired the commission that first produced plans for a cap on the amount people should have to pay for social care, has welcomed Theresa May’s U-turn. This is what he said in an interview with Sky News. Dilnot welcomed the Conservative U-turn, saying it would provide “a great deal of reassurance to people”. He urged the government not to set the cap much higher than at the £72,000 planned by the David Cameron government. Originally his commission proposed that the level should be set between £25,000 and £50,000 (in 2010 prices), which would be equivalent to a maximum of £65,000 today. A figure around that would seem reasonable. So I do hope that when the amount is fixed it is not set at a significantly higher level than the £72,000 that was put into legislation by the last government and was in the last Conservative manifesto. He said the government could afford to set the cap at around £70,000. It is certainly the case that doing things in this case space has a significant cost. But the cost shouldn’t be exaggerated. The cost of a cap at that sort of level, £72,000, would be about £2bn a year, compared to total public spending of more than £700bn. Dilnot said that winter fuel payments, which the Tories were planning to means test, cost £2.1bn a year. And he said that the Tory plan to take into account the value of someone’s house, as well as their assets, when care delivered at home is being means tested would also save the government money. So, overall this should be certainly manageable. And it is a sign of what kind of society we want to be. If we want to be a good and caring society, then looking after people in this particular form of extremity seems like an obvious thing. He said there was a principled case for a cap. It is a perfectly reasonable argument to say we should have higher levels of inheritance tax, if there are people who think that inheritance tax, particularly for people with large houses, should be higher. That’s a perfectly reasonable position. What does not seem to be a reasonable position is that we should have an inheritance tax that’s much higher if you happen to be one of the one people in 10 who’s unlucky enough to have dementia. Tories in the Theresa May camp are hitting back at George Osborne over the Evening Standard’s splash headline (see 2.38pm), according to HuffPost’s Paul Waugh. Chris Giles, the FT’s economics editor, has produced a graph that seeks to explain how someone spending £150,000 on care would be affected by the various Tory plans. He explains the figures in the tweets below. Corbyn says there are 1 million people in the country who need social care. He says he does not want to follow the Conservatives and start setting one generation against another. He is not blaming the old, he says. They have made a fantastic contribution. But he says it is also true that it is not the fault of the young that public services are under pressure and that the government’s finances are in deficit. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking in Scarborough. He says this is the 52nd event that he has done, and he says all the time the crowds he is attracting are getting bigger and bigger. Here are the tables for the latest Guardian/ICM poll (pdf). Here is the headline George Osborne selected for the first edition of the Evening Standard. His second edition splash headline is considerably sharper. (Good job Theresa May claims she hardly ever reads it - see 10.34am.) There is no one alive who knows more about British elections than Sir David Butler, who has just joined Twitter, despite being in his 90s. He says today’s U-turn is unprecedented. Several local Conservative activists who attended the Welsh Conservative manifesto launch at the memorial hall in the village of Gresford told reporters afterwards that they were pleased to see the robust questioning of the prime minister on social care. One local activist, who did not want to be named, said he thought the policy was imbalanced. “I’ve had family die of dementia and of cancer. I’ve also worked all my life to pass on what I’ve worked for to my children. I’d be devastated if it all had to go on care after I die, but this way it’s a lottery,” he said. “It does seem like the balance isn’t quite right.” The Scottish Labour party has predicted that Holyrood would be at least £3bn better off if Jeremy Corbyn boosted public spending after the general election. Kezia Dugdale, the party’s Scottish leader, said electing a Corbyn government would lead to a transformation and “massive investment” in public services as she launched Labour’s Scottish manifesto in Edinburgh. Party officials handed out a detailed breakdown of Corbyn’s manifesto pledges to spend at least £42bn, chiefly on policies for England and Wales such as abolishing tuition fees, scrapping the public sector pay cap and expanding free childcare. They said that under the Treasury’s spending formula developed by Lord Barnett, that would see £3.1bn in so-called “Barnett consequentials” flow to the Scottish parliament over the lifetime of the next UK government. In an explicit endorsement of Corbyn’s spending pledges, Dugdale appealed to Scottish National party voters to back Labour’s plan for what she said would be a fairer, more equal country. Dugdale publicly opposed Corbyn’s leadership bids, and mentioned him by name once in her 2,500 word speech, but she described the party’s manifesto as “bold, ambitious and radical [in] the finest traditions of the Labour movement”. We’ve got a new, daily election podcast. Here is today’s, featuring Jonathan Freedland, Owen Jones and Zoe Williams. Four polls come out at the weekend, and they all showed the Conservative lead over Labour narrowing after the publication of the manifesto. The figures were widely seen as evidence that the Tory social care plans had backfired (presumably by Theresa May too, given her announcement today.) We’ve now got the results of this week’s Guardian/ICM survey, and it also shows Labour making advances. Here are the figures. Conservatives: 47% (down 1 from Guardian/ICM last week) Labour: 33% (up 5) Lib Dems: 9% (down 1) Ukip: 4% (down 2) Greens: 2% (down 1) Conservative lead: 14 points (down 6) Martin Boon, ICM’s director, says these figures support claims Labour won the manifesto battle. Here is his take on the figures: After the delivery of the party manifestos, polling over the weekend has indicated a resurgent, if still rather distant Labour party. ICM has been the stickiest pollster for the Tories, and while we probably still are, our poll today reinforces the impression that Labour have won the short-term manifesto battle. They rise to 33%, up five points on last week, while the Tories drop a point to stand on (a still heady) 47%. The Tories have had a flat out bad weekend, and the wind does feel as if it’s suddenly blowing in a different direction, but we’ve seen short-term effects like this before, and we’ve seen them dissipate. This is still a massive 14-point Tory lead, and still their election to throw away. It is almost a whole year since ICM last saw Labour on 33% (June 2016), so it’s a surge that has been a long time coming. However, it does not arise in conjunction with a precipitous Tory collapse, and their 47% remains a number that the party will be wholly delighted with. Electoral Calculus predict an overall majority of 134, with the Tories only just shy of 400 seats. Labour do recover to 177, largely because their polling in their own marginal seats is much improved: a deficit of only three points compared to 17-20 points that we have seen in such places on ICM’s recent polls. It’s a step in the right direction. Ukip drop to 4%, the lowest online share we have ever allocated to the party. This is partly the result of a methodology change. ICM is able to systematically allocate every respondent to their political constituency via their full postcode, so this week we built into the interview software constituency-level information that precluded Ukip as a party to vote for in those seats where they are not standing a candidate (thus forcing people living in such places to make an alternative choice). We believe this is a good addition to our polling methods; it will explain part of the further Ukip drop but perhaps not all of it. ICM interviewed 2,004 adults aged 18+ online, on 19-21 May 2017. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. UPDATE: Here are the tables for the poll (pdf). According to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, the Tories are now claiming they never ruled out a cap on social care costs - only the Dilnot version of the cap. At the last election the Tories promised to implement the recommendation from the Dilnot commission for a cap on social care costs (although at a level much higher than that originally proposed by Andrew Dilnot). But after the election David Cameron’s government said implementation would be delayed until 2020. Last week’s manifesto implied that the Dilnot plans were dead, but today’s announcement suggests they may get a new lease of life. In its manifesto Labour proposed increasing the social care budget by £8bn over the course of the next parliament. The manifesto also says Labour would impose a cap on the maximum amount people have to pay for their care, as well as raising the “floor”, the sum people are allowed to keep when all their assets have been used up. Today’s announcement means that the Tories have now on these issues effectively adopted Labour policy. Labour said their plans would cost £3bn a year. The Tories have not costed their version. This is from the Labour manifesto. In its first years, our service will require an additional £3bn of public funds every year, enough to place a maximum limit on lifetime personal contributions to care costs, raise the asset threshold below which people are entitled to state support, and provide free end of life care. There are different ways the necessary monies can be raised. We will seek consensus on a cross-party basis about how it should be funded, with options including wealth taxes, an employer care contribution or a new social care levy. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said about the Tory U-turn at the Labour event in Hull. A Tory U-turn on social care would be extremely welcome because I want this country to face up to its responsibilities to those who need care, either frail elderly, those with special needs, those with severe disabilities, those with learning difficulties. And our proposals are that we will refund social care, putting emergency money into it, so that a million people waiting for social care don’t wait. And we won’t get involved in this horrible policy that the Tories have put forward which will actually damage families and family income, damage people, break up relationships, all kinds of horrible things will happen from this very dangerously ill-thought out social care policy. And if George Osborne is at last doing something useful in his life of supporting proper funding for social care, then thank you George for that. And I urge him to read very carefully [what] our manifesto says on social care. Corbyn also said a “dementia tax” would be “horrible”. Here is Andrew Gwynne, Labour’s election coordinator, on the Tory U-turn. Theresa May has thrown her own election campaign into chaos and confusion. She is unable to stick to her own manifesto for more than four days. And by failing to put a figure for a cap on social care costs, she has only added to the uncertainty for millions of older people and their families. This is weak and unstable leadership. You can’t trust the Tories - if this is how they handle their own manifesto, how will they cope with the Brexit negotiations? Oh dear. Last week Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, said explicitly that the Tories were dropping plans for a cap on the social care costs that people would have to pay. No one can say anymore that this election is boring. This was a remarkable announcement, because there is no precedent in recent years for a party having to rewrite a major manifesto so completely and so quickly during an election campaign. The best that can be said for May’s move is that, if you are going to have to perform a policy U-turn, it is best to get it over and done with quickly. A day’s embarrassment is well worth putting up with if it results in policy on a major issue ending up in a place where it is defensible and not haemorrhaging votes, which is what the social care policy seemed to be doing. The Tories abandoned one of the biggest items in their budget earlier this year (the increase in national insurance for the self-employed) and, although that led to dire headlines on the day, it did not destroy the Conservative lead over Labour on the issue of economic competence. It is also worth remembering that dramatic campaign moments (e.g. Gordon Brown and Gillian Duffy) often have less impact on an election result than observers assume at the time. That said, it has been an awful morning for May - possibly her worst as prime minister. During the Q&amp;A after her speech she came close to losing her composure, and the footage of her, voice rising, claiming “nothing has changed” (as she confirmed that it has) was an image consultant’s nightmare. In particular, she has inflicted serious damage on the “May brand” in three ways. 1 - May does not look so “strong and stable” anymore. Until the manifesto came out, “strong and stable leadership” was almost the entire Conservative campaign. Even today, May was pushing this message strongly. (See 10.34am.) Now it looks far less plausible. 2 - This undermines the Tories’ reputation for financial competence. Imposing a cap on social care costs will significantly increase the costs of social care, probably by a matter of billions per year over the next decade. But we don’t know by how much, because the Tories never gave any indication of how much their plans were expected to raise when they announced them last week, and they are not giving any clue as to what level the cap will be imposed at. The Labour party would be crucified if it made policy in such a costings vacuum. 3 - May was remarkably dishonest when she tried to defend her U-turn. After calling an election when she said she wouldn’t, May’s claim to be a straightforward and reliable politician was open to challenge, but today she waded fully into Pinocchio territory. She claimed this morning that she was only having to clarify her position because Labour and Jeremy Corbyn had been making “fake claims” about the manifesto. But this is simply not true; the Labour claims about a “dementia tax” have been based on a tendentious but accurate assumption about what the plans announced last week would mean. (May seemed to imply that a cap on social care costs was implied in what the manifesto said last week, if not stated explicitly, but this is not true; the manifesto said the plans for a floor not a cap on costs - see 11.57am - were “more equitable, within and across the generations, than the proposals following the Dilnot report [Dilnot proposed a cap], which mostly benefited a small number of wealthier people.) May is right to say her manifesto plans would not mean people losing their home while they are alive, and in her head she may be using this to justify her claim that her plans were being misrepresented. But Labour has not been saying people would lose their homes while still alive. At the Labour launch Jeremy Corbyn welcomes the U-turn. He says that if George Osborne is now doing something useful with his life, that is to be welcomed. Q: Someone with dementia will have to use up their inheritance. But someone who dies of cancer will be able to pass on £1m because you have raised the inheritance tax threshold. So it is a dementia tax. How is that fair? May is shaking her head as the question gets asked, objecting to the term dementia tax. She says the questioner (my colleague Jessica Elgot) is using a term used by the Labour party. Q: Will anything else in the manifesto change? May says nothing has changed. She says she has offered a sustainable solution to the problem of social care. Q: Why did you grant asylum to the man arrested for the killing of Yvonne Fletcher? May says there are rules that apply to the granting of asylum. May invites a question from the Daily Post (the north Wales paper). Q: What guarantees can you give to farmers? May says the government will devise its own system of support for farmers. It will be devised by us, not someone else. Q: [From Channel 4 News’ Michael Crick] I don’t recall another election manifesto U-turn. The lady is for turning. Doesn’t this show you are wobbly. What will the cap be? £100,000, £200,000, £500,000? May says she has not changed the principles behind what she is proposing. Q: You have buckled under pressure. Isn’t this just an attempt to save votes? May says she has been clear about the principles that will apply. But she has clarified now that there will be an upper limit people will have to pay. She says she is lifting the amount that people can keep to four times the level it is now. This will produce a sustainable solution, she says. Q: Isn’t this a manifesto of chaos now? What else will you qualify in the next few days? And what message does it send out to EU leaders, that you are prepared to budge? May says this shows she is prepared to take tough decisions. People have a choice, between Jeremy Corbyn and his coalition of chaos, and a government led by her, which has a plan to fix things. Q: [From the BBC’s Laura Kuennsberg] You say Corbyn is indecisive. But you have announced a major change to your manifesto. That is not strong and stable, is it. And where will the cap be imposed? May says she is setting out a long-term plan for addressing the social care crisis. We have to start dealing with this now. The plans are clear in the manifesto. We said we would issue a green paper, she says. And of course we will consult on the plans. May says Corbyn has claimed elderly people will have to lose their homes. No one will have to lose their family home while they are alive, she says. Those are the proposals she is putting forward, she says. May’s claim that her manifesto plans on social care were subject to “fake claims made by Jeremy Corbyn” (see 11.48am) is not true. This is what the manifesto said about social care. It promised a “floor” for costs - a maximum that people would be allowed to retain, when they are paying their care costs, so that people would be allowed to keep their last £100,000. But it did not propose a “cap”, a maximum amount that people would have to spend. Corbyn’s claim that this would lead to some people pay more was entirely correct. For the record, this is what the Tory manifesto said. Under the current system, care costs deplete an individual’s assets, including in some cases the family home, down to £23,250 or even less. These costs can be catastrophic for those with modest or medium wealth. One purpose of long-term saving is to cover needs in old age; those who can should rightly contribute to their care from savings and accumulated wealth, rather than expecting current and future taxpayers to carry the cost on their behalf. Moreover, many older people have built considerable property assets due to rising property prices. Reconciling these competing pressures fairly and in a sustainable way has challenged many governments of the past. We intend to tackle this with three connected measures. First, we will align the future basis for means-testing for domiciliary care with that for residential care, so that people are looked after in the place that is best for them. This will mean that the value of the family home will be taken into account along with other assets and income, whether care is provided at home, or in a residential or nursing care home. Second, to ensure this is fair, we will introduce a single capital floor, set at £100,000, more than four times the current means test threshold. This will ensure that, no matter how large the cost of care turns out to be, people will always retain at least £100,000 of their savings and assets, including value in the family home. Third, we will extend the current freedom to defer payments for residential care to those receiving care at home, so no-one will have to sell their home in their lifetime to pay for care. May goes on: But since my manifesto was published, the proposals have been subject to fake claims made by Jeremy Corbyn. The only things he has left to offer in this campaign are fake claims, fear and scare-mongering. So I want to make a further point clear. This manifesto says that we will come forward with a consultation paper, a government green paper. And that consultation will include an absolute limit on the amount people have to pay for their care costs. So let me reiterate. We are proposing the right funding model for social care. We will make sure nobody has to sell their family home to pay for care. We will make sure there’s an absolute limit on what people need to pay. And you will never have to go below £100,000 of your savings, so you will always have something to pass on to your family. And what is Jeremy Corbyn’s plan? He can promise a nonsensical, fantasy policy that can only be funded through massive tax rises on younger generations. In fact, just recently he threatened to increase the basic rate of income tax for millions of people from 20 to 25 per cent to fund social care. That tells you everything you need to know about Jeremy Corbyn’s answer to the problem. The alternative is that he sticks to the status quo, which too often provides poor care and leaves old and vulnerable people having to sell their family homes. This manifesto provides a better way. With it I’m leading Britain, while Mr Corbyn is simply scaremongering among the elderly and the vulnerable. May says Labour has been falsely claiming that people will lose their homes from the Tories’ social care policy. So she wants to clarify the position, she says. So today I want to put an end to Jeremy Corbyn’s fake claims and clarify any doubts about our social care policy and the family home. My manifesto is honest and upfront about our challenges. It includes plans to strengthen the social care system with more and sustainable funding to cope with the long-term pressures caused by the fact that we are an ageing society. Jeremy Corbyn wants to duck this reality - and play politics. But there will be 2 million more people over 75 years old in Britain over the next decade alone. Our social care system will collapse unless we make some important decisions now about how we fund it. That is why we have to act. And it is why – to give people security – we included in our plans measures to make sure nobody has to sell the family home to pay for care. And we also said that we would protect £100,000 of your savings so, however expensive your care, you can pass something on to your family. Let’s be clear. This plan replaces the existing system where people often get poor quality care - and stand to lose almost all their savings and assets, including the family home. This plan addresses the worry people have when they have a loved one with a long-term condition, and they don’t know how they’re going to afford to care for them. So these are good and sensible plans. They provide the beginning of a solution to social care without increasing taxes on younger generations. And, I should say, we are the only party in this election prepared to face up to the reality of our ageing society and offer a long-term solution. George Osborne has tweeted the Evening Standard front page. This is what the Welsh Conservative manifesto says about social care. May says some Welsh constituencies have returned Labour MPs for more than a century. Labour thinks it is entitled to power, she says. But she says services in Wales are poor. Schools are falling further and further behind, and the NHS is under-performing, she says. May says the manifesto is a mainstream manifesto from a mainstream party determined to deliver for Britain. Theresa May is speaking in Wrexham now. She starts with the material about Brexit I flagged up earlier. (See 10.34am.) On The Andrew Marr Show yesterday (pdf) Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, was asked: “Is there any chance at all you’re going to look at it [the social care policy] again?” Green replied: No. What we said in the manifesto incidentally, just to put that no in context, is that we have set out this policy which we’re not going to look at again. If May does announce a U-turn, as Sky and the Evening Standard are expecting (and we are not being told they are wrong), Green is going to find himself looking a bit daft. He will be in the same position as Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who had to drop plans to raise national insurance for the self-employed less than a week after announing them in the budget. An anti-fox hunting protester has been arrested as the prime minister’s car arrived in Wrexham ahead of the launch of the Conservative manifesto. The man, who told reporters his name was Connor, waved a black flag and yelled “this is a fascist state, Theresa May’s police state”. He was then dragged to the ground by police as May’s motorcade swept past. Blowing a horn, he attempted to move towards the car before he was tackled and pulled away, surrounded by hoards of photographers and journalists. Two other protesters followed to demand to know the reason why he had been arrested. “This is a peaceful protest, you’ve no right to arrest him,” said one, who told the Guardian his name was Cookie. “We see foxes killed every day, the ban isn’t enforced, every day just down the road, she doesn’t care about wildlife,” another protester said. Sky’s Faisal Islam says the Conservatives’ green paper on social care, due after the election, will include plans for a cap. He says the Tories do not accept that this is a U-turn - although, given that last week the Tories were ruling out a cap, most commentators will say that’s exactly what it is. Theresa May is due to speak at the launch of the Welsh Conservatives’ manifesto imminently. She is likely to say more on this then. George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor who now edits the Evening Standard, says the government will perform a U-turn over social care, and impose a cap on costs. Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, have been in Hull this morning (the 2017 city of culture) to announce plans for a £1bn cultural capital fund. This is what the party is saying about its plans in a news release. Labour announces today that a £1bn culture capital fund will invest in ‘creative clusters’ across the country. Labour will guarantee a creative future for all by: Establishing a £1bn cultural capital fund to support our world-leading cultural industries, which have been badly hit by Tory cuts. The fund will be one of the largest arts infrastructure funds ever created. It will give the country’s creative sectors an opportunity to bid for extra funding and help the UK protect its status as a creative and cultural hub in the digital age. It will protect and invest in live music venues in order to support grassroots and professional music and ensure there is a vibrant music industry in all parts of the country. Labour will review the business rates system and extend the £1,000 pub relief to help small music venues that have been hit by rate rises. Ensuring museums and art galleries remain free and invest in our heritage sector, which is central to the identity and economy of local communities across the country. Introducing a £160m arts pupil premium for every primary school in England to boost creative education and ensure state schools have arts facilities of an equivalent standard to those available in many private schools. Bartley says it is disappointing that the Labour and Lib Dem leaders rejected calls for a “progressive alliance”. But in some seats there have been deals, he says. The Green party is ahead of the curve, he says. He says this is only the start. And that’s it. The launch is over. My colleague Peter Walker will be filing more on it soon. Lucas says, even if President Trump turns his back on the Paris climate change agreement, there is enough support for action against climate change around the world to ensure that the agreement survives. Lucas says the Greens would not extend the Brexit negotiations. But the Greens want the public, not parliament, to have the final say on the Brexit deal. We have seen many Brexit policies unravelling, for example, such as the promised £350m extra a year for the NHS. Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley, the Green party co-leaders, are now taking questions. Q: Aren’t your policies similar to Labour’s? Lucas says they are. Imitation is the biggest form of flattery, she says. But she says there is a key difference on Europe. Labour would offer the Tories a blank cheque on Brexit, she says. The Green party is launching its manifesto. There are details here, on the party’s website. My colleague Peter Walker is there. Later this morning Theresa May will be speaking at the launch of the Welsh Conservative manifesto, and some extracts from her speech have been released in advance. Often these overnight releases are fairly anodyne, but there are some interesting lines in what May will say. May will condemn politicians for issuing “hysterical warnings” about Brexit. And she appears to praise the Welsh for ignoring them. She will say: Because too often in the past, ordinary working people have found the help and support they need just isn’t there. And I know that sense of disenchantment is particularly acute here in Wales. We saw that when people here in Wrexham and across Wales chose to ignore the hysterical warnings of Labour, Plaid Cymru and Liberal Democrat politicians in Cardiff Bay, and voted to leave the EU. In the extracts we’ve seen, May forgets to mention that she also warned people not to vote for Brexit – although, to be fair, her arguments against leaving the EU were measured, and she said the sky would not fall in if the UK did leave. This line could also be seen as a dig at George Osborne, whose claim that Brexit would necessitate an emergency, tax-raising budget during the EU referendum campaign was also seen as hysterical. May sacked Osborne when she became PM and does not seem to feel any warmer about him now. There was a sly dig in her Times interview on Saturday, (paywall) when May, asked about the Evening Standard, now edited by Osborne, replied: “I have to confess, absolutely honestly, [I have] only ever in my life occasionally flicked through the Evening Standard.” She says that the UK must be represented in the Brexit talks by someone “100% committed to the cause”. Because our future prosperity depends on getting the next five years right. That is why we need someone representing Britain who is 100% committed to the cause. Not someone who is uncertain or unsure, but someone utterly determined to deliver the democratic will of the British people. May, of course, voted for the UK to stay in the EU. Until recently, when asked in interviews whether she has changed her mind about Brexit and now thinks it is a good idea, or whether she still thinks it is bad idea but is just going along with it anyway, she has dodged the question, saying that because people voted for Brexit, it must happen, and that the important thing is to make it work. But, increasingly, May is starting to sound like a true believer. In the Commons earlier this year she said that staying in the single market would effectively mean staying in the EU, a Ukip argument that no remain supporter would accept. At her press conference last week she refused to accept that Brexit was to blame for the slump in sterling that has pushed up inflation, hitting living standards; this is remain orthodoxy, and at least 90% true, but an uncomfortable fact for leave true believers to accept. And now she is saying she is “100% committed to the cause”. She urges people to vote Tory to stop Jeremy Corbyn being at the “negotiating table” for the Brexit talks. She mentions the prospect of Corbyn being at the “negotiating table” or in the “negotiating chamber” twice. For example, she says: Just 11 days after that the European Union wants the Brexit negotiations to begin. The UK’s seat at the negotiating table will be filled by me or Jeremy Corbyn. The deal we seek will be negotiated by me or Jeremy Corbyn. There is nothing particularly new about this, because May has conjured up this image repeatedly in her standard stump speech. But today’s comments suggest she is redoubling efforts to put the image of Corbyn on the train to Brussels to negotiate on behalf of the UK in the minds of voters. If you want to know why, read this, from Lord Ashcroft’s latest account of what focus groups are saying about the election. It is from focus groups conducted in three Labour-held seats in the north of England. Those with doubts [about Labour] – particularly those previous Labour supporters who had voted leave last year – kept coming back to one point: “I would have voted Labour as per usual but I’m not sure that gentleman is the right one to go into the negotiations on coming out.” For some distressed remainers, it hardly mattered who was speaking for Britain (“We’ll get what we’re given. We’re outnumbered, we’re in a parlous position. We’ll rue the day, whoever is leading the so-called negotiations”), but for many others, which team would represent the country was the single biggest point at stake: “That’s the main thing for me that may swing me from Labour to Conservative”; “Brexit plays a part because there’s been nothing mentioned that I’ve seen about if Labour do get in, what are their plans? At least Theresa May is putting a plan into place.” Ukip are holding a press conference this morning, about protecting the older generation. But, as the Sun’s Harry Cole says, press interest isn’t exactly high. I’ll post some more about it when I’ve got an account of what was said. Theresa May already has a reputation for talking the pound down, and the Conservative party manifesto is reinforcing it this morning. Sterling has fallen by almost 0.5% against the US dollar in early trading, falling to $1.297, having hit a seven-month high last week. The backlash against the PM’s proposals for social care, and opinion polls showing the Tory lead narrowing to nine points, is causing some anxiety in the City this morning. Investors are rethinking their assumption that May would secure a landslide win, giving her a stronger hand to deliver a “smooth Brexit”. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the pound is suffering because May’s manifesto has “gone down like a lead balloon” with core voters. She adds: While a nine-point lead could still give Theresa May a comfortable victory on 8 June, the fact her lead has been slashed in half in just a few days may reinforce to financial markets that her victory is not a certainty. With three weeks to go before the election, another bad PR week for PM May and her team and the Tories’ lead over Labour could fall further into the low single figures, which could encourage sterling selling ahead of this crucial vote. This is from Howard Archer, economist at data firm IHS Markit: Back in early October, the pound tumbled by 1% when May announced she would trigger article 50 by the end of March this year. Sterling then suffered a mysterious ‘flash crash’ just days after the Tory party conference, where ministers signalled that a hard Brexit was likely. Fast-forward to early January, and the pound was knocked back to just $1.21 after May insisted that Britain couldn’t hold on to parts of its EU membership. It fell further ahead of the PM’s Lancaster House speech, where she declared that Britain would leave the single market (but rallied once the speech was actually delivered). There is more on the business live blog. Just to make things complicated, even though the FT splash headline (see 8.38am) is using the term “dementia tax” (in recognition of the fact that this is a term that is sticking), the FT’s editor Lional Barber has tweeted an article to an FT article by Merryn Somerset Webb, the editor-in-chief of MoneyWeek, saying the plan to charge some homeowners more if the need care in their own home is not a tax. Here’s an extract from the article. It isn’t a tax. One smarty pants started referring to the policy online as the “dementia tax”. That’s clever, but also nonsense. A tax is a cash contribution to the state’s coffers, taken directly from your income or tacked on to the cost of something you buy. It is money to be pooled to finance the needs of the population as a whole. This instead is simply a system that helps you pay for your own needs with your own money. Start adding “tax” to the description of everything you pay for out of your net income and life quickly gets a bit silly. You pay for your own pants rather than contributing to a hypothecated underwear fund on an annual basis. But do you feel peeved about the “knicker tax” every time you go into M&amp;S? I suspect not. And here is her verdict on why she backs the Tory policy. It is a simple solution to the ongoing problem of the cost of care. It is a neat political way to marry individual responsibility and state support. It is also an exposure of the biggest lie in British politics: that national insurance is a separate levy which is set aside to pay for this kind of thing. It isn’t. Anyone who starts a conversation about social care with “I’ve paid in all my life” needs to get this. And finally it is a happy recognition that while there aren’t many problems in the UK to which high house prices are the obvious answer, there are some. Financing social care is one of them. In an interview with BBC Breakfast Angela Rayner also played down the significance of the Conservative attacks on Jeremy Corbyn over the terms in which he chose to condemn IRA bombing in an interview yesterday. I think it’s a bit of a dead cat because the Conservatives know that at the moment they are on the rack, because they are trying to bring in a dementia tax which will hurt older people. Jeremy Corbyn on Sophy Ridge did condemn the bombing (by the) IRA, he did condemn that bombing and he was quite clear about that. Labour have got a proud record, under Tony Blair we brought about the peace process in Northern Ireland. Jeremy has been absolutely clear, he condemns the bombing by the IRA in Northern Ireland and we want to continue to see that peace process flourish. A “dead cat” is a distraction technique. It is a reference to a metaphor used by the Tory election strategist Lynton Crosby to describe the maneouvre. (Not to be confused with a “dead cat bounce”, which is something different.) Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, gave an interview to Sky News this morning, as well as to the Today programme. (See 7.35am.) On Sky she was asked about the people Theresa May named as her dream dinner party guests in a Sunday Telegraph interview, and whether she was disappointed not to be on the list. She replied: I’m not surprised at all. Theresa May often looks at me and sneers when I see her opposite the dispatch box, so I’m not surprised she wouldn’t want me at her dinner party, to be honest. I’m probably not posh enough. The Conservatives are losing the battle to get people to stop calling their plans for social care a “dementia tax”. As the Independent’s Jon Stone points out, if the FT is calling it that, than that’s as good as official. As Guardian Politics points out on Twitter, the Tories are trying to counter this using Google advertising. Clegg says the first-past-the-post system is “loopy”. At the last election almost 4m people voted for Ukip, “and all they got for that was Douglas Carswell” (ie, just one MP). Clegg says people have more control over their daily lives. Yet politics is still slow and archaic. But he says he wants to speak up for politicians. British MPs make themselves available to their constituents. Compared with politicians in other countries, they spend much more time making themselves available to citizens. He hopes that does not change. Here is Sarah Sands, the new Today editor, explaining why Nick Clegg is being interviewed. Clegg says young people voted in overwhelming numbers last year. They have been ignored. Brexit is an act of generational theft, he says. John Humphrys is interviewing Nick Clegg. The interview is focusing on voter turnout. Q: It’s your fault, isn’t it? (Clegg was in charge of constitutional reform in the coalition government) Clegg says politicians always get blamed. We were told the election would be about Brexit. But Theresa May only wants to talk about herself, and Jeremy Corbyn wants to talk about anything but Brexit. He says elections have become a form of displacement activity. Q: People say politicians make promises they don’t keep, as you did over tuition fees. Clegg accepts that. He says Labour is now promising lots of goodies. Q: Presumably you approve of the Labour policy. Clegg says Labour introduced them in the first place. He says he does not think Labour could pay for its promise. And he thinks it is the wrong choice now. It would cost £9bn, with some of the money coming from people who don’t go to university. And Labour is not reversing all the benefits cuts. He says he would make that his priority, not getting rid of tuition fees. Clegg claims Labour could not fund its latest tuition fee abolition policy. Good morning. I’m taking over from Claire. Nick Clegg is about to be interviewed on the Today programme. I’m handing over the live blog now to Andrew Sparrow to steer you through the rest of the day. To have the Snap election briefing deposited in your inbox tomorrow, and every weekday, morning, do sign up here. Sinn Féin’s John O’Dowd has been speaking to the Today programme; the party launches its manifesto today, though its MPs do not take up their seats in Westminster. A central part of Sinn Féin’s manifesto is concern over the future of the soft border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic once Brexit happens. It is calling for NI to have an “EU-designated special status” that would retain a link between the two. O’Dowd says: The EU played a role in bringing that conflict to an end … What we’re seeking is continued representation in the European parliament under the north-south ministerial council … that we’d still be able to access council meetings, that we’d still be able to access funding. Access to the European court of justice would be part of any deal, he says. He says such a move would not mean there would need to be a border poll, though Sinn Féin of course still supports such a referendum: We’re not suggesting at this stage that sovereignty would change. Rather, he says, it reflects the fact that Northern Ireland did not vote leave: The majority of people here voted to stay within the EU – that vote was across unionism and nationalism. And he says there’ll be no change to the policy of not taking up Westminster seats: Westminster is not a listening bureau … There is no example I can look at … where Irish nationalists have been able to influence the actions in Westminster. People could get a universal basic income and a shorter working week under plans to be proposed by the Green party on Monday. Caroline Lucas, the party’s co-leader, said the proposals were “big, bold ideas to create a confident and caring country we can all be proud of”. The party’s flagship pledges, called their “green guarantee”, would reverse the privatisation of the NHS and fill the funding gap in the health service, paid for partly by scrapping the UK’s Trident nuclear deterrent. It would also promise another referendum when Britain strikes its Brexit deal and guarantee EU citizens rights. But its most radical proposals are a promise to work towards the introduction of a universal basic income – a flat rate paid to everyone whether or not they are in work. A universal basic income is regarded by some on the left as a response to the robotisation of the workforce, which it is feared could replace lower-skilled jobs and exacerbate inequality The Greens said the proposal would initially take the form of a government-sponsored pilot scheme and the phasing in a of a shorter working week. And with Labour having promised to scrap university tuition fees if elected, the Greens last week went one step further, with a pledge to write off all existing student loan debts, at a cost of more than £14bn over the next parliament. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, has been speaking to the Today programme about the tuition fee pledge. She confirms: As of September, students going to university will not pay tuition fees. Rayner says that adds up to a cost of £9.5bn annually, or £11.2bn if you add in maintenance grants: We believe that’s a small price to pay for ensuring young people are not saddled with £45,000 in debt. She says Labour has accounted for this in its manifesto: That extra money is within the overall costings that we have … The Conservatives have not produced any costings. We’re quite clear in ours … There is room within that. Having promised to scrap fees, it had to be done as soon as possible, Rayner says: We don’t want students to defer from this year. Against accusations that scrapping fees for all students actually benefits the better-off, Rayner says that even if fees are not paid back (if the graduate does not meet the earnings threshold) it still has a negative effect: The most disadvantaged students … have this hanging over their heads for longer. If you’ve ever had a huge amount of debt hanging over your head, you know how that feels. With the deadline tonight for voters to register for the 8 June election, the Electoral Commission says 15% of those eligible – that’s 7 million people – are not signed up. It says more than 2.3m applications to register have been received since the snap election was called – although some of those people will already have been on the electoral roll. Last year, as the midnight cut-off to register for the EU referendum approach, the website crashed as last-minute applications surged, forcing an extension to the deadline. Those who haven’t yet put their names down (and I’m going to guess that most readers of a politics live blog have done so), can do it online here. That’s not for readers in Northern Ireland, unfortunately: you’ll need to download a form from this site and take it to your local area electoral office. Jeremy Corbyn will say today that under a Labour government, university tuition fees would effectively be scrapped from autumn this year. Effectively because legislation to abolish the fees wouldn’t be implemented before the start of the academic year, but for the year starting autumn 2018. Mindful that that could lead to a stampede of deferments from this year’s intake – as well as a few “not fair”s – Corbyn will say that students starting courses this year would have their first tranche of fees retrospectively written off. Those already studying would not have to pay from autumn 2018 onwards. Labour is hoping that today’s announcement will bounce more young people into registering to vote: the deadline is 11.59pm today and you can sign up here. Welcome back to the antepenultimate week of campaigning – and the last day on which you can register to vote – before polling day. I’m Claire Phipps with your whip-through of the morning’s election news; Andrew Sparrow picks up the live blog later. Do join us in the comments or on Twitter @Claire_Phipps. What’s happening? It turns out there was something Theresa May could do to prod her polling lead over Jeremy Corbyn down to single figures, and that something was the manifesto commitment to require older people to fund their own social care from all assets over £100,000. Or, as it’s become more snappily if not cheerily nicknamed, the dementia tax. Labour leaflets have swiftly sprung up promising to “fight the Tories’ unfair dementia tax”, and Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has labelled it “Theresa May’s poll tax”, amid warnings the proposal is unworkable and chatter that the proposal is not playing well on the doorstep – up to now the PM’s safe space. Lurching to its defence yesterday came foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who said the policy was not set in stone (“I do understand people’s reservations … there will be a consultation on getting it right”); and work and pensions secretary Damian Green, who said it was (“We have set out this policy, which we’re not going to look at again.”). Who to believe? Given that Johnson clearly attended an alternate Conservative launch, with a manifesto that included within its pages the bus-tastic £350m a a week for the NHS – “It is. It is. Theresa May, she said it at the launch of the manifesto,” he burbled yesterday – we can probably place his assurances in the piffle pile. With reports that cabinet ministers were not told about the plans much before the ferociously upbeat “you don’t have to sell your house! (until you’re dead)” pre-briefings for the manifesto, perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised that they’re still a little hazy on it. Certainly, the PM forgot to mention the social care policy in her lengthy Facebook post comparing her own manifesto with Labour’s, “written and shaped by a leader who doesn’t understand – or like – our country”. Time, surely, to sound the red, white and blue Brexit klaxon. May will be in Wales today, instructing voters that, with talks on Britain’s EU exit due to begin less than a fortnight after the election: There will be no time to waste and no time for a new government to find its way. So the stakes in this election are high. So tricky, isn’t it, when an election just happens to fall right before such a key date? Brexit also dominated last night’s BBC debate in Scotland, as six party leaders who (mostly) are not standing for Westminster election tussled over what would happen to a country that didn’t vote to leave the EU. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson accused her SNP counterpart of not knowing her place: Nicola Sturgeon says she wants a seat at the Brexit table, but she wants Scotland to be out of the UK and into the eurozone. I ask myself, which side of the table does she want to be sat on? But Sturgeon wasn’t engaging in this musical chairs without an adversary, pointing out that Davidson had been a remainer, then a fan of Scotland staying in the single market, before converting enthusiastically to the harder Tory line: First she said we needed a seat at the negotiating table and now she has changed her mind. It seems to me that Ruth Davidson does everything that Theresa May tells her to do. Scottish Labour – wilting in the Scotland-wide polls in third place on 19% – will launch its manifesto today (along with its Welsh counterpart, the Welsh Conservatives, Sinn Féin and the UK Greens, who are heralding a universal basic income). Jeremy Corbyn has more to trumpet today, too, with an enticement that a Labour government could scrap university fees as early as this autumn, and plans for a £1bn fund to invest in the arts. He previewed this with an appearance at the Wirral Live music festival, opening for the Libertines with a selection of his greatest hits. It went better than his appearance on Sky News on Sunday, where some of his older material got an airing. Did he condemn the IRA? After five or so feints, he went with a yes: I condemn all the bombings by both the loyalists and the IRA. It can be hard to keep track of what politicians believed then and now. Take the PM. Only last year, it seems, she was a remainer. But today she’ll praise the vote-leavers of Wales for paying no heed to all those naysayers: People here in Wrexham and across Wales chose to ignore the hysterical warnings of Labour, Plaid Cymru and Liberal Democrat politicians in Cardiff Bay, and voted to leave the EU. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies did urge a vote to leave. But those who can raid their memories of 2016 might recall some – even quite prominent – Tories on the side of those “hysterical” warning-mongers. At a glance: NHS funding pledges by major parties would still fall short, experts say. Labour risks losing more minority ethnic voters to Tories, study finds. Candidates hold one-hour pause in campaigning to remember Jo Cox. Frank Field: if Labour loses, a new leader must be chosen by the PLP alone – with Corbyn’s manifesto as the starting point. Poll position Weekend polling – and a fresh survey this morning – show the Tory lead over Labour is thinning. A telephone poll by Survation for ITV’s Good Morning Britain, published today, puts that lead at nine points: half what it was a week ago. The Conservatives have mislaid five points to 43%, with Labour perking up five to 34%, and the Lib Dems right where they were on 8%. YouGov for the Sunday Times also pegged the lead at nine points, with Team Theresa May down one point to 44% in the wake of the manifesto, and Labour up three to 35%. But elsewhere, it was still a double-figure lead. A separate Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday had a 12-point advantage (46% v 34%), as did ORB for the Sunday Telegraph, on the same percentages. An Observer/Opinium poll has it at 13 points: that’s down six for the Tories from last month and up seven for Labour. The Lib Dems don’t crack double digits in any of them. Diary An ostentation of manifestos today: the “Green guarantee” with co-leaders Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley at 10.30am in London; Kezia Dugdale presents the Scottish Labour version at 11am in Edinburgh; the Welsh Conservatives’ launch in Wrexham follows swiftly after that, guest-starring Theresa May; then it’s Flintshire at 12.30 for Carwyn Jones’ revelation of the Welsh Labour paperwork. Sinn Féin also spells out its plans today. Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson are in Hull, the 2017 city of culture, for their arts manifesto. At 7pm, Andrew Neil interviews Theresa May on BBC1. Read these In the Guardian, Gary Younge says Corbyn is now Labour’s best hope for the future: Herein lies one of the two key problems with the ‘anybody but Corbyn’ brigade. First, they don’t have ‘anybody’. Corbyn’s leadership does come up on the doorstep as a problem – but Owen Smith or Liz Kendall do not come up as solutions. There is no charismatic standard-bearer waiting in the wings. Second, even if they did have a candidate, they do not have an agenda. For a while it wasn’t obvious that Corbyn did either… The manifesto has had an almost therapeutic effect. Beyond reintroducing basic social democratic policies to the arena, it provides the clearest illustration yet of what the last two traumatic years within the Labour party have been about. This unexpected left turn in the party’s leadership was, it turns out, not about delivering the party to Hamas, but delivering decent public services and a programme for tackling inequality. In the Times, Libby Purves says the Tory manifesto is right to expect older people to contribute to the care they need: It’s a bold move, and though tweaks and explanations are needed, a necessary one. Those shouting ‘dementia tax’ – often panicking Conservative candidates – are closing their eyes to two things. One is the reality of an ageing population. The other is that the present low, underpaid standard of home care simply will not do… If an old person needs home care – let me speak, I’ll be one sooner than many who read this – then for heaven’s sake let the damn house contribute. For my generation it is a piece of accidental, unearned bunce anyway: we just wanted somewhere to live and had no idea it would become a moneybox. Revelation of the day Ukip will slip out its manifesto on Wednesday but leader Paul Nuttall doesn’t seem that concerned about using it as a springboard to power. Pressed yesterday on how much influence a party polling around 2%, standing in far fewer seats than last time, and with little chance of regaining a toehold in Westminster could wield, Nuttall insisted: It doesn’t really matter how many MPs that you have.

Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) officials rejected \"unrealistic\" estimates made in a 2008 internal report that the plant could be threatened by a tsunami of up to 10.2 metres, Kyodo news agency said. The tsunami that crippled backup power supplies at the plant on the afternoon of 11 March, leading to the meltdown of three reactors, was more than 14 metres high. Evidence that the utility was unprepared for the tsunami, despite previous warnings, came as the firm announced that the manager of the Fukushima plant, Masao Yoshida, was being treated for an unspecified illness and would leave his post on Thursday. The company refused to disclose the nature of Yoshida's illness, but said it was not related to his exposure to radiation during the nine months since the crisis began. \"On doctors' advice, I have no choice but to be hospitalised for treatment,\" Yoshida, 56, reportedly said in a message to staff. \"It breaks my heart to have to bid farewell in this way to all of the people with whom I have worked since the disaster.\" Yoshida, who led the department overseeing the plant's management when the 2008 report was submitted, has been credited with preventing a more serious accident in March. In the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, he approved the continued injection of seawater into one of the damaged reactors, despite being told to abandon the measure by Tepco officials. He was later reprimanded, but won praise from experts who said he had helped cool overheating fuel rods and prevent a worse disaster. Yoshida had not spoken publicly about the accident until earlier this month, when he told reporters that the situation at Fukushima Daiichi had improved considerably and that the reactors would be brought to a safe state, known as cold shutdown, by the end of the year. But he added: \"Several times during the first week of the crisis, I thought I was going to die.\" The accident was triggered when seawater flooded power supply lines, disabling cooling systems and triggering a meltdown in three of Fukushima Daiichi's six reactors. The 40-year-old plant was built on the assumption that the biggest tsunami that could be expected on the Fukushima coast would be 5.7 metres high. Even at that height, the 2008 report said, water levels onsite could exceed 15 metres. Kyodo quoted Tepco sources as saying the plant might have been better prepared for the disaster had it taken the report seriously. Greenpeace, meanwhile, called on Japan not to restart nuclear reactors taken offline for stress tests and maintenance checks until it improves its disaster-response plans. It said simulation maps of potential accidents being used to devise emergency response efforts did not take into account accidents of the severity of the Fukushima disaster. Greenpeace said Japanese government officials had conceded that the Speedi simulations were inadequate, as they are confined to low-level releases of radiation over a six-mile radius. Contamination from the Fukushima accident has spread over a much wider area. The emergency response effort was \"slow, chaotic and insufficient, and it appears that the government has learned nothing from it\", said Junichi Sato, executive director of Greenpeace Japan. \"These maps show that there is a strong risk of reactor restarts being pushed through without a proper, science-based assessment on the real risks being conducted, and without proper precautions being taken to protect the communities around the plants.\" More than 80% of Japan's nuclear reactors will lie idle once Kansai Electric Power suspends operation of a reactor for inspection at a plant in western Japan on Friday. The move will leave all but 10 of the country's 54 reactors out of service. The danger contamination poses to food supplies was underlined this week when officials in Fukushima confirmed that 9kg of a batch of contaminated rice had been sold to consumers this month. The discovery came soon after they banned shipments of another batch of rice containing excessive levels of radioactive caesium. The rice, grown at three farms in the town of Date, contained up to 1,050 becquerels of caesium per kg, compared with the government-set upper limit of 500 becquerels. In response, the government imposed a ban on Tuesday on rice shipments from the area, while local officials said they were trying to trace the consumers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/feb/05/obama-iran-israel-nuclear-military-strike","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-05T23:58:00Z","webTitle":"Obama: US and Israel 'in lockstep' to stop Iran becoming nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/05/obama-iran-israel-nuclear-military-strike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/feb/05/obama-iran-israel-nuclear-military-strike","fields":{"headline":"Obama: US and Israel 'in lockstep' to stop Iran becoming nuclear power","bodyText":"Barack Obama has said that the United States will work in \"lockstep\" with Israel to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power, but he did not believe Israel had decided whether to launch a military strike. The US president's comments appeared to be an attempt to downplay speculation that Israel was preparing to attack Iran following a report last week that the US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, believes an Israeli strike could happen this spring. Obama told NBC television in an interview from the White House on Sunday that Israel is \"rightly\" very concerned about Iran's nuclear program, but said: \"I don't think that Israel has made a decision on what they need to do\". He said that he hopes that the crisis will be resolved diplomatically but reiterated that the US has removed no option from consideration. Asked about a potential attack by Iran on the US mainland, Obama said, \"We don't see any evidence that they have those intentions or capabilities right now.\" Tensions between Israel and Iran have continued to ratchet up in recent days. The Israeli defence minister Ehud Barak claimed on Thursday that there is a \"wide global understanding\" that military action may be needed, while Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called Israel on Friday a \"cancerous tumour that should be cut and will be cut\". Meanwhile, Obama said during the same interview that he deserves re-election, despite the difficulties of the US economy, adding that his administration is creating more than 250,000 jobs a month, the most since 2005, and a reversal from the 750,000 jobs the economy was losing three years ago. The president said US manufacturing still needs a boost: \"We have got to make sure we are pushing American energy, not just oil and gas, but clean energy.\" Obama also said the country needed to return to \"old-fashioned American values,\" so \"everyone gets a fair shake\".

Responding to a Telegraph story on this topic, John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: If this is an attempt by some in the Brexit camp to cow civil society into silence on the EU referendum, it’s bound to fail. The public has heard a lot from industry leaders about how a vote to stay or leave will affect UK businesses - there’s no reason why they shouldn’t be hearing from environmental groups about how it will impact our environment and quality of life. But Leave.EU said environmental charities should not be spending money on pro-EU campaigners. Its spokesman Jack Montgomery said: People will be very disappointed to see environmental charities using their donations to campaign on behalf of Brussels, especially considering the destruction its fisheries policy has wrought on the marine environment and the recent diesel scandal. Sadly, the EU uses a significant portion of the money it takes from us to buy support from these organisations, and the In campaign threatening that it will be taken away after Brexit has them scared. Tristram Hunt, the former shadow education secretary, has said Harold Wilson would be “slightly horrified” by the way Labour is becoming a protest party, rather than a party of government, under Jeremy Corbyn. (See 3.38pm.) Usdaw, the shopworkers’ union, has criticised the government’s latest plan to tone down its proposals to liberalise Sunday trading laws. John Hannett, Usdaw’s general secretary, said: The existing Sunday trading regulations are simple, popular and easily understood by retailers, shopworkers and customers. What the government is now proposing is to take one regulation that covers the whole of England and Wales, turn it into over 300 different regulatory regimes and within each of those there can be zones down to street level. This is the nightmare scenario that will see retailers strangled in red tape as they try to deal with separate Sunday trading rules across the country. This complex scheme is somewhat ironic when the government claims to champion the cutting of red tape for business. The proposal to have tourist zones is drawn so loosely that practically any shop could claim to be included simply because they have customers from outside the borough in which they are located. It could particularly benefit out of town retail parks over town centres. The worries of principled MPs who have deep concerns about the effects of extended Sunday trading have not been addressed. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Sporting Index, a spread betting company, has opened a book on the EU referendum. It expects Remain to get 54% of the vote and Leave 46%. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) could be forced to pay compensation to victims subjected to sex offences at the hands of Libyan soldiers while training in the UK, the Press Association reports. Five Libyans were jailed last year after a court heard they raped and sexually assaulted victims in Cambridgeshire after a collapse of discipline at Bassingbourn Barracks where they were based. Their arrests brought an end to a British government promise to help war-torn Libya by training army cadets in the UK following the 2011 collapse of Muammar Gaddafi’s regime. The incidents prompted the MoD to send 300 soldiers back to their home country prematurely, ending an agreement to put 2,000 soldiers through basic infantry and junior command training in an attempt to help rebuild the troubled nation. The MoD confirmed on Monday that it was considering legal claims from victims. A spokeswoman said: “We can confirm that compensation claims have been received by the department. As the claims are ongoing we are unable to comment further.” A few weeks ago some Conservatives got into a tizzy on the question of how Margaret Thatcher would have voted on the issue of the EU referendum. Today another politician has been intervening from beyond the grave. Friday marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of Harold Wilson, by one measure Labour’s most successful prime minister (he fought five general elections as leader, and won four of them). They were talking about him on the Daily Politics earlier and two Labour MPs, Mary Creagh and Tristram Hunt, were asked what Wilson would have made of the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn. Not much, they both replied. (Admittedly, Creagh and Hunt are both on the right of the party, not the Corbyn wing.) Creagh replied: I think [Wilson] would look at us as a party that is not making the progress that we should be making. And Hunt said: Harold Wilson famously thought that the Labour party was the natural party of government. He did not believe the Labour party was a protest movement protesting outside other party conferences. He thought it should be round the table delivering social justice for the people it came into being to represent. And I think he would be slightly horrified by some of the tendency towards endless protests rather than thinking about how we get into power and do what Labour governments are about, tackling inequality, promoting education, dealing with technology, putting us at the heart of Europe. Hunt was referring to Corbyn’s decision to attend a protest at the Conservative party conference last year. At the end of last week YouGov published figures which it said showed the Remain side making modest progress since the EU referendum campaign formally started two weeks ago. In an analysis for the Times’s Red Box email, Matthew Goodwin, the academic and Ukip specialist, says that a study of all polling since David Cameron’s EU renegotiation concluded two weeks ago suggests that in practice the polls have barely moved. Over the past two weeks, since the renegotiation, no fewer than 11 polls have asked people how they intend to vote at the referendum. Across all of these polls the average support for Remain has been 43 per cent and for Leave 39 per cent, with 18 per cent saying they don’t know how they will vote. So, a tight race. If we compare these averages to those during the first half of February, before the announcement of the renegotiation detail, then Remain has remained static on 43 per cent, Leave has lost one point, and the Undecided have grown by one point. So, if anything, and at a stretch, you could suggest that the renegotiation might have made a few more people slightly more confused about how to vote. But there has certainly not been a bounce for Remain. Here is the BBC audio of the Mervyn King interview on the World at One. Chris Grayling, the leader of the Commons, has accused the British Chambers of Commerce of being “spineless” for its treatment of John Longworth. Grayling, who is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, said he accepted Number 10’s assertion that it did not put pressure on the BCC’s board to remove Longworth after he spoke out publicly in favour of Brexit. The board suspended Longworth because officially the BCC is neutral and Longworth subsequently resigned. Grayling said this was “disgraceful”. I think what’s happened to him has been disgraceful, frankly. The fact that a prominent business figure has stood up and said ‘I believe Britain should leave the EU’ is a view we should be listening to and certainly the way the BCC has approached this in terms of just forcing him out has been wholly unacceptable and in my view has brought that organisation into some degree of disrepute ... I think the question for this is why were the BCC so willing to move to remove someone who had expressed a personal view, a stated personal view. Almost regardless of the debate about where how and when this came from, why was the board of the BCC so spineless that it was not prepared to accept the views of one of its senior people and to give them the freedom that David Cameron has given his ministers. I think it’s just shameful. But David Davis, the Conservative MP and a spokesman for the Grassroots Out campaign (GO), suggested that Longworth was the victim of a Number 10 witch hunt. In a statement announcing that he will use the Freedom of Information Act to try to get details of Number 10’s communications with the BCC about this, he said: The last thing we want to see is a witch-hunt against business leaders brave and astute enough to make the argument that Britain would be better off economically if it regained the power to strike its own trade deals and was freed of the crippling burden of red tape, costing many billions a year, imposed by Brussels. Downing Street has form in this respect. It has already admitted it made a “mistake” in adding the name of General Sir Michael Rose, the former special forces commander, to a letter from former military leaders supporting Britain’s continued membership of the EU. Number 10 has hinted that there was contact between Downing Street and the BCC about Longworth’s speech, but insisted that “no pressure” was applied for his resignation. (See 12.20pm.) Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, has suggested that he could vote to leave the EU. In an interview on the World at One, he claimed he had not yet made up his mind as to how he would vote in the referendum. He appeared to criticise the government and Remain/Leave campaigns for not setting out the arguments properly. He said: I think that you and the BBC have a vitally important role here because the protagonists don’t seem to be capable of setting out carefully and dispassionately the arguments. We need the BBC to explain to everyone the arguments for and the arguments against. There are good arguments for both sides of this debate. Asked to give his own objective analysis, he said he would need a two-hour programme to do that. And, when asked if he had made up his own mind yet, he replied: I’m still waiting to hear the facts and the arguments from I hope the BBC which will enable me to make up my mind. David Cameron has said there is “no prospect” of Britain joining a common European Union asylum system. As the Press Association reports, arriving in Brussels for talks on the migration crisis, Cameron said he supported moves to close the Balkan route used by migrants to travel to northern Europe after arriving in Greece. But he insisted that the UK’s opt-out from the Schengen agreement meant there could be no question of Britain joining any new EU asylum system. We have an absolutely rock-solid opt-out from these things so there is no prospect of Britain joining a common asylum process in Europe. We will have our own asylum approach, our own way of doing things, keeping our borders. It underlines the best of both worlds, the special status that we have. There is more coverage of the summit here, on our live blog. An aide to Labour’s London mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan has resigned after he posted offensive comments on social media and posed with a gun while joking about being a hitman. Shueb Salar, a parliamentary assistant to the former minister, was pictured with a gun and boasting about spending a weekend “shooting stuff with real guns, knives, crossbows and bow and arrows”, according to the Evening Standard. Here’s Denis MacShane, the former Labour Europe minister, on John Longworth’s World at One interview. (See 1.09pm.) At the end of last year, as part of a massive “burying bad news” exercise on the last day the Commons was sitting before the Christmas recess, the government published an independent report from James Ewins into the overseas domestic workers visa. It said the rule saying workers with these visas should be tied to working for a particular employer should be scrapped. Campaigners have also been calling for this, on the grounds that the current rules allow these workers to be exploited. Today, in a written ministerial statement, James Brokenshire, the Home Office minister, has said that ODWs will in future no longer be tied to working for a single particular employer. Here’s an extract. The government’s concern is that if ODWs were able to change employers and significantly prolong their stay, irrespective of whether they have reported this abuse and whether there is evidence that such abuse has taken place, they may be less likely to report abuse. This may perpetuate a revolving door of abuse in which perpetrators remain unidentified and free to bring other domestic workers to the United Kingdom with impunity. The government does, however, acknowledge the case which has been put forward for providing ODWs with an immediate escape route from abuse. On the basis of advice from the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner we have therefore come to the view that there should be two distinct elements to our approach to the employer tie. First, we will provide those admitted as ODWs with the ability to take alternative employment as a domestic worker with a different employer during the six month period for which they are originally admitted. This ability to take alternative employment will not depend on whether or not they have been found to be the victim of abuse. The World at One plays a clip of a BCC member saying Longworth should not have given his personal view on Brexit in his speech. He was there to represent his members, the BCC member said. Longworth says he felt it important to share some of the facts about this with the public. Q: What contact was there between Number 10 and the BCC about your speech? Longworth says he is not aware of any contact between Number 10 and BCC after the day of the conference. It is normal for government departments to make their views known, “often in a very strident way”. Q: Including asking for someone to be sacked? Longworth says he has no knowledge of that. Q; If you had called for Britain to stay in the EU, would you still be in your job? Who knows, asks Longworth. John Longworth, the former British Chambers of Commerce director general, is being interviewed now on the World at One about his resignation. He says he does not regret speaking out. He was trying to inform the debate, he says. He has “lived and breathed” this issue for the last two or three years. Rachel Reeves, the former work and pensions secretary, now a backbencher, gave a wide-ranging speech on the economy that sounded like a pitch to be future shadow chancellor - or chancellor. Three of her big policy ideas were flat pensions tax relief, a move towards universal childcare and more borrowing to invest in infrastructure projects that have a commercial rate of return. But she also had this to say about whether Labour’s current economic policies are credible: I was very pleased at prime minister’s questions last week that Jeremy Corbyn focussed on issues of childcare because those are the things that resonate with people. They are the areas where we need to show we are on the side of ordinary people to contrast us with the Conservatives. More of what Corbyn did last week at PMQs, more focus on bread-and-butter issues, is really important. We’re beginning to move in that direction but there are too many times where, like the Conservative party, we are focusing on some of the internal policy debates. Asked whether she thinks Jeremy Corbyn can win the 2020 election, she said: We’ve got over four years to get this right. I am absolutely certain Labour can win the next election. The way to do that is to take a long hard look at ourselves, understand why we lost the last election and focus relentlessly on holding the government to account and issues that matter to ordinary people. Those are issues like pensions, childcare, having enough money at the end of the month to do things like putting into savings, and to ensure that people have a home of their own or if they are renting having that security that homeowners have. The Tories are making huge mistakes. I believe we can win the next election but it is a huge mountain to climb. Every day not focusing on those key issues is a day wasted. Here are the key points from the Number 10 lobby briefing. Number 10 hinted that there was contact between Downing Street and the British Chambers of Commerce after John Longworth’s pro-Brexit speech on Thursday. The prime minister’s spokeswoman repeatedly refused to deny that Number 10 had been in touch with the organisation. But she insisted that “no pressure” was applied for Longworth’s resignation. Of course Number 10 talks to business organisations regularly. But if you are referring to Mr Longworth’s decision to step down, that is entirely a matter for the BCC. We should be absolutely clear that no pressure was applied by Number 10 ... This is a decision for Mr Longworth and the BCC. The president of the BCC has set out very clearly the reason behind that decision. Asked if Number 10 initiated the talks, or if Longworth’s name came up, the spokeswoman said she would not get into “a blow-by-blow [account] of those conversations”. She also declined to say how she defined “pressure”, saying the reporter who asked the question was “missing the point”. Downing Street rejected Longworth’s claim (see 10.37am) that the government has been scaremongering about Brexit. The spokeswoman said David Cameron had made it clear that he wanted the government to set out the facts, so that people could listen to the arguments about EU membership. The spokeswoman said that reports that the Turkish government had taken over an opposition newspaper were “extremely concerning”. Explaining the government’s position on this, she said: We do think that freedom of expression must be fully respected [in Turkey] and we continue to urge the Turks to work towards the full protection of fundamental rights. But she played down suggestions that Cameron would raise the issue at today’s EU/Turkey summit. The spokeswoman insisted that the plan to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point had the “full support” of the French government, playing down suggestions that the resignation of EDF’s finance director could lead to the French energy company pulling out of the project. The spokeswoman would not confirm or deny a report saying Cameron has decided that he won’t take part in the BBC’s planned EU referendum Question Time event if the programme also features a pro-Brexit Tory. There has been speculation that Michael Gove could be the other main guest. In the Sunday Times yesterday Tim Shipman said that Cameron would not take part in such a programme, and that Number 10 had concerns about another EU referendum debate being planned by the BBC in front of a 12,500-strong audience at Wembley arena. Shipman wrote: It is understood there is “serious concern” in Downing Street about the format of the debate. No 10 officials have also said Cameron will not take part in an earlier showdown in front of a BBC1 Question Time audience if he has to compete with a fellow Tory. “We’re not doing blue on blue,” one said. The spokeswoman said that Downing Street still wanted to see detailed proposals from the BBC and that no decisions had yet been taken as to what debates Cameron might participate in. I’m just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. The prime minister’s spokeswoman is not denying that there was contact between Downing Street and the British Chambers of Commerce after John Longworth’s Brexit speech on Thursday. But the spokeswoman insisted that No 10 had not pressurised for him to be sacked. I’ll post a full summary shortly. And John Longworth has been speaking to Sky News. I’m off to the lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. Boris Johnson has told LBC he is “very sad” that John Longworth has been pushed out of his job. He said: I think it is very sad that somebody like John Longworth who’s given a lot of time, a lot of thought to the needs of British business and industry should be basically pushed out for saying what he thinks. He thinks that the risks of staying in Europe with a disastrous single currency, with the migration problems that they’ve got, are far higher than the risks of getting out and doing our own trade deals, getting back control of our borders and getting back, by the way about £15bn, or £10bn that we send every year to Brussels and never see again. So I think he’s totally right and I very much hope now he’ll be joining this movement. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. As for the rest of the papers, here is the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must-reads, and here is the ConservativeHome round-up of today’s politics stories. And here are five articles I found particularly interesting. Boris Johnson in his Daily Telegraph column says the status quo is not on the ballot paper in the EU referendum, because plans to intensify Eurozone cooperation will affect Britain. Now EU chiefs are struggling to remedy the defects in that project, and they have produced a report explaining what they want to do. It is called the “Five Presidents’ Report”, and it came out last year and got rather buried in the aftermath of the general election. History teaches us that we would be mad to ignore this text. The five presidents in question are those of the European Commission, the Council, the European Parliament, the European Central Bank and a body called the “European Stability Mechanism”. They want to prop up the euro by creating an all-out economic government of Europe. They want a euro-area treasury, with further pooling of tax and budgetary policy. They want to harmonise insolvency law, company law, property rights, social security systems – and there is no way the UK can be unaffected by this process. As the Five Presidents put it: “Much can be already achieved through a deepening of the Single Market, which is important for all 28 EU member states.” So even though Britain is out of the euro, there is nothing we can do to stop our friends from using “single market” legislation to push forward centralising measures that will help prop up the euro (or so they imagine), by aligning EU economic, social and fiscal policies. Insofar as the recent “UK Agreement” has any force, it expressly allows these measures to be pursued, and agrees the UK will not attempt to exercise a veto. In other words we will find ourselves dragged along willy-nilly, in spite of all protestations to the contrary. Michael Savage in the Times (paywall) says the government could be forced to compromise over its plans to liberalise Sunday trading laws. The government may be forced to amend its plans to relax Sunday trading rules after Tory MPs threatened to vote down the measure. Ministers, some of their aides and dozens of backbenchers are ready to block the plans unless they are altered before a Commons vote this week, according to the MP leading the rebellion. George Osborne faces the prospect of a Commons defeat only a week before his budget. Last night there were reports that ministers are considering moderating the measures. One attempt to liberalise Sunday trading rules has already been dropped after Conservative opposition. No 10 is also keen to delay any plans that risk distracting from its efforts to keep Britain in the EU. Christopher Hope in the Telegraph says one compromise being backed by the communities minister Brandon Lewis would involve shops would be able to open for longer on Sundays in areas designated as important for tourism, rather than all outlets in a council area. Brandon Lewis, the Local Government minister, said, under the compromise deal, councils would be able to “draw a red line” around town centres and high streets “so that they had the liberalisation, but not the out of town shops”. Ministers are hoping that the last minute change will win support of Tory MPs because it could lead to a boost in trade on high streets, which have been in decline for some years. Trevor Kavanagh in the Sun says that Boris Johnson’s performance on the Andrew Marr Show yesterday “may have damaged both Brexit and his dream of becoming our next prime minister.” He also says he expects at least one cabinet minister to resign over the EU referendum. It is hard to see how either man [Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith] — or any Eurosceptic minister — can remain bound by Cabinet ties while battling for a cause they have supported all their political lives. I can reveal that around the kitchen table some are already wondering if they can fight the most important battle of their lives with their hands tied. As Project Fear’s propaganda war gets dirtier and more personal, expect at least one Cabinet resignation in the weeks to come. Ben Riley-Smith in the Telegraph says Labour is considering a plan to allow voters or members decide who the party nominates for an honour. The most radical proposal being considered in the review is for Labour to effectively boycott the honours system by refusing to put forward any names. However a series of other changes are also being looked at to meet Mr Corbyn’s desire to democratise the way choices are made and broaden the range of those recognised. One option would see voters given the chance to nominate who should get honours, with the most popular being put forward by the party. A second idea would be for Labour members to nominate candidates and the party’s ruling body then make decisions rather than the leader himself. John Longworth, the former BCC director general, has told the Daily Telegraph that the government is being “highly irresponsible” spreading “hyperbole” about what would happen if Britain left the EU. He said: It is highly irresponsible of the government of the country to be peddling hyperbole. It is all right for the campaign groups to do it because they are promoting a particular position. But the government has to be responsible. And the fact of the matter is that there is a chance that the country will vote to leave. If the government keeps peddling the line that it will be a disaster if we leave - which it actually won’t be - they are going to put the country in a position where it will be damaged if we do. Longworth declined to comment on suggestions that Number 10 put pressure on him to resign. Rachel Reeves, the former shadow work and pensions secretary, has been delivering a speech on the economy to the Social Market Foundation thinktank. In an article for the Times’s Red Box political email, she says George Osborne should change his budget surplus rule to make it easier for the government to invest in infrastructure. Capital spending which generates a return should be exempt from the rule, she says. All this is evidence that Mr Osborne’s short-sighted refusal to change his borrowing rules is further damaging our already fragile economy. Instead of using his budget next week as the latest in a series of job applications to become the next Tory leader, the chancellor should radically alter his borrowing rules, which are far too crude. The rules should be changed so that investment in infrastructure which brings positive returns to the taxpayer – either directly or in the form of higher tax receipts – is separated from day-to-day spending on welfare and public sector salaries. The two spending areas are different, and should be treated so. With the cost of borrowing at rock bottom, there will never be a better time to improve our infrastructure through sensible investment. The chancellor should overhaul his fiscal rules to support investment in infrastructure and capitalise on those low borrowing rates. This is from the BBC’s Kamal Ahmed. James Ramsbotham, chief executive of the North East Chamber of Commerce, told the Today programme this morning that it was obvious that John Longworth would have to resign as director general of the British Chambers of Commerce as soon as he gave his speech last week backing Brexit. Ramsbotham said: From the moment John was giving his speech it was very, very clear to everyone involved in Chambers of Commerce across the country that this would be the outcome. It was “very important” that the BCC represent “the complete gamut of our membership, not our personal views”, Ramsbotham said. Officially the BCC has decided to remain neutral, but a recent survey found that 60% of its members were in favour of staying in the EU, and 30% in favour of leaving. Ramsbotham said that in the north east 63% of members wanted to stay in the EU, and 29% favoured Brexit. He also said he was “not aware” of any political pressure for Longworth to lose his post as a result of his speech. The Ukip MEP Roger Helmer says the fact that the British Chamber of Commerce is now saying it was not nobbled by Number 10 shows just how effectively it has been nobbled by Number 10. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, claims on Twitter that John Longworth has been treated “appallingly”. But the Daily Mail’s John Stevens points out that Farage himself hasn’t got a very good record when it comes to tolerating dissent. Stevens was referring to the fact that the Ukip MEP Suzanne Evans has now been sacked twice within two weeks from Ukip posts for not supporting Farage. Last week David Cameron criticised Brexit campaigners for promoting “David Icke-style” conspiracy theories. If he thought that was going to stop his opponents making allegations about Number 10 using underhand tactics to try to promote the case for Britain staying in the EU, he will be disappointed. Today a row has erupted involving what is either the biggest conspiracy theory, or biggest conspiracy, depending on who you believe, to hit the headlines since the EU referendum campaign formally started. It involves John Longworth, the director general of the British Chamber of Commerce, who used a speech last week to say that he was personally opposed to Britain staying in the EU, even though the BCC as a whole had decided to remain neutral. He was initially suspended from his post by the BCC’s board and then he decided to resign. Brexit campaigners are claiming that Number 10 was somehow involved. The Daily Mail has splashed on the story. The evidence to justify its headline comes from a quote from “a friend of Longworth’s” in the story. A friend of Mr Longworth said: ‘John feels he has done everything by the book and is dismayed at what has happened. No 10 has had a hand in this, putting pressure on the BCC board to silence him.’ As the Guardian’s story on this reveals, Longworth himself has refused to comment publicly on this suggestion. Longworth told the Guardian by text message on Sunday night that he is planning to expand upon his views in the run up to the referendum in June. However, he pointedly did not respond to questions asking whether either he or the BCC had been put under pressure by Downing Street or members of the Remain campaign to either suspend him or remove him from office. But the BCC itself has issued a lengthy statement insisting that there was no outside influence involved in what happened. Here’s an excerpt. No politician or interest group had any influence on the BCC Board decision to suspend Mr Longworth. His subsequent resignation was agreed mutually between Mr Longworth and the BCC Board, and there were no external factors involved. The only views taken into account were those of the BCC Board and the BCC’s owners, the UK accredited Chamber Network. And this morning Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, told Sky News that Brexit campaigners had fallen for “bizarre conspiracy theories” about Longworth’s departure. This is what he said when asked if he could give an assurance that Number 10, and its officials, had nothing to do with Longworth’s resignation. I can give you that absolute assurance, because the board of the British Chambers of Commerce have made it very clear that this was their decision, and there was no external pressure from anybody else. People who want to leave Europe are seeing conspiracy theories everywhere now because they don’t want to answer the basic questions, which is if you leave Europe, where are you going? What are the new arrangements for trade? What is going to happen to the jobs that depend on Europe? They have to start answering these questions instead of coming up with rather bizarre conspiracy theories that here the British Chambers of Commerce have flatly denied. I will be covering more on this story as it develops. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Rachel Reeves, the former shadow work and pensions secretary, gives a speech to the Social Market Foundation. 11am: Number 10 lobby briefing. 11.15am: David Cameron arrives at the EU/Turkey summit in Brussels. Here is our preview story. 3.45pm: Priti Patel, the employment minister, gives evidence to the Commons work and pensions committee on universal credit. As usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter. If you think there are any voices that I’m leaving out, particularly political figures or organisations giving alternative views of the stories I’m covering, do please flag them up below the line (include “Andrew” in the post). I can’t promise to include everything, but I do try to be open to as wide a range of perspectives as possible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/17/lakedistrict-nuclearpower-west-cumbria-managing-nuclear-waste-safely-partnership","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-17T13:00:00Z","webTitle":"Full report published on Cumbria nuclear waste burial and local involvement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/17/lakedistrict-nuclearpower-west-cumbria-managing-nuclear-waste-safely-partnership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/17/lakedistrict-nuclearpower-west-cumbria-managing-nuclear-waste-safely-partnership","fields":{"headline":"Full report published on Cumbria nuclear waste burial and local involvement","bodyText":"The complicated and contentious issue of burying nuclear waste in Cumbria is heading for a milestone on 11 October when the three local councils which have expressed an interest meet to debate further involvement. A useful waymarker has now been published in full, based on the views of some 2,300 people and organisations whose submissions, while often very different and sometimes in direct conflict, have led to changes and hesitations, albeit not altering the general approach of cautiously making headway. The document was summarised on 19 July and you can read a precis of that here. The full report has now gone up online and that is available here. It is the work of the West Cumbria Managing Radioactive Waste Safely Partnership which is made up of the councils - Cumbria county and Allerdale and Copeland districts – and other groups including the National Farmers Union, the Lake District national park authority and representatives of all the parish councils potentially involved. Not surprisingly for someone whose colleagues have spent three years on the review, the chair of the partnership Coun Elaine Woodburn, Labour leader of Copeland since 2003, asks people to spend time reading and thinking about the full report. Events are also likely to move at a pace appropriate to a project which has a timeline so lengthy that all manner of unexpected developments could have an effect; the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority which is overseeing research into the pros and cons of burial, spoke last year of high level waste and spent fuels being buried 1000 metres deep from 2075 and spent fuel from as yet unbuilt nuclear reactors from 2130. The dates have crept nearer, however, with the possibility of intermediate level waste going underground in metal containers in 2040 and, last month, a suggestion in leaked correspondence that the current government would like to press on faster than its Labour predecessor, which first raised the proposal, and see if intermediate disposal could start in 2029. The West Cumbria partnership report covers seven main themes and finds common ground between participants on the over-riding importance of more detailed geological research, the right of councils to withdraw right up to the point where work would start and a substantial package of community benefits if burial goes ahead. In simple terms, the long-standing debate in the area over balancing the risks of nuclear power with its economic benefits continues over this latest issue. More than a third of employed people in Copeland and ten percent of those in Allerdale work at Sellafield nuclear power complex. There is a mass of opinion and information already online, including an Ipsos Mori poll in May which found 53 percent of local people in favour of continuing geological research and 33 percent against, and the website of Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment. The new report has few surprises for those already involved but is handy and accessible as a guide to the issue and how things stand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2014/aug/24/-sp-walking-england-new-coast-path-noth-east","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-24T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Walking England’s new coast path: sea and skylarks in the north-east","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/aug/24/-sp-walking-england-new-coast-path-noth-east","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2014/aug/24/-sp-walking-england-new-coast-path-noth-east","fields":{"headline":"Walking England’s new coast path: sea and skylarks in the north-east","bodyText":"Which do you like best: skylarks or racing pigeons? Coal-stained “black beaches” or white sandy ones? Kebabs or haute cuisine? On the new coast path between Hartlepool, County Durham, and Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, the great thing is that you don’t have to choose. The route, which starts in North Gare beach by the mouth of the Tees and ends 34 miles to the north on the other side of the Wear, is either the ultimate in post-industrial flaneuring, or psycho-geographical “edgelanding” (exploring the boundaries where urban meets rural) – in other words going for a walk in the kind of landscape many of us grew up in. “Eventually, this path will be part of a 4,500km [2,796 miles] England Coast Path,” said Andrew Best of Natural England, joining me and a friend for the walk. “We chose this area for the first stretch because the local authorities were really up for it – and it’s fascinating but under-explored.” We set off on a glorious day from a car park at North Gare. Before facing north to follow the new ECP signs along the coast, we looked back towards EDF’s two nuclear power stations, the Seal Sands oil terminal and a landfill site. There’s still plenty of working industry in the north-east, but when we turned around we were looking over recovering grasslands, with redshanks, blackcaps and butterflies flickering all about. Every few metres a skylark ascended, emitting its busy call. The walk into Hartlepool was flat and easy. Seaton Carew looked like a seaside town stuck somewhere between a quaint past and a future with potential. A new promenade was busy with pram-pushers, mobility scooters and dog-walkers. Everyone smiled and said hello. An old deco-style lido was crying out for a posh cafe and a spot of gentrification. At Hartlepool railway station we stopped for refreshment at the Rat Race, a lovely micro pub serving real ales (“924 beers since November 2009”), Belgian beers, and posh crisps. Skirting the pleasant harbour – and some less pleasant strip malls and dual carriageways – we came to a suburb called Headland, which lives up to its name geographically, and is the site of a statue commemorating much-loved sexist, beer-swilling comic-strip layabout Andy Capp. Beside him stands Saint Andrew’s church, converted into the beautiful Mary Rowntree restaurant in 2012, and serving thinly battered fish and thrice-fried chips, with fine wines and even finer mushy peas. After Headland we were on Durham’s Heritage Coast, established in the late 1990s after the closure of the collieries to beautify the area and protect the magnesian limestone cliffs, unique to the region. The official path currently meanders through development land so we opted to walk via North Sands beach – easy enough at low tide – and enjoy a plodge (paddle) on the way. Wood-framed Steetley Pier sticks far out, a remnant of the magnesite industry that is now used by fishermen brave enough to clamber up its rotting legs. A little farther along was a fenced-in nesting area for little terns, a rare breed on these shores. Just beneath it a ringed plover was scouring a stream for food. The next day took us past a string of former colliery towns, including Blackhall, Horden and Easington – the last pit to be closed hereabouts, and the setting for the film Billy Elliot. As the son of a miner, I lament the passing of the work and the communities it gave rise to, but it has to be said that the landscape now is glorious. Where once stood pit-heads, scars of wasteland and mountains of slack, meadows are enlivened by orchids, and poppies bob at the edges of fields of rapeseed and wheat. Some of the beaches are still stained coal-black. For years, tons of waste was simply tipped over the cliffs and allowed to wash out to sea – or not. By Easington it had begun to drizzle. In a public garden a pithead wheel had been laid flat, part of a memorial to miners both living and those “taken from the darkness of their toil”, between 1899 and 1993. We looked in vain for a coffee shop, before continuing in the rain to Seaham, our first proper town since Hartlepool. Here there was coffee, curry, a grand B&amp;B – and the stunning steel sculpture of a first world war soldier by local artist Ray Lonsdale. We were back with the skylarks for the final furlongs, tramping through coastal heathland atop high cliffs of soft sandstone. I had to dip my head to avoid a team of manic racing pigeons, far too energetic to be feral urbanites. Our calves got a workout on the frequent, steep-sided denes – glacial valleys once riven by glaciers, most now filled with ancient ash trees. And so to Sunderland, through repurposed factories, warehouses and estates of tower blocks and redbrick terraces. We were sleeping in the suburb of Seaburn, a couple of miles north, but crossing the majestic Wearmouth Bridge felt like the arrival. Compton Mackenzie, the Hartlepool-born author, once said: “Never stand when you can sit. Never sit when you can lie. Never walk when you can ride.” That thought, probably once shared by rich and poor alike, belongs to an era when Durham folk trudged to work, slogged their guts out, and trudged home – mostly in the dark. Their landscape has been reborn, and reclaimed, for the rest of us. Walkers of England, unite! You have nothing to lose but your weight. England Coast Path: a work in progress When Wales got its 870-mile coast path in May 2012, there was all manner of fanfare and media attention. It’s little wonder that England has decided to get one, too. Three years in the planning, the England Coast Path (ECP) will stretch for 2,796 miles when completed. “We’re building it to National Trail standards, which is why the ECP signs have an acorn on them,” says Andrew Best of Natural England. “That means walkers will have full rights of way and it will be future-proofed. When the coast recedes – as it does very fast on parts of the east coast – the path will move inward with it.” As well as the new north-east section, there’s a new 22-mile path on the Cumbrian coast between Allonby and Whitehaven. A short section also opened in Dorset for the 2012 Olympics sailing events on part of the established South West Coast Path. The next new ECP sections to open will be in Kent, Norfolk and Somerset. Best is part of the team that oversees the north-east corner, from the Scottish border to the Humber Bridge. “We’ll hopefully get as far south as Hull for its Capital of Culture year [2017] and the rest by 2020.” Pressed on the ECP completion date, he’s cautious. “It depends on government funding. We’ll see after the next election.” • nationaltrail.co.uk/england-coast-path Getting there and around Northern Rail (northernrail.org) and First Trans Pennine Express (tpexpress.co.uk) link the region to Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool.

They still use their conference to hammer out policy. Unlike the other two conferences, debates still take up the majority of the timetable. Only at Lib Dem conference is the language of motions, amendments, rulings from the chair, references back and summings-up still an integral part of proceedings. All of this may seem quaint, but healthy political parties ought to be democracies which debate their causes, not promotional machines for the leadership. The Glasgow conference will certainly put some of this high-minded tradition to the test. Nick Clegg's leadership may not be under direct challenge – though the issue cannot be laughed off when his standing with the voters is so low. But Mr Clegg has to take his party seriously this week nevertheless. On at least four substantive issues – tax and the economy, tuition fees, Trident and nuclear power – this week's conference faces decisions which will help to define the party in 2015 . Meanwhile the choice of emergency motions, especially concerning the David Miranda arrest, are a litmus test of the modern party's civil liberties credentials. Mr Clegg has decided to reply to the economic debate on Monday. He has taken this high-profile step because he is anxious that his party claims some political credit for the early signs of an economic recovery. But he must also therefore decide whether to stand out against amendments which draw a sharper dividing line between the Lib Dems and the Conservatives within the coalition than has previously been done. These amendments from social liberals call for rebalancing the economy, a focus on the most economically vulnerable, a boost for council house building and, after 2015, for fairer taxes on wealth and land. This is hardly Bolshevism. It would be extraordinary, not least in the light of Vince Cable's call for a boost to the minimum wage in the Guardian, if Mr Clegg did not accept them. The party leadership should take a similarly relaxed view of the debate on tuition fees, where they face an amendment calling for a review in the next parliament of the current system of higher education finance. But the conference should back the intelligent and progressive policy put forward in this year's Lib Dem review of Trident, under which the UK would reduce the number of submarines as part of a multilateral approach to nuclear disarmament. In the most anguished debate of the week, however, the Lib Dems should be wary of abandoning their signature anti-nuclear power stance, a key issue for many of the party's depleted but committed core voters. Liberal Democrat pride at proving themselves as a party of government inevitably jostles with anxiety about some of the compromises made, and the electoral damage sustained. The voters' verdict in 2015 may be brutal. One way of preventing that is to revive the party's reputation for standing up for civil liberties against the over-mighty state. The Lib Dems have a hugely important opportunity to burnish that reputation this week. The Guardian's revelations about NSA and GCHQ internet data mining raise immense privacy and trust issues which must be properly debated not brushed indiscriminately under the carpet in the name of security. The main parties, as distinct from the Greens, who highlighted the issue on Friday, have not yet taken up their responsibility to do this.

Nobody likes their decisions to be challenged but, as the new master of the rolls, Lord Dyson, recently said: \"there is no principle more basic to our system of law than the maintenance of rule of law itself and the constitutional protection afforded by judicial review.\" Dyson is right. The best indicator as to whether a country has the rule of law is this: Can the ordinary person challenge a decision by a public official (police, minister, planning authority and so on) with a reasonable chance of redress if the decision is unlawful? In countries under the rule of law, courts or other tribunals are hospitable to such challenges and hear them openly and fairly. Countries without the rule of law stack the odds in favour of governmental decisions which are difficult or impossible genuinely to question. One of the beacons of Britain's modern democracy is its advanced system of judicial review of administration. It is hard to believe now that even in the 1960s, our courts were just about as executive-minded as judges in some non-democratic states, refusing to rock the boat of public policy. If parliament conferred discretionary power on an official in wide terms (such as \"to act as he sees fit\", or \"in the public interest\"), then the courts would interpret such a power as the grant of an infinite authority, with which they could not properly interfere. Back then, in the aftermath of two world wars, it is true that there was little opportunity to hold officials accountable for their actions on the part of consumers, customers, constituents or clients. Even the architects of the welfare state from the 1940s were reluctant to give people the right to judicial review of decisions taken in the new health service, or in the area of welfare and social security. Parliament and the courts endorsed this zone of immunity around those in positions of power. Spurred on by visionary judges such as Lord Atkin, who said that \"the law should speak the same language in war as in peace\", the national habit of deference changed and judicial review, among other avenues of accountability, political and legal, began to be shaped. By the 1980s our law required all decision-makers, \"be he ever so high\", to make decisions that were within the letter as well as purpose of the law, taken after a genuinely fair hearing, and with a result that was not arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable. Justice finally trumped convenience and a view that our public officials, however admirable, inevitably act lawfully. As a result, challenges to decisions at all levels naturally increased, pursued not only by immigrants or trouble-makers, but by ordinary street traders unfairly refused licences to trade, policemen summarily dismissed, students unreasonably refused grants, householders unlawfully refused planning permission, or farmers whose grants were wrongly denied. In addition there were the high profile cases, such as the legally incorrect decision to withdraw a rail franchise or to sanction a nuclear power programme without sufficient consultation. It is important to note that judicial review does not involve a challenge to the merits of a decision. It is fundamental that judicial review is not the same as an appeal. The judge may not take the decision as if he or she were retaking the decision of the primary decision-maker. Judicial review involves a decision only as to whether the decision was taken outside of the law. That is why it is often said that judicial review is a constitutional right – the right of everyone to prevent an unlawful decision from taking effect. Nor is there a free-for-all. As opposed to the procedures in most other countries, we have instituted a tightly controlled, quick and relatively cheap procedure called the application for judicial review, under which a challenge to a decision must be made \"promptly\", together with a careful filtering process, whereby permission must first be granted to apply for review on the ground of a realistically arguable case. As a result, only 174 of the 11,200 applications brought in 2011 made it to the substantial review stage. We ought always strive to streamline our judicial system. However, our right of access to justice should not be lightly interfered with. Judicial review as developed by the British courts, in dialogue with our parliament, is seen the world over as one of our greatest legal contributions of recent years. In South Africa, after the fall of apartheid, their new constitution adopted precisely the British tenets of what they called \"just administrative action\" namely, the right to official decisions that are lawful, reasonable and fair. Many other countries, especially in the Commonwealth, have emulated that model. Any minister who seeks to diminish the opportunity to challenge his decisions and those of his colleagues and other officials in our courts will be reversing fifty years of one of the United Kingdom's most significant legal developments. He will also be threatening a fundamental constitutional principle under which no-one should be unduly protected from the reach of the law.

In the case of the reactor design chosen for Hinkley C, the French-designed European Pressurised Reactor (EPR), there is not yet a finished power plant to judge by. The two plants closest to completion, in Finland and France, have been plagued by astonishing cost overruns and construction delays, along with a litany of complaints over design flaws, poor quality control, and construction lapses. When construction on Finland’s Olkiluoto 3 began in 2005, French nuclear company Areva had promised to be finished by summer 2009 – a record time for a prototype nuclear reactor. Rare is the nuclear commission that doesn’t fall at least somewhat behind schedule, but fundamental problems with poorly trained subcontractors pouring substandard concrete for essential structures and improperly welded reactor containment suggested systemic problems with the quality standards and much-invoked \"safety culture\" at Areva. The EPR’s automatic control system and safety system, by Siemens, also proved insufficiently robust. In 2009, nuclear safety regulators in Britain, Finland, and France jointly released a report judging the safety system to be insufficiently independent from the automatic control system, sending Areva back to the drawing board. This means that the EPR design selected for Hinkley C is not actually a finished product – one key component remains in development. It is also troubling to consider that the conventional nuclear risk assessment carried out for Hinkley C is generally understood to be structurally limited when it comes to \"beyond design-based\" factors, ie the cascading series of problems that characterise failures of highly integrated complex systems in nuclear plants as seen in all the major accidents at Three-Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima. Originally commissioned at €3bn, the cost of the Olkiluoto 3 in Finland has ballooned to an estimated €8.5bn. Amid the finger-pointing between Areva and Finnish electricity provider Teollisuuden Voima Oy (TVO), with each suing the other for losses as a result of the delays and other problems (€2.7 and €1.8bn, respectively), Areva has apparently not submitted a revised schedule and did not renew contracts for 50 work foremen at the site in February, when work all but stopped for most of the month. With all the mounting setbacks, no one involved in the project dares to predict when the plant will actually come online, but Finnish media sources estimate its completion date will have slipped from 2009 to 2018, or perhaps even as late as 2020. Areva dismisses these hitches as a \"Finnish problem\" stemming from the travails of a difficult client, so it is fair to look at the only other European-based EPR project, in Flamanville in northern France. France is perhaps one of the most pro-nuclear places in the world to build a reactor, with about 75% of the country's electricity already generated from the atom. But Flamanville is also years behind schedule and far over budget. Work started in 2007, yet similar problems with questionable quality control and design issues have dragged the completion date into 2016 (this for a project originally intended to last 4.5 years). The final bill for Flamanville is estimated to reach €8.5bn – exactly the same as the upwardly revised cost of Olkiluoto. Against this desultory backdrop, it is instructive to note that in policy circles, EPR also stands for Extended Producer Responsibility, the concept that the manufacturer of a smartphone, for example, should be responsible for recycling the handset when discarded. This policy, which is law in the EU and in Japan, not only limits environmental fallout but creates efficiencies as firms design products to be easier and safer to recycle. By contrast, the nuclear sector seems to represent the opposite pole of the continuum, with little or no \"extended responsibility\" to be found. Politicians and utilities rarely take proper responsibility for mishaps during construction and operation, nor for radiation leaks, nor the decommissioning of irradiated components at \"end of life\", nor for the nuclear waste that accumulates. With the UK ready to embark on new EPR reactors – should the EU even approve the deal struck between EDF and the government – developments at Olkiluoto and Flamanville will continue to cast a long shadow over Hinkley C. • Peter Wynn Kirby is a nuclear and environmental specialist at the University of Oxford."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/jan/21/row-renewables-energy-targets-eu-greenhouse-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-21T18:46:20Z","webTitle":"Row over renewable energy holds up EU greenhouse gas emissions deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/21/row-renewables-energy-targets-eu-greenhouse-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jan/21/row-renewables-energy-targets-eu-greenhouse-gas","fields":{"headline":"Row over renewable energy holds up EU greenhouse gas emissions deal","bodyText":"Negotiations over landmark targets for greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are continuing , just hours before their planned publication on Wednesday. At stake is whether the EU opts for a 35% or 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, and whether the block sets a firm target for renewable energy generation. The UK government is strongly opposed to a target for renewable energy generation, and its opposition has led to the impasse. The European commission president, José Manuel Barroso, is now poised to intervene in the row, potentially ditching plans for a renewable energy target in order to seal a deal on emissions. The proposal for a 2030 target of a 40% cut in emissions has been in the works for two years and several studies have shown that the EU could meet the target without economic difficulty. At least five commissioners are still arguing in favour of an emissions cut of only 35%. But as the biggest economies within the EU – including Germany, France and the UK – are all agreed that the 40% target should be accepted, the likelihood is that it will go ahead. The bloc is already on track to exceed its current target of cutting emissions by 20% on 1990 levels by 2020, and will have probably reduced emissions to 25% by then. The main row is now over the renewables element of the package, supported by larger member states including Germany, France and Italy, but which Barroso is considering watering down or dropping to broker a compromise. Governments around the world have committed to publish pledges within the next year on their greenhouse gas emissions cuts beyond 2020, when current commitments expire, in preparation for a global conference on climate change in Paris in 2015. At the Paris meeting, governments are expected to forge a fresh global agreement on climate change, binding both developed and developing countries to cut emissions in order to avoid dangerous levels of global warming. The commission proposals have reached stalemate at this late stage in part because of the UK's insistence that there should be no renewable energy target for 2030. The current EU targets include a goal of producing a fifth of energy from renewable sources by 2020, an aim that is credited with assisting the substantial growth in clean energy across the bloc. Many countries want a similar – but more stringent – goal to be included in the 2030 climate and energy package. Ed Davey, the UK's Liberal Democrat energy and climate change secretary, has claimed that his opposition to a 2030 renewables goal was \"getting traction\" among other member states, although he could only name Spain. The Spanish government did not reply to a request for comment. The countries signing the letter in favour of a renewable energy target included Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Portugal as well as Germany, France and Italy. The Lib Dems have previously strongly supported a renewable energy target, and their current stance has been criticised by green campaigners. The UK government's opposition to a renewables target, is understood to be the result of a compromise within the governing coalition over climate policy. It is understood that the Treasury wants to be able to include nuclear power and fears that a renewable energy target would mean less investment in its favoured alternative, shale gas. Green MEPs and environmental campaigners are arguing in favour of a much stronger target on greenhouse gas emissions, as well as a strong renewable energy goal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/jan/22/eon-close-power-stations-blackout","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-22T22:13:44Z","webTitle":"E.ON runs down power stations despite blackout warning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/22/eon-close-power-stations-blackout","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/22/eon-close-power-stations-blackout","fields":{"headline":"E.ON runs down power stations despite blackout warning","bodyText":"E.ON is to shut one gas-fired power station and expects to reduce output at three others despite continued warnings from the National Grid and others that Britain faces a capacity crunch and potential blackouts. The German-owned gas and electricity provider said it planned to end power supplies from Stoke-on-Trent in the Midlands and scale back operations at Castleford, Sandbach and Thornhill in the north of the country. E.ON recently closed the Kingsnorth coal-burning power station in Kent while another big six supplier, RWE, has closed Tilbury on the Thames. The huge Eggborough facility in North Yorkshire, owned by private equity firms, is also under threat of closure while Centrica, the owner of British Gas, and SSE have mothballed gas-fired stations. Power companies argue that while coal-fired stations are being hit by tougher pollution regulations emanating from Europe, the economics of gas ones are also being hit by a combination of factors including relatively high wholesale gas prices when compared with cheap coal supplies exported from the US – where it has become surplus to requirements thanks to the country's shale gas boom. \"Over the last five years, E.ON has invested £6bn in the UK's infrastructure, but there is no doubt that the operational environment remains very challenging, particularly for CCGT (combined cycle gas turbine) power stations, which in many areas are continuing to fight for survival in the current market, providing increasing uncertainty around future generating capacity planning,\" said Richard Pennells, a director at E.ON UK. E.ON, like German-owned RWE, is also suffering from wider financial problems in its domestic market, which led to a prediction in November that it could be forced to close more than 11,000 megawatts of capacity around Europe. The decision by the Berlin government to run down its country's nuclear power stations after Japan's Fukushima disaster has cost German utilities billions in writedowns. The Stoke plant produces only 56 MW, but its closure and the moves at the three other plants will still shake a government that has been told by energy regulator Ofgem that power companies may have to be paid to keep old power stations on standby to meet power shortages that some have claimed could hit at any time. But E.ON said the four power stations that are affected by its plans are all around 10 years old, are not built to be easily switched on and off, and are in need of potentially costly maintenance or refits to keep them running in the longer term. \"You don't buy new tyres for an old car,\" said one E.ON source, who added that it was important to take commercial decisions for the sake of the group and the customer who could end up paying. The risk of blackouts – including ones this winter – has been at its highest level for almost a decade, the Grid warned two months ago. Ofgem has also said that with old and polluting power stations closing, the spare generating capacity on the power system was likely to fall to 4% in 2015/16. The now dismantled state-owned Central Electricity Generating Board at one time used to argue that a minimum capacity to cope with peak demand should not be less than 25%. The gas and coal power station shutdowns in Britain come just as many old nuclear plants go offline as they end their natural life. New wind farms have not been built as fast as expected either. • This article was amended on 23 January 2014 to remove a reference to E.ON in the photo caption."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2014/nov/12/hamburg-global-reverse-privatisation-city-services","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-12T09:25:29Z","webTitle":"Hamburg at forefront of global drive to reverse privatisation of city services","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/12/hamburg-global-reverse-privatisation-city-services","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2014/nov/12/hamburg-global-reverse-privatisation-city-services","fields":{"headline":"Hamburg at forefront of global drive to reverse privatisation of city services","bodyText":"In December 2009, a dozen people scrambled up the trees in a small neighbourhood park in Hamburg, Germany’s northern port city. Determined to block the construction of a new 12km energy pipeline, which they said threatened three parks and hundreds of trees, the protesters built treehouses and small forts, occupying the park for three months in the dead of winter. Today, Gählerpark is a quiet patch of green surrounded by blocks of flats. But during the occupation it was a hub of activity: banners were strung from branches reading: “This park belongs to us all!” and “Save the trees!” – and a steady stream of visitors came trundling down the park’s slippery paths and through the snow, bringing food and supplies to the occupiers. “It was wonderful!” exclaims Astrid Matthiae, a long-term local resident and activist in the Moorburgtrasse Stoppen! campaign against the pipeline, as she retraces her steps through the park, pointing out trees that were once scheduled to be cut down, and shivering theatrically at memories of that winter’s cold, damp and freezing winds. The Gählerpark occupation was about much more than protecting local green space, however: the pipeline at the centre of the dispute would have connected Hamburg to an already controversial coal-fired power plant, under construction by Swedish energy giant Vattenfall across the river Elbe. Activists said the entire project was unacceptable because of climate change, and had to be stopped. The protesters came down from the trees in March 2010, after a court ruled to temporarily suspend the pipeline approval. But a spark had been lit: anger continued to grow over the prospect of a new coal plant in one of Europe’s “greenest cities” and demands for greater local control over Hamburg’s energy system became increasingly mainstream. Three years later, a mass campaign by dozens of environmental, consumer and religious groups culminated in a September 2013 referendum. And with a narrow majority, Germany’s second-largest city voted to take all available steps to completely take over the electricity, gas, and district heating networks that it had sold to Vattenfall and German energy company E.On only decades earlier. In the process, Hamburg joined a growing number of cities worldwide deciding to end their experiments with privatisation. Since 2007, 170 municipalities in Germany alone have brought energy services back into public hands. Globally, at least 100 cities have done the same with privatised water services over the past 15 years, including dozens of municipalities in France – once seen as a growing focus for water privatisation. Some describe this little-known trend – called “remunicipalisation” in academic jargon – as a worldwide, local-level backlash against the period of neoliberalism under which basic services have for the past 30 years been subject to mass privatisation. Hamburg is the largest city in Germany to decide to buy back its privatised energy services; a similar referendum to remunicipalise energy in Berlin failed, though the city did vote to buy back its water services in 2011. Germany’s northern industrial capital might have seemed an unlikely setting for such a move: Hamburg has been a hub for global trade and commerce for hundreds of years, and its port is still among the world’s largest, handling much of Europe’s imports and exports. But last year Hamburgers decided that not everything should be left to the market – by voting to buy back the city’s energy grids, they chose to end one of their largest experiments in privatisation. “In Germany, every month there is a new town that is buying back its energy infrastructure. This is very common right now,” said Christian Maas, former state secretary for the environment and urban planning in Hamburg. “People are interested in local energy supply and that is contradictory to the centralised, high profit-orientated large utility.” Satoko Kishimoto, co-ordinator of the water justice project at the Transnational Institute in Amsterdam, pointed to recent cases in the water sector in Africa and Asia, from Mozambique to Malaysia: “This is not a minor trend: many municipalities have been disappointed with privatisation, with costs, with service quality,” she said. “Remunicipalisation is seen as a tangible response, a way to rebuild important social services, more democratically.” “A lot of it has been happening off the radar screen,” said David McDonald, professor at Queen’s University in Canada and co-director of the Municipal Services Project international research network. “We have had this massive trend since the 1970s towards privatisation - an ideologically driven, powerful trend - which has created enormous debates. But now we are starting to see something happen, including outright reversals.” In Hamburg, activists launched the Unser Hamburg, Unser Netz (Our Hamburg, Our Networks) campaign in 2010 after noticing that the city’s existing contracts with Vattenfall and E.On were set to expire. The campaign brought out a wide range of supporters: environmental groups said buying back the grids would give Hamburg more control over its energy systems, and make it possible to really drive the city’s Energiewende transition away from coal and nuclear power and towards renewable energy. Consumer organisations, meanwhile, argued that Vattenfall and E.On were at the same time the owners of the energy networks, and primary producers and buyers of energy - a bad situation for competition and for consumers. Religious and anti-poverty groups added that energy networks should not be the object of private property, but run as public resources instead. Remunicipalisation rallies brought middle-aged men in crisp suits out alongside students and dreadlocked musicians. There is little international research on remunicipalisation and no exact figure of how many have already happened, or how many are under way. But a list of 180 known cases in the water sector, compiled by the Public Services International Research Unit (PSIRU) at the University of Greenwich and the Transnational Institute, includes cities in every region: from Bordeaux, France and Bielefeld, Germany to Budapest (Hungary), Buenos Aires (Argentina), and Badung Bali (Indonesia). McDonald sketches out a range of motives: “In the US, a movement for in-sourcing has often come from very conservative governments who see they can save money by bringing things back in-house. Sometimes cities have no choice – nobody is actually bidding for the contracts. Sometimes private contractors leave. And other times there are political movements, grassroots protests to get private companies out for different reasons.” There are still some cities, however, where little mention is ever made of remunicipalisation as a serious policy option. In the UK, a serious movement to remunicipalise like other major European cities has yet to emerge. “There are some isolated critical voices, but the main three political parties are basically OK with the status quo, linked up with the Washington consensus – that the private sector is efficient and this is not questionable,” said Emanuele Lobina, principal lecturer with the PSIRU. Lobina says bringing water services in England back into public hands could yield savings in the range of £900m a year and that these resources could help tackle rising water poverty. He blamed what he calls a “Westminster consensus” for ignoring “all empirical evidence of the possible savings that could be achieved through remunicipalisation, and the problems of water privatisation in England and Wales”. Cities can face a range of obstacles, said McDonald, in trying to regain control of once-public services: “Getting everyone on board can be very challenging. You can have very strong internal resistance. There can also be high legal costs, and companies suing for loss of contracts … [And] if you’ve had a private company delivering services for 10 or 20 years, you may no longer have trucks, or an IT system.” “It can be a very David and Goliath battle, if you’re thinking of ending a contract with a big company,” he warned. In Hamburg, the referendum to remunicipalise passed, but narrowly - with just 50.9% of the vote. “It was a really tough political fight. It was very, very long-running and in the end it was a very, very close referendum,” said Jens Kerstan, head of the Green party in Hamburg. A similar referendum in Berlin, also over the remunicipalisation of energy services, failed narrowly just two months after Hamburg’s vote. The motorways running in and out of Hamburg are lined with giant windmills, slowly churning the air, constant reminders of the country’s ambitious green goals. Shifting the city’s energy transition into higher gear was one of the key promises of remunicipalisation. The referendum ballot proposed not only to take back the city’s energy grids, but to institute as a binding target “a socially just, democratically controlled and climate-friendly energy supply from renewable sources”. Maas said the big private companies in town hadn’t wanted to touch small, decentralised energy projects. Remunicipalisation, on the other hand, offers the chance to “give something to the city, change the energy system, provide stable energy prices for the people, make the city less dependent on foreign imports and fossil fuels”. Ahead of the referendum, Hamburg had already bought back a 25.1% interest in the energy grids, but campaigners said this was not enough: only a complete take-over would give the city the power to do things differently. Nothing is happening overnight, however, as the city is waiting for its existing contracts with the energy companies to expire - a process that will take several years. In February 2014, Hamburg closed a deal to pay Vattenfall €550m to buy the city’s electricity grid from the company. Karen Kristina Hillmer, Vattenfall’s spokesperson in Hamburg, said the price was determined by jointly appointed external experts, and based on common valuation standards. “The agreement is a fair deal for both Vattenfall and for the city of Hamburg and its citizens,” she said. “Although Vattenfall has not disconnected from the electricity grid easily, this agreement avoids disputes and provides a good basis for a long-term future for Vattenfall in the region of Hamburg and a continued good co-operation with Hamburg.” The contract for Hamburg’s gas network is up next in 2015. But it will probably be 2019 before the much more valuable district heating grid is back in public hands. In this case, Günther Hörmann, at the Consumer Centre of Hamburg, warned that there was real concern that the city might be overpaying to take it back. Reports suggest the pricetag could exceed €1bn. • Claire Provost and Matt Kennard are fellows at the Centre for Investigative Journalism in London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/apr/28/alstom-bid-french-president-francois-hollande-meets-ge-siemens","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-28T16:15:40Z","webTitle":"French president meets rival German and US bidders for Alstom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/28/alstom-bid-french-president-francois-hollande-meets-ge-siemens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/apr/28/alstom-bid-french-president-francois-hollande-meets-ge-siemens","fields":{"headline":"French president meets rival German and US bidders for Alstom","bodyText":"François Hollande met rival German and US bidders for Alstom, one of France's biggest industrial groups, on Monday amid concerns that it could fall into American hands. At a hastily called meeting at the Elysée Palace, the French president talked to representatives from General Electric and Munich-based Siemens and General Electric in a move to protect French jobs at the group that makes the French rail network's TGV trains and the Pendolino fleet used by Virgin Trains, as well as owning an energy business. The loss of Alstom to a US buyer would be a political and public blow to the country's beleaguered and unpopular Socialist administration, with the interest of Siemens viewed as a route to a more acceptable compromise. Hours before Monday's meeting, several government ministers were summoned by Hollande to discuss the future of the company. The French state sold its interest in Alstom in 2006 and has little power to intervene directly, but Hollande and his ministers have made it clear they prefer a European rather than US solution to Alstom's difficulties, and expect to be closely consulted about the its future. The discussions centre on whether Siemens will relinquish its transport arm to Alstom in return for the French company handing over its energy division, to create what one Siemens source told Le Monde would be \"two European champions; one in energy, the other in transport\". The French government stepped in last week after it emerged that talks between Alstom and GE were already at an advanced stage. The US company had offered around €10bn (£8.2bn) for Alstom's energy unit, which accounts for 70% of group revenues and whose products include coal-powered turbines. Hollande said on Monday night that the French state had an interest in what happened to Alstom, \"because the state places orders [for] a certain number of purchases in sectors that are strategic, namely energy. That's the reason the state uses its position and why everyone understands this … and so that the offers are improved regarding jobs and activities carried out in France.\" Speaking to a gathering of local administrative chiefs, he said: \"Those who thought that it would be the market that determined my choices, that it would be solely private individuals who might use agreements and contracts to override the general interest, were wrong. \"The French are very attached to their state, and they want an efficient state.\" The economy minister, Arnaud Montebourg, who had warned of \"patriotic\" concerns over a GE deal last week, told France's RTL radio on Monday he would not accept that \"in three days, Alstom can decide to sell … a national jewel behind the backs of the employees, the government, most of the board and senior executives\". Describing the situation as unacceptable, Montebourg said: \"French firms are not prey. However, we are prepared to make alliances enabling us to face global competition. In the last few days we have taken several initiatives, the first being to reject a fait accompli.\" Around three-quarters of Alstom's portfolio is in the energy sector – the company also makes steam turbines for nuclear power plants – and it employs 93,000 people around the world, including 18,000 in France. Following the French government's obvious disquiet over GE's offer, Siemens wrote to Alstom's management at the weekend saying it was ready \"to discuss future strategic opportunities\". Siemens had expressed an interest in its rival Alstom's energy holdings in 2004 – around the time the French government ordered a bailout to save the group and it shed its shipbuilding interests – but its advances were rebuffed. Two years later the government sold its stake in the company. In spite of intense pressure from the government, Patrick Kron, Alstom's chief executive, is opposed to any partnership or takeover by the German company. Following Siemens' counter-offensive, Alstom announced that dealing in its shares on the French stock exchange would be suspended for two days of \"strategic reflection\". A decision is expected on Wednesday. It said in a statement: \"Alstom is continuing and deepening its strategic reflection and will inform the market some time before the morning of Wednesday 30 April. As a result, the company has asked that trading in its shares remains suspended.\" Hollande met the head of GE, Jeff Immelt, on Monday morning and was scheduled to meet the president of Siemens, Joe Kaeser, later. Martin Bouygues, Alstom's main shareholder with a 29.4% stake in the company, was due for talks at the Elysée on Monday evening. After the meeting Immelt issued a statement saying: \"The talks were open, friendly and productive … it was important to hear in person President Hollande's point of view and to discuss our plans. We have agreed to work together.\" The economist Nicolas Bouzou said the government's only weapon was verbal pressure, and said he feared the French state's bullish approach to GE would have the opposite effect to that desired. He told the newspaper Le Parisien: \"The state's position is legitimate, given that the government wants to protect a company that is in the strategic sectors of transport and energy, but acting for the sake of public opinion is no good. Some back room diplomacy would be better.\" Montebourg told Le Monde: \"Alstom is a symbol of France's industrial power and our ingenuity. The government is concerned and urges patriotic vigilance.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2013/oct/29/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-29T19:02:33Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/oct/29/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2013/oct/29/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A report about the most distant galaxy detected by astronomers said that it had a mass of 1bn suns and was 40bn to 50bn times lighter than the Milky Way.

Here’s a quick rundown of the biggest news from the presidential campaign trail today: Hillary Clinton ducked into the New York City subway in an apparent wink at rival Bernie Sanders, who incorrectly told the New York Daily News last week that you “get a token” to ride the train. The subway system switched over to flimsy plastic cards in 2003. Former pediatric neurosurgeon and onetime presidential candidate Ben Carson once again made a grab for the title of worst surrogate ever. Speaking on CNN, Carson said that there were “probably” better choices out there than Donald Trump for president (reminder: Carson has endorsed Trump). In response to a question about criminal charges being filed against Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Carson told co-host John Berman that he’d probably had charges filed against him too. Meanwhile, Ohio governor John Kasich attempted to eat his way to the Republican nomination at a New York deli: Donald Trump hired lobbyist Paul Manafort, whose past client list includes the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych and a group tied to Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos, as “convention manager.” Manafort helped Gerald Ford win a 1976 convention fight and helped with convention planning on the 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign. Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, accused Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders of “blood libel” for Sanders’ suggestion in a New York Daily News interview last Friday that Israel had killed more than 10,000 innocent Palestinians during the last Gaza war. Sanders reportedly held a phone conversation with Anti-Defamation League chief Jonathan A. Greenblatt later today, in which he “clarified” his recollection that there were 10,000 civilian deaths, calling them inaccurate. “The Anti-Defamation League today welcomed the clarification by presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of his misstatement about Palestinian casualties during the 2014 conflict between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas,” the non-profit, which combats anti-Semitism, said in a statement. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani endorsed Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, telling The New York Post that “I support Trump. I’m gonna vote for Trump.” The Trump campaign called the endorsement from “America’s Mayor” “such a great honor.” Given their romantic history, it seems like it was a done deal... Bernie Sanders told CBS’s Charlie Rose that his suggestion that Hillary Clinton is not “qualified” to be president was merely a response to attacks from her campaign. “All I am saying, if the people are gonna attack us, if they’re gonna distort our record, as has been the case time and time again, we’re gonna respond.” Sanders said. That’s it for tonight - tune in tomorrow, the next day and every day after that to get up-to-the-minute coverage from the campaign trail. In most states, delegate support is dictated by results in individual counties, congressional districts or, in the case of winner-take-all states, the victor of the state’s support. But in Colorado, Republicans don’t get primaries or caucuses - which means that 21 of the state’s 37 delegates have been up for grabs at district conventions. Each of Colorado’s seven congressional districts picks three delegates and three alternates to attend the national convention in Cleveland this summer. Of the two districts that have already held their conventions, both were swept by Texas senator Ted Cruz, who now has six delegates from Colorado to his name. Tonight, the Colorado 7th elects its delegates, where the Guardian’s Ben Jacobs reports that certain candidates’ ground operation are showing cracks: Vermont senator and Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders told CBS’s Charlie Rose that his suggestion that former secretary of state Hillary Clinton is not “qualified” to be president was merely a response to attacks from her campaign. “All I am saying, if the people are gonna attack us, if they’re gonna distort our record, as has been the case time and time again, we’re gonna respond.” Sanders said, defending himself against the argument that the tenor of the Democratic contest has become too heated. “I have never run a negative ad in my life,” Sanders said. “In this campaign, as I’m sure you can appreciate, every other day people are coming up to me and saying ‘Aren’t you gonna attack Hillary Clinton? Aren’t you gonna attack the Clinton Foundation?’ And you know how many times I’ve done that? Zero.” When Rose asked Sanders whether he truly felt that Clinton, a former secretary of state, senator and first lady, was unqualified to occupy the Oval Office, Sanders acknowledged that Clinton “has years of experience [and] is extremely intelligent,” and still preferable as a White House occupant over potential Republican nominees Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. “I think the idea of a Donald Trump or a Ted Cruz presidency would be an unmitigated disaster for this country,” Sanders said. “I will do everything in my power and work as hard as I can to make sure that that does not happen, and if Secretary Clinton is the nominee, I will certainly support her.” Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz told CNN’s Dana Bash that an apology to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for calling him a liar last July “ain’t gonna happen” anytime soon. “If the Washington lobbyists want to see that happen, they can hold their breath a long, long time,” Cruz said. “My focus is on the American people.” Cruz delivered the broadside in a speech on the Senate floor after claiming that McConnell had given that there was no deal to allow a vote to renew the federal Export-Import Bank. Fox News Channel personality Geraldo Rivera accused Texas senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz of anti-Semitism on The O’Reilly Factor this evening, saying that his now-infamous “New York values” advertisement and commentary was a coded slur against American Jews. “Aside from the stinking anti-Semitic implications that I see in that whole ‘New York values’ money- and media-coated message that he put out there pandering to those Iowa voters, he also voted against Hurricane Sandy relief,” Rivera said. “He also voted against compensation for 9/11 victims. This is a man whose interests are absolutely antithetical to New York.” O’Reilly, for his part, pushed back against the allegation. “If he says ‘New York Values’ to a bunch of Evangelicals, its not anti-Semitic,” O’Reilly said. “He could have very easily said that,” Rivera rebuked. “There’s a million ways he could have said that that he did not.” A White House spokesman has come to the defense of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, rebutting a claim by her primary opponent Bernie Sanders that she is not “qualified” to be president. “The president has said that Secretary Clinton comes into this race with more experience than any other non-vice president in recent campaign history,” White House spokesperson Eric Schultz told reporters aboard Air Force One, according to The Hill. Schultz added the president was “fortunate” enough to have Clinton as his secretary of State for four years, when they “worked together on complicated, on complex issues.” Returning to the institution where he taught constitutional law for over a decade,Barack Obama today said Republicans were pursuing a path that “erodes the institutional integrity of the judicial branch” by refusing to consider his supreme court nominee, Merrick Garland. Addressing students in a discussion at the University of Chicago Law School, the president said his pick to replace the late justice Antonin Scalia was “as good of a judge as we have in this country” and deserved a fair hearing. “He embodies and models what we want to see in our jurisprudence,” Obama said of Garland, chief judge of the US court of appeals for the DC circuit. His remarks came as the Republican leadership in the US Senate remained steadfast in its opposition to filling the supreme court vacancy under Obama’s watch. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, declared earlier this week that it was “safe to say” there would be neither a vote nor a hearing on Garland’s nomination. That position, Obama warned, threatened the core of American democracy. “If you start getting into a situation in which the process of appointing judges is so broken, so partisan, that an eminently qualified jurist cannot even get a hearing, we are going to see the kind of sharp polarization that has come to characterize our electoral politics seeping into the system,” Obama said. Some bad polling news for Donald Trump: Seven in ten people view the billionaire Republican frontrunner negatively, including almost half of Republicans, according to a new survey from the Associated Press. The voter antipathy cuts across nearly every demographic: men, women, whites, blacks, young people, old people, conservatives, moderates and liberals all told the Associated Press that they have an unfavorable view of Trump. Even among white voters with no college degree, often seen as the backbone of Trump’s support, the candidate is viewed negatively by 55% of likely voters. It’s an 11-point increase since the same question was asked in February. Texas senator Ted Cruz is getting a hefty dose of New York attitude from opponents eager to hamper his efforts in the Empire State’s upcoming Republican primary. After lambasting billionaire frontrunner - and Queens native - Donald Trump in a February campaign ad that knocked his “New York values,” and doubling down on the remarks in a high-profile debate dustup with the real-estate tycoon, Cruz’s words are coming back to bite him. Trump, whose remarks in support of New York’s spirit after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were a rare moment of idealism from the candidate, has been keen to rip on Cruz for his past derogations against the state. During a rally in Bethpage, Long Island, last night, Trump highlighted those remarks to the 12,000-strong audience of supporters. “Do you remember during the debate when he started lecturing me on New York values, like we’re no good?” Trump asked. “We all know people that died, and I’ve got this guy looking at me with scorn in his face, with hatred of New York! So, folks, I think you can forget about him.” Even the non-New Yorker in the Republican field is now pressing Cruz on his remarks. In a new ad titled Values put out by the campaign of Ohio governor John Kasich, a narrator reminds viewers that “Cruz sneered at our New York values,” with the camera panning over such New York icons as Times Square, the Statue of Liberty and the Tribute in Light. “Ted Cruz divides to get a vote,” the narrator says. “John Kasich unites to get things done.” If the reaction of real New Yorkers is any indication, the attacks are working. At Trump’s Long Island rally, the crowd responded to reminders about Cruz’s “New York values” comments by chanting “Lyin’ Ted! Lyin’ Ted! Lyin’ Ted!” The mayor of New York lambasted him for “hypocrisy”; one of the city’s iconic tabloids told him to take the “FU Train”; a planned visit to a Bronx high school was cancelled after a highly organized student group threatened to walk out of class if the senator appeared on campus. The dislike appears to have borne out in polling, as well. Cruz falls behind both Trump and Kasich in the most recent polling of likely New York Republican voters. New Hampshire senator Kelly Ayotte told a home-state radio host today that she would back billionaire Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump if he were to become the party’s nominee. “What I have said is that, at this point, I plan to support our Republican nominee,” Ayotte said. “That said, I gotta tell you, I don’t know who that’s gonna be. I think that this is far from over, this process still has to play out, and I want to see what happens at this convention, obviously.” When pressed by host Dan Mitchell to say whether she would support Trump, Ayotte stood firm. “I plan to support our Republican nominee.” It’s a bold stance for a senator whose seat has been seen as one of the most vulnerable in the upcoming general election. Although Trump won the New Hampshire primary with the support of 35% of the electorate, his presence at the top of the ticket may pose a threat to the Republican majority in the senate. The Indian Point Energy Center, a controversial and ageing nuclear plant near New York City, has split the Democratic presidential candidates. As campaigning continues, Bernie Sanders called the facility “a catastrophe waiting to happen”. Hillary Clinton said only that it needed more oversight. “In my view, we cannot sit idly by and hope that the unthinkable will never happen,” Sanders said in a statement. “It makes no sense to me to continue to operate a decaying nuclear reactor within 25 miles of New York City where nearly 10 million people live.” The Vermont senator elaborated on his stance, calling for the US to phase out nuclear plants along with more polluting resources such as fossil fuels. “Nuclear power is and always has been a dangerous idea because there is no good way to store nuclear waste,” he said. Clinton, a former New York senator, accused Sanders of tardiness in his attention to the controversial plant. “I’m glad he discovered Indian Point,” she told a local talkshow, Capital Tonight. “We also have to be realistic and say, ‘You get 25% of the electricity in the greater New York City area from Indian Point.’ “I don’t want middle-class taxpayers to see a huge rate increase. So this needs to be done in a careful, thoughtful way.” After calling on Vermont senator Bernie Sanders to correct a statement he made to the New York Daily News regarding casualties in the 2014 war in Gaza, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has released a statement welcoming Sanders’ “clarification” on the issue. “The Anti-Defamation League today welcomed the clarification by presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of his misstatement about Palestinian casualties during the 2014 conflict between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas,” the non-profit, which combats anti-Semitism, said in a statement. Sanders reportedly held a phone conversation with ADL chief Jonathan A. Greenblatt in which he “clarified” his recollection that there were 10,000 civilian deaths, calling them inaccurate. “The senator assured me that he did not mean his remarks to be a definitive statement and that he would make every effort to set the record straight,” Greenblatt said in the release. “We appreciate his responsiveness on this issue, especially at a time when there are many false and incendiary reports blaming Israel for applying disproportionate force in its struggle for self-defense.” The United Nations’ independent commission of inquiry into the 2014 Gaza conflict found that 2,251 were killed in Gaza. Roughly 65% were estimated to be civilians. Bill Clinton struggled to handle protesters in Philadelphia on Thursday, after a group briefly took the spotlight from him with chants and signs against the Clintons’ politics. The mostly African-American demonstrators shouted down the former president at several moments, and said that he and spouse Hillary Clinton contributed to the surge of incarcerations in the 1990s, mostly of black men. Clinton signed a crime bill in 1994 that sharply increased sentences for minor offenses, and last year the former president himself said the law did too much harm. He admitted no regret in Philadelphia, however, and defended the bill from protesters who held signs reading “Clinton Crime Bill Destroyed Our Communities”. Another held a sign that said “Black Youth Are Not Super Predators”, an allusion to his wife’s 1996 remark about “the kinds of kids that are called super predators”. “No conscience, no empathy,” the then-first lady said at the time, referring to a debunked and racially charged theory. “We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.” Twenty years later and after a confrontation with a protester, Clinton acknowledged the words were poorly chosen. “Looking back, I shouldn’t have used those words, and I wouldn’t use them today,” she said in a statement. Her husband defended her today, saying: “I don’t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13 year old kids hopped up on crack, and sent them out onto the street to murder other African-American children.” “Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didn’t.” Clinton also defended his own achievements at length, including an expired ban on assault weapons and welfare reform bill that is now criticized for unwise cuts that have actually contributed to increased poverty. Chief among those critics is Bernie Sanders, the rival candidate for Democratic nominee and a champion of fighting inequality. “They say the welfare reform bill increased poverty,” Clinton said. “Then why did we have the largest drop in African American poverty in history when I was president?” The number of families living in extreme poverty has increased by 130% since 1996, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Michigan. Some groups, including single-mother households, benefited more from the reform bill than others. The former president also noted that his wife had no voting power in the government at the time. “Hillary didn’t vote for that bill cause she wasn’t in the Senate, she was spending her time trying to get healthcare for poor kids.” Clinton admitted “it’s also true that there are too many people” in federal and state prisons, and said that his wife, along with Sanders and Republicans, are eager to reform the justice system. Eventually, Clinton gave up on his various attempts to engage, placate and rebut the protesters, and opted for changing the subject: “I’ll tell you another story about where black lives matter: Africa.” One of the protesters spoke with reporters after the rally, saying she resented the treatment showed her by the former president and Clinton supporters. “We silently held our signs up and we have a right to do that,” Erica Miles said. “People attack us and we become the thugs.” “I’m not here to say that Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton is not a good person. Their politics have hurt the black community, that’s all that is. This is not about whether I like them.” Senate pro tem Orrin Hatch told reporters this afternoon that there is “potential” for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan to be picked as a compromise candidate at a contested Republican national convention this July, calling him “one of the great leaders” that would unify a divided party. “I think it’s just natural that that speculation would happen because he’s one of the great leaders here on Capitol Hill and one of the people who brings both sides, all sides together, I should say,” Hatch said, according to The Hill. The senior senator noted that although Ryan, a former vice presidential nominee, is “a very, very fine human being,” there was no organized effort to draft him into openly campaigning for the nomination. A Rasmussen survey released earlier today may put a damper on Hatch’s enthusiasm, however: In hypothetical head-to-head match-ups with former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Ryan loses the general election by a minimum of six points. Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs sends along this statement from Donald Trump on the news of the Rudy Giuliani endorsement profession of intent to vote for Trump (it’s not an endorsement, Giuliani says). Statement via the Trump campaign: Everyone has tremendous respect for Rudy Giuliani and this is such a great honor. Rudy knows me well and therefore it is an even greater honor than it would normally be. Bill Clinton appeared in Philadelphia this afternoon to stump for Hillary Clinton. But then he was confronted by a heckler with a “Hillary Clinton is a murderer” sign –which developed into what appears to have been a pretty intense showdown with the crowd. We have video and a longer report on the way... “I support Trump. I’m gonna vote for Trump,” former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani told The New York Post on Thursday, the newspaper reported. The 9/11 mayor and former Republican presidential candidate had kept his preference in the race a secret, against intense media interest and, one assumes, no small amount of lobbying by the candidates. There’s reason to think that Giuliani could help Trump gain traction among Republicans voting in the primary. But if Trump makes the general, the kiss of Rudy may decline in value. Republicans polled in 2013 after Giuliani endorsed Republican mayoral candidate Joe Lhota (who would go on to lose to Bill de Blasio) said Giuliani’s endorsement made a difference in a positive way. “Most Republicans — 72% — say a Giuliani endorsement makes them more likely to vote for Lhota while 8% report it makes them less inclined to support him,” a Marist poll found. “Among Democrats, 57% think Giuliani’s backing makes them less likely to cast their ballot for Lhota.” Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, has accused Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders of “blood libel” for Sanders’ suggestion in a New York Daily News interview last Friday that Israel had killed more than 10,000 innocent Palestinians during the last Gaza war. “First of all, he should get his facts right. Secondly, he owes Israel an apology,” Oren, now a member of the Knesset, told the Times of Israel in an interview. “He accused us of a blood libel. He accused us of bombing hospitals. He accused us of killing 10,000 Palestinian civilians. Don’t you think that merits an apology?” Sanders’ take in the Daily News interview on the 2014 conflict was more inflected than Oren allowed, but he did mention the number 10,000. From the transcript: Daily News: Do you support the Palestinian leadership’s attempt to use the International Criminal Court to litigate some of these issues to establish that, in their view, Israel had committed essentially war crimes? Sanders: No. Daily News: Why not? Sanders: Why not? Daily News: Why not, why it... Sanders: Look, why don’t I support a million things in the world? I’m just telling you that I happen to believe...anybody help me out here, because I don’t remember the figures, but my recollection is over 10,000 innocent people were killed in Gaza. Does that sound right? Daily News: I think it’s probably high, but we can look at that. Sanders: I don’t have it in my number...but I think it’s over 10,000. My understanding is that a whole lot of apartment houses were leveled. Hospitals, I think, were bombed. So yeah, I do believe and I don’t think I’m alone in believing that Israel’s force was more indiscriminate than it should have been. Daily News: Okay. We will check the facts. I don’t want to venture a number that I’m not sure on, but we will check those facts. Hamas said that over 1,000 civilians were killed in the Gaza conflict, a figure which the Israeli government disputes. Sanders, who once lived in Israel, used the 1,000 figure in a foreign policy speech in March when he also acknowledged “Hamas’ use of civilian neighborhoods to launch those attacks.” The criticism from Oren is particularly striking as the former ambassador is a former academic and a political centrist in Israel. The Guardian reported in July 2014 that four hospitals had been hit in the conflict. Israeli officials dispute the numbers and said fighters were operating at civilian sites. Donald Trump has hired lobbyist Paul Manafort, whose past client list includes the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych and a group tied to Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos, as “convention manager.” Manafort, who maintains one of multiple residences in the Trump Tower in Manhattan, helped Gerald Ford win a 1976 convention fight and helped with convention planning on the 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign, according to a Washington Post profile. A Trump statement announcing the hire sought to head off speculation that the rise of Manafort meant a lesser position for Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski or his lieutenant. “The nomination process has reached a point that requires someone familiar with the complexities involved in the final stages,” Trump’s statement said. I am organizing these responsibilities under someone who has done this job successfully in many campaigns. This will allow the rest of my team to deal with the increasing needs of a national campaign for both the pre-Convention phase and most importantly, the general election. Paul is a well-respected expert in this regard and we are pleased to have him join the efforts to Make America Great Again. (h/t: @bencjacobs) Megan Carpentier finds some voters impressed with Senator Ted Cruz after his appearance at the Mekeel Christian Academy in Scotia, NY today. But a couple Cruz calls – for “more meat” in school lunches and for reining in the EPA – seemed poorly tailored to the local audience, she reports: Cruz was nearly 45 minutes late for his rally, but the residents of New York’s Capital District who came from miles around to hear him speak – there were so many people that the organizers had many of them park outside of the small village’s downtown and bussed them in on yellow school buses – hardly seemed to mind. When Cruz finally came into the school’s tiny gym, the audience took to their feet to cheer and stayed there for his entire speech. They were treated to a rousing version of the stump speech he gave last Friday night at Serb Hall in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, about “jobs, freedom and security” – with a few additions meant to highlight his electability. The crowd, which cheered loudest at his (many) mentions of the US constitution, was slightly less enthusiastic about his promise to “rein in the EPA”. That’s possibly because residents are aware that the EPA-managed SuperFund program forced General Electric to remove tons of PCBs from the Husdon River (which the company reportedly knew were dangerous long before they admitted so publicly), the Clean Water Act helped reverse some of the impacts of pollution along the Mohawk River but problems remain, and it was the EPA that finally warned Hoosick Falls residents not to drink the heavily contaminated village water after state and local officials dragged their feet. And though he held his event at the town’s lone private school (founded in 1974, and housed in the local public school’s former junior high school building), Cruz’s only mention of education policy was to promise the students “if Heidi becomes First Lady, meat is coming back to the cafeteria.” (Down the road at Scotia-Glenville Senior High School, cafeteria staff were at that very moment preparing to serve to students a “mashed potato and chicken bowl”, pizza with the options of pepperoni or “seasoned fajita chicken”, burgers, two types of chicken sandwiches and a variety of deli sandwiches with meats including turkey, ham, tuna and chicken. This alumni can confirm that students today have far more meat options than when she attended SGHS; I can assure the Cruz family that no return to the school lunches of yesteryear is necessary or likely desired.) Still, the voters seemed impressed. Victoria, who declined to give her last name, from Niskayuna, NY, said after the speech “He’s young, handsome and smart”; Cruz signed her copy of his book as he worked the rope line in short sleeves. Karen, who also declined to give her last name, drove in from Fulton County bedecked in an American flag sweater, American flag rhinestone earrings and an American flag necklace. She’ll be voting for Cruz in the state’s primary, she said, “And he’s got to beat Hillary.” Bill Dussault, who across the Mohawk River in Rotterdam, NY, identifies as an independent and said, “I came to see what he had to say, and liked what he said.” Who he does not like is Donald Trump: “He seems to have an ego problem, and I just don’t like that at all.” He hasn’t yet made up his mind, but he’s leaning towards voting for Cruz in the primary. As they left the school, attendees were treated to a sheet scrawled with the words “GO HOME LYIN’ TED” hung on a fence across the street; it was manned by two male Trump fans in the mid-twenties. Those Cruzers who were left waiting down the block for the bus to take them back to their cars had to stare at a neighbor’s porch banner; it read “Hillary in 2016”. WOW. That would be Mike’s Deli on Arthur Ave in the Bronx. Kasich better save some room for Bay Ridge. Can the Ohio governor eat his way to the nomination? Trump has canceled an event in California in order to focus on the New York contest in the run-up to voting on 19 April, CNN reports. The majority of New York’s 95 Republican delegates will be won in the 16 congressional districts (out of 27) making up New York City and Long Island. A haul of all 95 for Trump would expand his delegate lead over Cruz by more than 40%. California, which also awards Republican delegates per congressional district, votes on 7 June. The LA Times has more on the cancellation here. The gloves might be off, but Hillary Clinton isn’t throwing the punches. The former secretary of state has so far declined to fire back at her opponent Bernie Sanders for questioning whether she is “qualified” to be president. She brushed off the comment this morning, calling it a “silly thing to say” when asked by reporters during a trip to the Bronx. “I don’t know why he’s saying that but I will take Bernie Sanders over Ted Cruz or Donald Trump any time,” she added. But her campaign staff and allies are fighting back hard against – and fundraising off of – Sanders’s most recent attacks. Brian Fallon, Clinton’s national press secretary, demanded that Sanders “take back your words”. Sanders did not. Instead, his campaign sent out a press release that outlined the reasons why Clinton is not qualified to be president, including her Iraq war vote and campaign donations from “special interest funds”. Thought Clinton did not specifically say Sanders is “unqualified” to be president, she and her campaign have countered his rise by painting him as a progressive pipe-dream with big ideas and little chance of achieving them. Over the weekend, she said she “feel[s] sorry” for young people who believe Sanders’ claims that she takes money from the fossil fuel industry. Christina Reynolds, the campaign’s deputy communications director, told supporters in a fundraising email that Sanders had “crossed a line”. In a statement, Emily’s List president Stephanie Schriock called Clinton “one of the most qualified people ever to run for president of the United States”. “Anyone can talk a big game about what they would do if they were president. Not everyone, as Senator Sanders has demonstrated, can tell us how they would do any of it,” she said. Update: Here’s video of that Ben Carson moment on CNN in which he suggests that co-host John Berman has “been charged with something.” “I actually haven’t,” Berman replies. Hundreds of new documents relating to Donald Trump’s arms-length friendship with the Clintons are due to be published: Meanwhile, back in Washington: Megan Carpentier continues her dispatches from Ted Cruz’s town halls in Scotia, New York: Someone brought an Israeli flag to the Cruz rally in Scotia, NY just to wave during Cruz’s promise to support Israel. Ted Cruz just cracked a (recycled) joke about how often Democrats commit voter fraud. Hardee-har-har. Ben Carson, the retired presidential candidate and neurosurgeon who has endorsed Donald Trump for president, makes another claim to the title of worst surrogate ever. Speaking on CNN, Carson said that there were “probably” better choices out there than Donald Trump for president. Later, in response to a question about criminal charges being filed against Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Carson told co-host John Berman that he’d probably had charges filed against him too. Update: transcript: Last month Carson went on The View TV show and was confronted with a question about Trump being racist. “What’s the alternative?” Carson said. The president sent senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, one of two Republican senators to agree to meet with his Supreme Court nominee, a handwritten thank-you. Senator Susan Collins of Maine also met with DC circuit judge Merrick Garland. The Guardian’s Megan Carpentier is at a rally with Ted Cruz in her upstate hometown: Ted Cruz just promised that if Heidi becomes First Lady “meat is coming back to the cafeteria.” We’re at Mekeel Christian, a private school. In an onstage appearance Wednesday with Yahoo news host Katie Couric, Megyn Kelly, the Fox News host whom Donald Trump is fixated on, described how Trump tried to make friends before his presidential run. “He started reaching out more. He started calling me after segments,” Kelly says. She says Trump sent her clippings about her – signed by him. “I think he was trying to curry favor because he understood that he was going to be running for president,” Kelly says. “I didn’t ask him to call me. It was a nice gesture, but it’s not going to stop me from asking tough questions.” When the Brooklyn-born Vermont senator Bernie Sanders told the New York Daily News last Friday that it takes a “token” to ride the metro, he left the Chicago-born former New York senator an opening to flash her Big Apple bona fides. On Thursday, after a few swipes of her metro card, Hillary Clinton pushed her way the turnstile at 161st St station. She walked up the stairs and emerged at the outdoor platform. “It was my first term when we changed from tokens to Metro Cards,” Clinton said, gently knocking Sanders for his “tokengate” comment. She also took the opportunity to respond to Sanders’ comment from the night before that she is not “qualified” to be president. “Well it’s kind of a silly thing to say,” Clinton told reporters. “But I’m going to trust the voters of New York who know me and have voted for me three times.” She added: “Let’s keep our eye on what’s really at stake in this election.” The 4 train screeched to halt. Clinton, trailed by an entourage of staff and advisers, hopped on the train northbound to 170th St station after a visit to Yankee stadium. She said the last time she rode the subway was about two years ago, after her tenure as Secretary of State. When she emerged at 170th, Clinton walked the streets of the Bronx for some blocks. Unlike Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who was heckled by Bronx residents for criticizing “New York values” during a rally there, Clinton was greeted with smiles and cheers. She stopped often to shake hands and pose for photos with babies. ”I am so proud to have represented this state for eight years,” Clinton said. “I’m a proud New Yorker and I want to be a good president for New York and for the rest of the country. But New York values, the people of New York, there no place like it in the world,” she added, swiping Cruz. Her jaunt through the city’s northern borough was meant to show that she had no problem walking among the people. Earlier this week, Clinton challenged Republican frontrunner Donald Trump to “get out of one of his towers and actually walk the street”. After greeting supporters, Clinton slipped into Munch Time deli, where cameras were set up for an interview with NBC News. As she exited the deli supporters yelled out: “Hillary! The Bronx loves you!” After New York, Clinton will attend fundraisers in Ohio and Colorado. The Guardian’s Megan Carpentier is in position to take in a Ted Cruz town hall in Scotia, New York, outside Schenectady. Megan snaps a shot of one of two protesters to pop up at the event (the other is an anti-war protestor, she says): Hillary Clinton ducked into the New York City subway Thursday to thumb her nose at rival Bernie Sanders, who incorrectly told the Daily News last week that you “get a token” to ride the train. The subway system switched over to flimsy plastic cards in 2003. Update: the Republican political group America Rising is circulating video revealing that Clinton required multiple MetroCard swipes to pass the stiles. This never happens to city natives, except like half the time, especially if the card is more than a week old, although those auto-refill ones are a little stiffer and seem to work better. In one respect, the video below does make Clinton look like an out-of-towner, in the sense that the malfunctioning stile does not draw from her even a single audible imprecation. Clinton flies out of town this afternoon, with fundraisers scheduled for later today in Colorado and Ohio. Tomorrow she is holding a rally in Buffalo, NY. On the Republican side, Ted Cruz has an event scheduled in Albany for Friday morning. Ohio governor John Kasich, meanwhile, is in the Bronx this midday and at a Brooklyn town hall with Montel Williams tonight in Bay Ridge. Trump has no public events scheduled. This from Clinton’s traveling press secretary: Say what you will about Ted Cruz, he shows chutzpah. On Tuesday he told reporters in Wisconsin that he would arm the cheese curds. Now, seated in an incredibly uncrowded breakfast spot in New York – must’ve got an ‘F’ from the health department – he tells George Stephanopoulos that he does not regret slagging off Donald Trump’s “New York values”. Cruz, a Princeton and Harvard alum, may exaggerate his removal from New York and all it values. Last year, he made headlines for fundraising in Manhattan including one reception at the apartment of two prominent gay hoteliers, one of whom later got kicked out of a Fire Island bar for hosting Cruz, according to reports. Cruz’s wife, Heidi Cruz, is on leave from her post as managing director at Goldman Sachs, but she worked for them out of Houston. Hello, and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. Can Donald Trump top 50% in New York state – statewide, and then in each congressional district? A Monmouth University poll released late Wednesday had Trump at 52% support, John Kasich at 25% and Ted Cruz at 17%. The 50% mark is important because any candidate consistently crossing it would win a lion’s share of the state’s 95 delegates. That number would grow Trump’s delegates lead on Cruz by about 40%: Cruz won a Bronx cheer on the cover of today’s Daily News – a paper that has repeatedly tangled with Trump. Cruz was heckled in the New York City borough on Wednesday for his anti-immigrant views (see video here). Trump, meanwhile, received a jubilant welcome from supporters at a rally on Long Island Wednesday night. “It’s great to be home,” he said. Here’s the video: Thanks for joining us today and please let us know what’s cooking in your corner of the political world in the comments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/jul/18/iran-nuclear-talks-deadline","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-18T12:49:35Z","webTitle":"Iran nuclear talks: gaps remain as deadline approaches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/iran-nuclear-talks-deadline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jul/18/iran-nuclear-talks-deadline","fields":{"headline":"Iran nuclear talks: gaps remain as deadline approaches","bodyText":"Nuclear negotiations with Iran in Vienna stalled in recent weeks following disagreements over limits on Iran's enrichment capacity and how long those limits should last. All sides at the talks are prepared to extend them beyond Sunday's deadline, but an extension faces significant opposition in the US Congress. The proposed extension would last four months, but there is a dispute in Vienna over what the terms of that extension would be. Iran wants more of its assets from oil sales held in western banks to be unfrozen during the extended negotiation. The US wants Tehran to reduce its stockpile of enrichment in return. The argument has held up an announcement of the extended deadline, with US and Iranian officials haggling until 1am and resuming discussions later on Friday morning. Iranian negotiators put forward a compromise package over the past two months and have expressed frustration at what they portray as inflexibility on the part of the six world powers involved in the talks – the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, convened by the EU foreign policy chief, Cathy Ashton. The Iranian proposal, put forward by the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, involves freezing the country's capacity to enrich uranium at its current level, of about 10,000 centrifuges, for a period of seven years, after which it would be able to run a peaceful nuclear energy programme without special limits. The initial position taken by Washington, which is taking the lead in the six-nation negotiating group, is that Iran should reduce its capacity to 1,500 centrifuges for 20 years. When the US secretary of state, John Kerry, joined the talks on Sunday, that offer was increased to up to 6,000 but he did not compromise on the minimum 20-year lifespan for the special restrictions on the Iranian programme. Zarif is said to have argued that to dismantle centrifuges, closing down much of Iran's enrichment plants and therefore dismissing many of the people involved in the industry, would be seen as a stinging humiliation in Iranian eyes. He suggested an array of other measures aimed at reassuring the international community that Iran could not build a bomb at short notice, in just a few months. Those measures included converting almost all of Iran's stockpile of reactor-grade uranium from gas to an oxide solid of the sort used in nuclear power stations, and an agreement not to build the factory necessary to turn the solid back into a gas form which would be essential for enriching the uranium further to weapons grade. The Iranians argued that all those measures together would meet Washington's stated objective of making sure Iran could not build a weapon. Iranian officials have accused the Americans of focusing on just a couple of variables and being inflexible about those. Western officials argued that in maintaining their refusal to reduce enrichment capacity, it is the Iranians who are being inflexible. In the last few days of the talks, however, some hints at flexibility began to emerge, in which Iran would do more to disable the roughly 9,000 additional centrifuges it has on standby and both sides could find a compromise on the number of centrifuges operating during the freeze period. That was just about enough to justify an extension, but not enough to clinch a deal in the last few days remaining in Vienna. On other issues, there was more convergence. Iran offered to make design changes to the heavy water reactor it is building near the town of Arak, so that it produced 2kg of plutonium – another possible route to building a bomb – in its spent fuel each year, and agreed for the spent fuel to be exported. That was a reduction from the 9kg-a-year capacity of the old design. But the six-nation negotiating group wanted that reduced to 1kg a year. As for Iran's underground enrichment plant at Fordow, which the west wanted closed down, Iran suggested it could be used for research and development for small numbers of centrifuges under constant international supervision. Iran also signalled that it was willing to accept an enhanced inspection regime from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in which Tehran would comply with a rule requiring it to report any new nuclear projects at the point when they are first designed. It would sign an agreement called the additional protocol, allowing IAEA inspectors much more intrusive inspections. Lastly, the IAEA would be arbiter and monitor of whatever comprehensive deal is agreed between Iran and the six powers. Lastly, the Iranians have expressed willingness to consider entering joint ventures with foreign companies to build civilian nuclear reactors. Such joint ventures, they argue, would provide another level of confidence to the outside world that the programme is peaceful. On one issue, the Iranians are closer to the Americans than to the Europeans. Both Tehran and Washington want to resume negotiations in mid-August. The Europeans would prefer to take the whole of August off. In Washington, meanwhile, Barack Obama and Kerry have been struggling to convince a sceptical Congress to agree to an extension to the talks, hindered by the problem that they cannot fully illustrate their claims with details for fear they would leak and give away western and Iranian negotiating positions. The administration does not require congressional approval for more talks, but if the US legislature imposes more sanctions, it could torpedo the negotiations. The House of Representatives has already prepared a new sanctions bill that could be presented as early as Monday, although it is unlikely to be passed by the Senate. Iranian officials have said that in the event of more punitive measures, Tehran would no longer feel bound by an interim agreement struck in November, under which it has observed strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for the gradual unfreezing of its assets. Obama said this week there was a \"credible way forward\" in the negotiations, adding that there were \"still some significant gaps\" that required more work. Republicans and Democrats in Congress, however, have signalled that they view a prolongation of the talks as allowing Iran to play for time. The Republican chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, Ed Royce, highlighted the persistent of gaps between the two sides, and said he hoped \"the administration will finally engage in robust discussions with Congress about preparing additional sanctions against Iran\". The senior Democrat on the committee, Elliot Engel, also contradicted the administration in saying that the Iranian offer on the table \"doesn't give negotiators much to work with\". He said: \"After six months of negotiations, I'm disappointed that the Iranians continue posturing rather than working toward a real solution.\" Kelsey Davenport, a nonproliferation analyst at the US-based Arms Control Association, who has been monitoring the talks in Vienna, said: \"Significant progress has been made on a number of tough areas, and if both sides remain focused and are willing to consider creative solutions, they can bridge the remaining gaps with a short extension. Congress needs to do its part to help bridge those gaps … This is no time for posturing or playing bad cop. Policymakers must remember that the alternative to a good deal is an unconstrained Iranian nuclear programme with less international oversight.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/dec/03/david-cameron-protests-chinese-president-journalist","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-03T00:01:03Z","webTitle":"David Cameron protests to Chinese president after UK journalist barred","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/03/david-cameron-protests-chinese-president-journalist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/dec/03/david-cameron-protests-chinese-president-journalist","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron protests to Chinese president after UK journalist barred","bodyText":"David Cameron was forced on Monday to protest directly to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, after a British journalist was barred from attending a press conference in Beijing with the country's premier. In a sign of the challenge of trying to secure closer ties with Beijing, the prime minister was forced to interrupt discussions with Xi to express unease that the Bloomberg journalist Robert Hutton had been excluded from a press conference with Cameron and his Chinese counterpart, Li Keqiang. The prime minister raised the matter with Xi as he left a dinner with the president at the State Guest House in Beijing, after Downing Street had spoken out against the \"completely inappropriate\" decision to bar a journalist from such a high profile event. The decision by Beijing marred the first day of the prime minister's trip, which is meant to open a \"new page\" in Britain's relations with the EU. Downing Street will announce on Tuesday that a total of £5.6bn in deals will be signed during the prime minister's three-day visit to China. The most important agreement – a £4.5bn deal involving 100,000 Jaguar Land Rover cars – has been in the pipeline for some time. But the trade narrative was also diverted as the prime minister acknowledged that he would struggle to meet his pre-election target of lowering net migration to the \"tens of thousands\", as the latest figures demonstrated an increase in net migration – from 167,000 to 182,000. The prime minister insisted that he is taking tough action to deal with immigration. Cameron said in January 2010, a few months before the general election, that he aimed to bring net migration down to \"the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands\". However, the latest figures show an increase because fewer Britons are moving abroad. Asked whether he would fail to meet his target, the prime minister said: \"I don't accept that. If you take the whole three-year period, net immigration is down by around third.\" He said: \"The action we have taken takes some time to come through: getting rid of bogus colleges, trying to make sure that people who don't have a right to stay here leave, making sure that family reunion really is just that. A lot of these things take an amount of time to be dealt with.\" He added that he would \"keep going on this\". The ban on the Bloomberg journalist comes at a time when the financial news service is blocked in China, as a result of stories it ran on the wealth of families of senior leaders, including relatives of the president. Bloomberg last month denied killing a similarly sensitive story following a New York Times report that said editors had been concerned that its ability to report from China would be compromised if it ran the piece. Bloomberg said the piece was still in preparation. Hutton was told by an official on a bus ride from Beijing airport, after the prime minister's overnight flight from London, that the Chinese had decided his presence at the press conference a few hours later would not be appropriate. The official said: \"We have been told by the Chinese authorities that it would not be appropriate for you to attend.\" A Number 10 spokesman said: \"As soon as this issue became apparent on Sunday, we raised our concerns at senior levels and made clear it would be completely inappropriate to exclude journalists from the press statements. \"When we heard what had happened today we expressed our deep concern to senior Chinese officials about journalists being blocked.\" But Xi said he knew nothing about the subject when the prime minister raised the matter. Britain's decision to criticise the Chinese leadership in public on the highly sensitive issue in China of free speech showed that Number 10 is prepared to set boundaries as it opens what Cameron has described as the \"next page\" in Britain's relations with China. However, Beijing's refusal to act on British concerns over the press event, where questions were not even permitted, showed that China would also like to highlight some of its red lines in its new relationship with Britain. Cameron, who was criticised after his stepfather-in-law, Viscount Astor, was invited to join the business delegation, may face further criticism after Healthcare UK signed a memorandum of understanding with CITIC Trust and Circle Partnership, which has close links to the Conservatives. On the first full day of his visit the prime minister went out of his way to woo Beijing by quoting the father of modern China, Deng Xiaoping. The prime minister opened the day by quoting the famous saying of Deng Xiaoping, who broke with Maoism in the early 1980s to lay the ground for the modernisation of China by likening reform to \"crossing the river by feeling the stones\". Cameron said: \"The Chinese often talk about crossing the river by feeling your way across stones. It's time to dive together into the deep water and take this partnership the next level. Our destiny lies not in our stars but in ourselves.\" Meanwhile, Brussels dismissed as \"premature\" the prime minister's call for an EU-China free-trade agreement. It is his central proposal of the trip, designed to show how Britain will act as China's strongest advocate in the west, as Number 10 seeks to move on from a row after the prime minister met the Dalai Lama last year. \"We believe that it's premature to discuss a free-trade agreement with China,\" a spokesman for the EU, Alexandre Polack, was quoted by Bloomberg as telling reporters in Brussels. At the press conference, Li said China would like to be involved more deeply in Britain's first high-speed rail line north of London and have an increased role in civil nuclear power. As Cameron said the scale and pace of China's transformation dwarfed Britain's industrial revolution, Li said Beijing would like to invest in power projects. Speaking in the Great Hall of the People, Li said: \"The two sides have agreed to push for breakthroughs and progress in the cooperation between our enterprises on nuclear power and high speed rail. The Chinese side is willing to not only participate in but also purchase equities and stocks in UK power projects. Just like the high speed train, we need to grow this relationship at a higher speed.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/feb/11/trident-the-british-question","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-11T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"Trident: the British question | Ian Jack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/11/trident-the-british-question","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/feb/11/trident-the-british-question","fields":{"headline":"Trident: the British question","bodyText":"At this moment, a British submarine armed with nuclear missiles is somewhere at sea, ready to retaliate if the United Kingdom comes under nuclear assault from an enemy. The boat – which is how the Royal Navy likes to talk about submarines – is one of four in the Vanguard class: it might be Vengeance or Victorious or Vigilant but not Vanguard herself, which is presently docked in Devonport for a four-year-long refit. The Vanguards are defined as ballistic missile submarines or SSBNs, an initialism that means they are doubly nuclear. Powered by steam generated by nuclear reactors, they carry ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads. The location of the submarine – both as I write and you, the reader, read – is one of several unknowns. Somewhere in the North Atlantic or the Arctic would have been a reasonable guess when the Soviet Union was the enemy, but today nobody could be confident of naming even those large neighbourhoods. Another unknown is the number of missiles and warheads on board. Each submarine has the capacity to carry 16 missiles, each of them armed with as many as 12 independently targetable warheads; but those numbers started to shrink in the 1990s, and today’s upper limit is eight missiles and 40 warheads per submarine. Even so, those 40 warheads contain 266 times the destructive power of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. Vickers (now BAE Systems) built the submarine hulls at Barrow; Rolls-Royce made the reactors in Derby; the Atomic Weapons Establishment produces the warheads at Aldermaston and Burghfield in Berkshire. All these inputs are more or less British (less in the case of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, which is run by a consortium of two American companies and Serco), but the missile that they were built to serve and without which they would not exist is American: the Trident D5 or Trident II, also deployed by the US navy, comes out of the Lockheed Martin Space Systems factory in Sunnyvale, California. According to the Ministry of Defence, a British ballistic missile submarine has been patrolling the oceans prepared to do its worst at every minute of every day since 14 June 1969, when the responsibility for Britain’s strategic nuclear weapons passed from the Royal Air Force to the Royal Navy. Over the course of 46 years, many things have changed. Resolution-class submarines with Polaris missiles were replaced with Vanguards and Tridents nearly 20 years ago. The submarines are far bigger – a Vanguard submarine is twice as long as a jumbo jet – while the missiles have enormously increased their range and the warheads their precision. But the system, known as continuous-at-sea-deterrence or CASD, is essentially the same: four submarines work a rota which has one submarine on a three-month-long patrol, another undergoing refit or repair, a third on exercises, and a fourth preparing to relieve the first. The navy’s code name is Operation Relentless. This is an epic vigil, born in the cold war and not abandoned by its passing, and the government intends that it continues into a third generation of ballistic missile submarines – the provisionally-named Successor class – that will work to the same pattern as the Vanguards and carry a new version of the Trident D5, now under development. In the end, a military strategy devised to deter attack by the Soviet Union will have outlived its original enemy by at least half a century. Since the advent of the industrial revolution, few weapons systems have survived so long. The modern battleship, devised under the empty blue skies of Edwardian Britain, demonstrated its vulnerability to air attack even before Pearl Harbor; its useful career lasted hardly 40 years. Britain’s submarine-launched nuclear weapon, on the other hand, seems immune to obsolescence – as well as to financial, social and political hazards such as reductions in public spending, deindustrialisation, and the growing possibility of the break-up of the kingdom it was designed to protect. 2. ‘This project is a monster’ The Scottish Question is a familiar one. But Trident sits at the heart of a more complicated puzzle – what we might call the British Question – and embodies many of the crises and anxieties that have afflicted the United Kingdom since the second world war: the passing of empire, the “special relationship” with the United States, the decline of manufacturing and the disappearance of an industrial working class (and its consequences for the Labour party) – and, of course, the spectre of Scottish independence and the end of a United Kingdom. Trident and its ancestors have been among the causes and consequences of all of them. Where and how (if at all) its successors are deployed will be a measure of the kind of country, or countries, that Britain becomes. The Strategic Defence and Security Review that was presented to parliament last November described the building of the four Successor submarines as “a national endeavour … one of the largest government investment programmes, equivalent in scale to Crossrail or High Speed 2”. It will “require sustained long-term effort”, the report added, along with radical organisational and managerial changes to “create a world-class, enduring submarine enterprise”. The boosterism that inflects this language may reveal rather than disguise an underlying nervousness: the more a British government talks of “world-class” schemes and institutions, the faster we should count the spoons. Crossrail and HS2 are Britain’s most expensive public infrastructure projects (with the possible exception of the Hinkley Point nuclear power station, whose eventual cost to the public purse is hard to quantify). Recent estimates put the cost of Crossrail at £15.9bn and the first leg of HS2 – the 120 miles between London and Birmingham – at £30bn. The defence review increased the estimated manufacturing cost of the four Successor submarines to £31bn from an estimated £25bn that had held good from five years before, and for the first time added a contingency estimate of another £10bn. Delivery of the new fleet, already delayed from the early 2020s to 2028, is now scheduled to begin in the early 2030s, postponing the withdrawal of Vanguard submarines at least 10 years beyond their expected operational life. According to the defence review, the increased cost and delayed schedule “reflect the greater understanding we now have about the detailed design of the submarines and their manufacture”. Beyond this opaque statement, the Ministry of Defence will not explain why the cost should have risen by nearly a quarter during five years of near-to-zero inflation, for a programme that was authorised (by Tony Blair’s government) as long ago as December 2006 and which has already cost £3.9bn in its so‑called design phase. And this is only the beginning of mountainous public expense. Until last autumn, the generally accepted figure for the price of the entire Successor programme – and the one used by its critics, such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament – was £100bn. This is the cost of building and then arming, running and repairing four nuclear submarines over 40 years of operational life, followed by their upkeep as decommissioned hulks until the navy decides how to dispose of them. (A safe way of scrapping a nuclear submarine has still to be found; the 19 that the Royal Navy has so far withdrawn from service – the oldest of them in the 1980s – are all still laid up in navy dockyards at Rosyth and Devonport.) But in October, the Tory MP Crispin Blunt, a Trident sceptic, used information contained in a parliamentary reply from a junior defence minister, Philip Dunne, to estimate a far higher figure. Dunne had said that the in-service cost of the Successor programme would be about 6% of the annual defence budget over the project’s lifetime. Nobody, of course, can know what the UK’s defence budget will be in 20 years’ time; Blunt’s calculations presumed that it would not fall below 2% of GDP, which is the present government’s promise, and that GDP would grow at the rate expected by the government and the International Monetary Fund. On that basis, and on the assumption that in-service costs would run from 2028 to 2060, Blunt concluded that Successor would cost £167bn – a price, he said, that would consume double its predecessor’s proportion of the defence budget and was now “too high to be rational or sensible”. It may turn out to be lower. The new submarines may not last so long in service as the 32 years assumed by Blunt, and the principle of continuous-at-sea-deterrence could be modified – continuous only at times of international tension, for example – or even abolished by a future government. On the other hand, the cost could be higher. Dunne’s figure for the submarines’ building costs – £25bn – was raised by at least £6bn only a month later. Appearing in October before parliament’s public accounts committee, the senior civil servant at the Ministry of Defence, Jon Thompson, could only say that it was “extremely difficult” to estimate future costs – calling it “the project that most keeps me awake at night” and “a monster”. Stewart Hosie, the Scottish National party’s deputy leader at Westminster, said it was “truly an unthinkable and indefensible sum of money to spend on the renewal of an unwanted and unusable nuclear weapons system”. After independence itself, the SNP’s best-known political aim is the ejection of the UK’s nuclear-missile fleet from its base at Faslane on the Clyde. Over the next 15 years, a second referendum on the independence question in which Scotland votes to leave the United Kingdom is at least a strong possibility. The SNP, should it form the first independent Scottish government, would no doubt be pragmatic and opportunistic in its negotiations with London, but it seems unlikely that Faslane would continue as the home of another state’s nuclear deterrent. Its place in the SNP’s rhetoric has become far too prominent for that kind of compromise, even if London wants it. So far all the Ministry of Defence will say is that there are no plans to move the nuclear deterrent from the Clyde and that “any alternative solution would come at huge and unnecessary cost”. But unless the Trident renewal programme is something that the government secretly wants to cancel and would be happy to see sunk by Scottish independence, plans must exist to move the base out of Scotland. “Huge and unnecessary cost” – so far unspecified but certain to be several billion – is therefore what the UK-minus-Scotland will face. 3. The landscape of the cold war Faslane, officially Her Majesty’s Naval Base Clyde, is one of the most unexpected sights in modern Britain. The visitor imagines a small dockyard disfiguring a bare Scottish coast. What he finds instead is a long settlement that stretches for nearly two miles down the eastern shore of the Gareloch, the gentlest and most suburban of the Clyde’s seven larger sea lochs, an hour’s journey from Glasgow by commuter train and local bus. The best view of the base is from the loch’s western side, where a scattering of seaside villas, built in Victorian times for the Glasgow gentry, stand back from the little road that leads south down the Rosneath peninsula towards the open firth. A wood separates the road from the loch, but here and there a rough path leads down to a rocky beach glistening with damp seaweed. Scramble down one of these paths and you look across a mile of calm water to the kind of industrial scene that has vanished from most of Britain. Among the wharves, cranes, ships and sheds, a tall chimney marks the power plant that can generate enough electricity for a town of 25,000 people. Nearby, a ship lift capable of holding a 16,000-tonne submarine rises to the height of an 11-storey building. A cluster of accommodation blocks looks as trim and permanent as a fair-sized municipal housing estate. Faslane has a hospital, shops, naval mess rooms and civilian canteens. No other industrial site in Scotland has as many workers: Faslane employs about 6,500, while another 200 work over the hill on Loch Long at the armaments depot at Coulport, where the missiles are “mated” with their warheads. By day, the scene on the Gareloch is full of movement. Police launches and small grey warships come and go from the jetties, and sometimes, assisted by tugs, the heavy, dark shape of a submarine moves into mid-channel and slides towards the Firth of Clyde. By night, from the straight hill road that was built to take the lorries loaded with nuclear warheads on the last leg of their journey from Berkshire to Coulport, the base spreads out below like a brightly lit seaside resort with a pier and a promenade. Security is dramatically visible: double razor-wire fences, sentry posts, watch towers. Sometimes, driving slowly to take in the view, you form the impression that the car behind is also taking an interest – when you stop, it stops – too artfully, you think, but then you were raised on the paranoid fictions of the cold war. Faslane belongs to that time, and more particularly to one of its most influential theories: that the immensely destructive power of nuclear weapons had changed the purpose of military strategy from winning conflicts to deterring them. An adversary would be dissuaded from attacking because the lives and property lost in a counter-attack would be too heavy a price to bear. No matter the difference in military strength between the powers – for example, between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom – the same calculation would still apply. It wouldn’t quite be tit for tat. The Soviets could easily wipe out the UK completely and capture what remained of its resources, while UK retaliation might amount only to the ruination of Moscow. But for the Soviet Union, that might be dissuasive enough. The weakness in the theory was the surprise attack, in which the aggressor state struck at military installations to eliminate its victim’s capacity to hit back. How was that capacity to be kept intact? Defensive missile shields offered only limited protection to pre-emptive attacks on the static (and hardly secret) locations of land-based nuclear weapons: airfields for the aircraft that would drop free-fall bombs and the silos that sheltered intercontinental ballistic missiles. Submarine-based weapons, on the other hand, had the twin advantages of mobility and near-invisibility. A new method of propulsion, in which a nuclear reactor made the steam that drove the turbines, was a sealed system that, unlike the diesel engine, neither needed air nor emitted waste; human endurance was now the main limitation to the length of a submarine’s voyage. A nuclear submarine could travel as fast as any large surface ship and at lower speeds much more quietly, and therefore less detectably, than its diesel-driven predecessor. The increasing range of missiles meant that by the early 1960s they could be fired well out to sea and hit a target a thousand miles inland. Their submarine launch platform had a whole ocean to hide in. The US navy commissioned the world’s first nuclear submarine, the Nautilus, in 1955. On his visit to Britain the next year, the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev told an audience at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, that a future war would not be “decided by cruisers, not even by bombers. They too are outdated … Today the submarine fleet has come to the forefront as the chief naval weapon, and the chief aerial weapon is the missile, which can hit targets at great distances, and in future the distance will be unlimited.” By 1957, this had become equally clear to the Royal Navy. In the words of an Admiralty paper published that year, if Britain didn’t acquire nuclear submarines it would “cease to count as a naval force in world affairs”. The first of them, HMS Dreadnought, put to sea in 1962, but only after considerable technical assistance from the US navy and the American engineering company Westinghouse. It marked the beginning of a dependence on American technology that has grown with every generation of British missile submarines since. 4. Losing an empire I saw Faslane for the first time in the early summer of 1958, from a steam train puffing slowly into the western Highlands. I remember a bay scattered with small craft at anchor and a glimpse of one of Britain’s last battleships, which was being dismantled at the breaker’s yard that in those days occupied the bay. Later research shows that the battleship must have been HMS Anson – named after Admiral George Anson, who defeated the French at the first battle of Cape Finisterre in 1747. At the time I recognised her only as a member of the King George V class: ten 14-inch guns in three turrets, two funnels, 27 knots at full speed. I knew this because I lived next door to a royal dockyard, Rosyth, and ships had become an enthusiasm. I liked their taxonomy – destroyers, frigates, minelayers, corvettes – and easily absorbed the details of their fighting power from books with titles like The Boys’ Book of the Navy. There was, of course, something else – some ineffable boyhood veneration of the ship itself and with it the kind of patriotism – unexamined, omnipresent – that came from watching films about the war at sea. I argued with an American boy at my primary school. Who had the bigger navy? I contested, insupportably by then, that it was ours. The 1950s were what the journalist Nigel Fountain once described as Britain’s “Icarus period”. It still imagined itself as the world’s third great power, equipped industrially to pioneer exciting and, as it turned out, risky technologies such as jet airliners and nuclear power stations. British innovation allowed a different kind of patriotism – scientific achievement rather than imperial dominion – but many of its pet projects fell to earth (the world’s first jet airliner, the Comet, did so literally and too often), while others failed to take off. This was the case with the Blue Streak medium-range ballistic missile, which the government intended as the successor to an RAF bomber fleet that improved Soviet air defences were making obsolete. For a time, the Blue Streak symbolised Britain’s bright future (I remember Blue Streak racing bikes for boys and Blue Streak bubble gum), but it was eventually cancelled on the grounds that land-based missiles were vulnerable to a pre-emptive strike. Britain then turned to an air-launched ballistic missile, the Skybolt, which America was close to putting into production, but in 1962 that too was cancelled after a series of test failures. This was a grave blow to British plans – an agreement reached between President Eisenhower and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan had made the deal for the Skybolt look a certainty. If Britain was to persist with an effective nuclear deterrent, it needed to persuade the US to let it have the only available alternative: the powerful submarine-launched missile, Polaris. Britain had some leverage here: in 1961 the US navy had established a forward base for its Polaris fleet at the Holy Loch, which lies only seven or eight miles across the Clyde from the Gareloch. During the negotiations over the site, the British side raised the idea that one day Britain might obtain Polaris missiles for itself. The Americans resisted the idea; they distrusted British behaviour after the Suez invasion five years earlier and, more broadly, believed that the fewer countries that possessed their formidable new weapon the better. Enmities developed. There were rumours that Washington wanted to push the UK out of the nuclear business. It was in this context – and only a fortnight before Macmillan met the US president, John Kennedy, at a specially convened summit in Nassau in December, 1962 – that Kennedy’s foreign policy adviser, Dean Acheson, delivered a speech at the West Point military academy. “Great Britain has lost an empire and has not yet found a role,” he said in the speech’s most celebrated passage. “The attempt to play a separate power role … apart from Europe, a role based on a ‘special relationship’ with the United States, a role based on being head of a ‘commonwealth’ which has no political structure, or unity, or strength – this role is about played out.” The speech infuriated Macmillan – Acheson, he said, had made the same mistake as “quite a lot of people in the last 400 years, including … Napoleon, the Kaiser and Hitler” – and the discussions with Kennedy in the Bahamas became, in his words, “protracted and fiercely contested”. America insisted that it would sell Polaris to Britain only if control of the missile was assigned to Nato, but that wasn’t Macmillan’s idea of an independent deterrent. Finally, the two sides brokered a compromise that gave control to Nato but reserved Britain’s right to act independently – that is, to fire the missile without consulting anyone else, including the US – in situations where “Her Majesty’s Government may decide that supreme national interests are at stake”. With these dozen words, Britain could claim that its new deterrent would be free from foreign veto over its use. The warheads and the submarines would be made in Britain. Polaris was certainly an American missile, made by Lockheed (now Lockheed Martin) in California, but it would be just as obedient to British command as the British-built bombers it replaced. The Nassau agreement laid down the fundamentals of the military policy that the UK has followed ever since, but as Peter Hennessy and James Jinks write in their fine history of the Royal Navy’s submarine service, The Silent Deep, the agreement’s attempt “to reconcile interdependence with independence remained a source of continuing difficulties … as the two countries disagreed over what exactly had been agreed”. Kennedy’s under-secretary of state, George Ball, described it later as “intolerably vague” and a “monument of contrived ambiguity”. Nobody could say for sure what fell into the category of “supreme national interests”; most people, including Kennedy, found it hard to imagine Britain launching an atomic warhead without American assent. Solly Zuckerman, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, decided that the question “How independent?” was as pointless as medieval disputation. If Polaris missiles ever came to be fired, the British public “would never even know” whether they had reached their target. “There would be no newspapers to tell us, no television … and maybe no ‘us’, just the crews of those Polaris boats that had been at sea.” 5. How Trident reached Faslane We are often traitors to our earlier selves. In 1958, I was the kind of boy who loved warships; in 1961, I was another kind of boy who opposed them. The US navy established its Polaris base in the Holy Loch that year (it stayed until 1992) in the face of fierce opposition from the anti-nuclear movement, which was reaching its first peak. Ongoing atmospheric testing, the effects of radiation on Japanese fishermen, the better-dead-than-red rhetoric of politicians, the obvious futility of civil defence: all contributed to the general foreboding and, among a minority, the need to protest. Civil disobedience and non-violent resistance, then novel techniques to Britain, gave the demonstrations unprecedented publicity. The Holy Loch protest that I joined on a September afternoon in 1961 had its farcical dimension; a gale prevented our ferry from landing its cargo of several hundred protesters, sending us back across the Clyde to march miles away from the base. Nevertheless, more than 350 people did manage to get arrested at a sit-in at the base’s gates, where American sailors making their entrances and exits were taunted and teased with chants of “Yankees go home!” and “Ye canny spend a dollar when ye’re deid” (to the tune of “She’ll be coming ’round the mountain”). The anti-nuclear cause in Scotland had a distinct and memorable flavour, less solemn than the protests in the south – the songs had a Glasgow swagger and wit – but also more xenophobic, because the nuclear weapons being protested against weren’t even our own. There was another difference, which in terms of Scottish political attitudes may be the Holy Loch’s most important legacy: one of the most beautiful seascapes in Europe – of longstanding aesthetic and recreational value to industrial Scotland – had been chosen by the United States as the site for a nuclear base with the connivance of a British government. It was hard to resist the conclusion that the British government worried more about preserving the safety and landscape of southern England than it did about those things in western Scotland. The SNP at the time was insignificant as a political influence, but its opposition to Polaris at its 1961 conference, extended to all nuclear weapons two years later, began to rouse a slumbering grievance. In fact, it was Washington’s brute power rather than London’s duplicity that decided the location. According to the military analysts Malcolm Chalmers and William Walker (writing in their 2001 book, Uncharted Waters), the Americans wanted a sheltered anchorage with access to deep water that was situated “near a transatlantic airfield and a centre of population in which the American service personnel could be absorbed”. The Holy Loch was an obvious choice; it was close to Prestwick airport and the bright lights of Glasgow, sheltered from the prevailing south-westerlies, and stood a better chance than a more open location of confining a nuclear spillage, should one occur. A deal between the Admiralty and the US navy was close to being agreed when Harold Macmillan intervened and asked the two sides to think again. He was alarmed at the prospect of nuclear weapons being based 30 miles from Glasgow and its “large number of agitators”; in a letter to Eisenhower, Macmillan noted that its status as a Soviet target “would give rise to the greatest political difficulties and would make the project almost unsaleable in this country”. The Admiralty looked again at the possibilities and this time included Falmouth in Cornwall, Milford Haven in west Wales, and Fort William in the western Highlands, the last favoured by the Macmillan’s cabinet because of its distance from large populations. But the US navy was adamant in its choice and the political difficulties foreseen by Macmillan duly arrived, in terms of the Holy Loch protests. But these didn’t last long – the end of atmospheric testing and the peaceful resolution of the Cuban missile crisis had drawn the sting from the nuclear disarmament campaign. As a result, the question of where Britain’s own Polaris submarines were to be based aroused remarkably little attention when the government began its deliberations in 1963. Many of the criteria were the same as the Americans had applied earlier. The Admiralty wanted a base near deep water that had easy access to a labour force and could be easily supplied by road and rail – and in addition, for safety reasons, a missile storage and loading site that was separated by at least 4,400ft from the regular docking berth, where routine maintenance was carried out and crews came and went. These requirements ruled out all islands, the remote north-west of Scotland, and the south and east coasts all the way from Dorset to Berwickshire, just below the Firth of Forth. Of the eventual longlist of 10, Milford Haven was judged too close to an oil refinery; Invergordon and Loch Alsh were too remote and too vulnerable to submarine attack; Devonport had the city of Plymouth on its doorstep. Falmouth was perfect in every way, but the land there owned by the Duchy of Cornwall and the National Trust was held to be too expensive and difficult to buy, and the government working party felt that “a strong case would be required to justify spoiling a national beauty spot or vigorous sailing centre”. That left two Scottish sites. The Treasury and the ministries of defence and transport favoured Rosyth in the Firth of Forth, mainly because it was cheaper: it had a spacious dockyard with a separate munitions jetty already in place. (The fact that Edinburgh’s 450,000 people lived only 10 miles away apparently played no part in the argument for or against.) For operational reasons, the Admiralty much preferred Faslane: its site in the Gareloch offered better shelter and protection than Rosyth, and the Clyde’s geography gave a submerged submarine a choice of deep-water routes towards the Atlantic. The firth was also particularly well equipped as a submarine testing ground. Its long sea lochs held deep, calm water, notably free of inconvenient shoals and rocks, which the Royal Navy had used from the start of the 20th century as the test-bed for the products of its Greenock torpedo factory. During the second world war, when the Clyde became a primary destination for transatlantic shipments of troops and supplies, Faslane Bay had acquired a substantial harbour, a railway connection and a title: Military Port Number One. Postwar, half of it was given over to shipbreaking and the other half to a flotilla of pre-nuclear submarines. These convenient legacies of older wars clinched the navy’s case for Faslane as the base for Polaris. By 1968, work had finished on new docking facilities in the Gareloch and the loading jetty and missile bunkers at Coulport, and the Admiralty could congratulate itself on one of the largest building projects it had ever undertaken. Much bigger things were to come. Twelve years later, when the governments of Britain and the United States agreed to replace the Polaris system with the Trident D5, an extravagant programme of works made Faslane into the largest building project in Europe – one never equalled before or since in the history of the Ministry of Defence. The ship lift, the power station, the new road to carry warheads that was bulldozed nine miles down the glen: by 1994, thanks partly to the more stringent safety standards that followed the Chernobyl disaster, the reshaping of Faslane had cost £1.9bn (£3.5bn at today’s prices) and was 72% over budget. The ship lift can withstand earthquakes up to 8 on the Richter scale. I’ve travelled around this part of Argyllshire often enough, and seen it, too, from boats and steamers on the Clyde. There is melancholy here. The industrial prosperity that created its marine villas and yacht slipways began to ebb away after the first world war; by 1952, the writer George Blake could describe the settlements around the Gareloch and Loch Long as “slightly pathetic backwaters” – which in the case of Coulport’s long range of seaside houses “wore the look of something that had not quite come off and had been written off”. In 2005, when the Ministry of Defence demolished the last of these Victorian houses, the original Coulport vanished. Other and grander dwellings went long before: Rosneath Castle, home to Queen Victoria’s daughter Louise, the Duchess of Argyll; Shandon House, built for the innovative shipbuilder and cofounder of the Cunard Line, Robert Napier. Country retreats had been buried under an armed advance. One bright afternoon last autumn as I drove along the miles of boundary fence, it struck me that this might be the last great military landscape that the United Kingdom would create, the last chapter in a history that includes the Grand Fleet’s anchorage at Scapa Flow, the artillery ranges of the Salisbury Plain and the bomber airfields of Lincolnshire. Would there ever be the money again? Or the will or the need? Once all these things had seemed like scars on the land: the new straight roads, the roundabouts, the street lights, the watchtowers, the ship lift, the anonymous sheds that held God knows what. Now it was interesting to see them as potential ruins, something an empire left behind in the hills as it abandoned the frontier and shrank back to the capital. 6. Everybody’s headache On 3 September 1986, Margaret Thatcher laid the keel of the first Trident submarine, HMS Vanguard, at Vickers’ shipyard in Barrow. Earlier that year, the most eloquent case for its cancellation had been made by the first episode of Yes, Prime Minister, the BBC comedy series written by Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn in which a fictional prime minister, Jim Hacker, is in perpetual battle with his most senior civil servant, Sir Humphrey Appleby. “I’ve decided to cancel Trident,” Hacker tells an astonished Sir Humphrey. He intends to divert some of the savings into conventional forces and reintroduce conscription, and “at one stroke” solve Britain’s balance of payments, educational and unemployment problems. Sir Humphrey [scandalised] : With Trident we could obliterate the whole of eastern Europe. Hacker: I don’t want to obliterate the whole of eastern Europe. Sir Humphrey: But it’s a deterrent. Hacker: It’s a bluff. I probably wouldn’t use it. Sir Humphrey: Yes, but they don’t know that you probably wouldn’t. Hacker: They probably do. Sir Humphrey: Yes, they probably know that you probably wouldn’t. But they can’t certainly know. Hacker: They probably certainly know that I probably wouldn’t. Sir Humphrey: Yes, but even though they probably certainly know that you probably wouldn’t, they don’t certainly know that, although you probably wouldn’t, there is no probability that you certainly would. Hacker: What? This wizard-behind-the-curtain aspect of Trident is the official reason for having it. What matters is belief. The navy could fill the sharp end of a Trident missile with straw, but if the straw could be kept a perfect secret and the world went on believing that instead of straw there were warheads capable of destroying 266 cities, each the size of Hiroshima, then Trident would be doing its job. If it had to be used, then the world, or what was left of it, would of course discover the truth. But if it had to be used, it wouldn’t have worked (and there would be few of us left to care). When Jeremy Corbyn said in September that he was opposed to the use of nuclear weapons – though his refusal to “press the button” was never stated in so many words – General Sir Nicholas Houghton, chief of the defence staff, responded by saying that a prime minister who announced he would never fire nuclear weapons “completely undermined” the deterrent. In theory, this is true. Provided the enemy was credulous as well as rash, this disavowal of nuclear retaliation might make an adversary more ready to attack. (A more cautious enemy might decide that all such a prime minister’s statement probably meant was that he probably wouldn’t.) But Houghton’s argument that the UK uses the deterrent “every second of every minute of every day” invites greater scepticism. Just exactly what has been deterred? And why have non-nuclear weapons states such as Germany, Spain and Japan been just as successful in deterring it? Even before it possessed them, Britain’s need for nuclear weapons was contentious. “We’ve got to have this thing [the atom bomb] over here whatever it costs [and] we’ve got to have the bloody Union Jack on top of it,” were the words of the Labour foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin, in 1946 after he returned from an unsuccessful attempt to persuade Washington to share its nuclear expertise. Not everyone in government was convinced. The small cabinet committee that met a few months later to sanction Britain’s nuclear programme was careful to exclude ministers such as the chancellor of the exchequer who might object on grounds of cost, and the military also had doubts. A memo from Sir Henry Tizard, the chief scientific adviser to the ministry of defence, suggested that Britain’s pursuit of the bomb made the country blind to reality. “We persist in regarding ourselves as a great power capable of everything and only temporarily handicapped by economic difficulties. We are not a great power, and never will be again,” Tizard wrote in 1949, adding: “We are a great nation, but if we continue to behave like a great power we shall soon cease to be a great nation.” The question has divided Britain, and particularly the Labour party, more than any other other nuclear weapons state. In France, which has a similar nuclear strategy, the left was happy to applaud the force de dissuasion, but Labour’s Christian and anti-war traditions made it more difficult for the leadership to celebrate military power, at least openly. On the other hand, it needed to be seen as patriotic. In the words of Professor Michael Clarke, formerly of the Royal United Services Institute, support for nuclear weapons came to stand “for the defence of the realm in general”. What Clarke calls “the prevailing party folklore” – that embracing unilateral nuclear disarmament had cost Labour the 1983 election – turned it into a party that, at least until Corbyn became its leader, had to be more loyal than the king. In their history of the Royal Navy’s submarine service, Peter Hennessy and James Jinks describe this troubled history as “Labour’s nuclear neuralgia”. What its leaders wanted was often difficult to know. The manifesto for the 1964 election said that the Nassau agreement to buy Polaris nuclear missiles from the US would “add nothing to the deterrent strength of the Western Alliance … [Polaris] will not be independent and it will not be British and it will not deter … We are not prepared any longer to waste the country’s resources on endless duplication of strategic nuclear weapons.” Nothing could be plainer. The military establishment, including the then chief of defence staff, Lord Mountbatten, firmly believed that Polaris would be cancelled if Labour won; the government encouraged the Admiralty to spend as much as possible on the submarine programme to make cancellation more difficult. But Labour’s victory, when it came, changed very little apart from shrinking the intended Polaris fleet from five submarines to four. Harold Wilson, the new prime minister, was told that the construction of the first two submarines “had passed the point of no return” and seemed anxious to believe it. As he later admitted, the deterrent “had an emotional appeal to the man in the pub”, omitting to say that this might not be the case for the man in the party. When the first of the Polaris submarines, HMS Resolution, was commissioned into the navy in 1967, no representative of Wilson’s government attended the ceremony. In his memoirs, the chief executive of the Polaris programme, vice-admiral Sir Hugh Mackenzie, recalled that while Labour ministers were happy to give “their support wholeheartedly, and even enthusiastically” to Polaris in private, in public they “remained sensitive to anything to do with it … and were reluctant to encourage much in the way of publicity for what it was achieving.” In its manifesto for the 1974 election, Labour promised that when Polaris expired in the early 1990s it would not be replaced with a new generation of nuclear weapons – a policy similar to the non-renewal of Trident that Jeremy Corbyn now wants Labour to adopt. The party’s next election manifesto, in 1979, was more cautious, stressing that “a full and informed debate” was needed before a Labour government made such radical commitment, but even so it still believed that non-renewal was “the best course for Britain”. This impression of open-mindedness was misleading. Since 1977, a small group of Labour ministers and government officials, known as the Restricted Group, had been meeting secretly to discuss how the nuclear deterrent might be continued when Polaris reached the end of its life in the 1990s. Two senior civil servants, Sir Anthony Duff and Sir Ronald Mason, were commissioned to write a study: the result is a key document in British military history, the Duff-Mason report, which in its three parts laid out the pros and cons of renewing an independent nuclear deterrent, the criteria such a deterrent would need to meet to be effective, and the weapons systems that might deliver it. What level of damage would the Soviet Union consider to be unacceptable? The report suggested that it might be reached by “the disruption of the main government organs of the Soviet State [in Moscow] or by causing grave damage to a number of major cities involving destruction of buildings, heavy loss of life, general disruption and serious consequences for industrial and other assets.” Moscow’s anti-ballistic missile defences and underground bunkers narrowed the chances of a successful attack; the other options included “breakdown level damage to Leningrad and about nine other major cities” and “grave damage, not necessarily to breakdown level, to 30 major targets, including Leningrad and other large cities”. Ministers and officials in the Restricted Group read the Duff-Mason report in December 1978 and made various suggestions about how cheaply “unacceptable damage” in any of its forms might be delivered. David Owen, the foreign secretary, wanted to adapt ordinary attack submarines (known as SSNs) so that they could launch shorter-range cruise missiles carrying nuclear warheads. Someone else proposed collaborating with France, which by now had its own fleet of ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). Michael Quinlan, a deputy under-secretary of state at the Ministry of Defence, thought that a casualty figure of up to 10 million Soviet dead might not be enough to deter a country that had lost more than 20 million people in the second world war. “In this field nothing is provable,” Quinlan wrote, “but it is far from clear that they would regard less than half of 1% of their population as an unthinkable price for contemplating a conquest of western Europe.” Of the options available, James Callaghan, Wilson’s successor as prime minister, echoed the recommendation implied in the Duff-Mason report and favoured the Trident missile system that was then being developed for the US navy. The next month – January 1979 – he flew to a summit meeting between the UK, the US, France and Germany held in Guadeloupe, where he intended to have a private session with the US president, Jimmy Carter. It was on his return from this summit that his nonchalant response to a reporter’s question about Britain’s social turmoil that winter became the headline, “Crisis? What crisis?” – famous words that were never in fact spoken by Callaghan but helped lose him the general election. What he returned with might be said to be far more consequential – an assurance from Carter that the UK could have Trident if it wanted it; information that, together with the Duff-Mason report, he passed to the incoming government of Margaret Thatcher, who immediately became embroiled in the arguments over its cost. Nuclear neuralgia has never been confined to the Labour party. The need to have as cheap a deterrent as possible has been the source of conflict within governments since the early 1960s, asserting itself most obviously with the question: how many submarines do we really need? First raised with the Polaris, this question returned with Trident and returned again with Trident renewal, and each time, after pressure from the Ministry of Defence, the eventual answer has been a quartet. In 1980 as in 1964, the Royal Navy wanted five, though some members of Thatcher’s government wanted none at all. John Nott, the defence minister charged with pressing Trident’s case, reported to Thatcher in February 1981 that two-thirds of the Conservative party and two-thirds of the cabinet opposed the purchase of Trident and that even the chiefs of the defence staff were not unanimous. Nonetheless, three submarines were sanctioned in January 1982, with a fourth added only a few months later. The building programme had financial repercussions that went far beyond the cost of the vessels themselves and their remodelled base at Faslane. At Barrow, the Devonshire Dock Hall, the largest indoor shipyard in Europe, was built specifically to handle their construction. At Aldermaston, new facilities were needed to produce the Trident warheads. Even so, Nott could boast in 1982 that Trident’s cost over 15 years would be about 3% of the UK’s annual defence budget – compared to the 20% of annual defence spending that an independent deterrent was costing the French. Whereas the Polaris missiles had to be removed from submarines for routine maintenance and a change of warhead, the design of the Tridents made that unnecessary: repairs could be done, and the warheads changed, without offloading the missiles. That made a lot of Coulport’s work redundant. On the far fewer occasions that a missile had to leave or join the ship, the US Navy proposed that the operation could be carried out at its base in the state of Georgia – reducing Trident’s costs, at the cost of compromising the idea of its independence. A meeting to consider the proposed new arrangements decided, in the words of Thatcher’s summing-up, that “the political and financial advantages of carrying out missile processing in the United States outweighed the marginal reduction in the independence of the Trident system and the eventual loss of job opportunities in Scotland”. The unspoken reality, then and since, is that the US could eventually disable Britain’s nuclear deterrent if it chose to by cutting off technical help and equipment – it might take months, but the outcome would be certain. That hardly mattered in a strategy where perception was everything and Britain and the US had a common enemy. According to the record of the decisive meeting, Thatcher had been persuaded to up the number of submarines from three to four because three would not be a credible deterrent “so far as the perception of the Soviet Union was concerned”. Nobody conceived any other adversary. The Duff-Mason report had been quite explicit: “Over the next 30-40 years, our planning need not be geared to any nuclear threat beyond the Soviet Union.” And yet on 26 December 1991, little more than 13 years after that sentence was written, the Soviet Union voted itself out of existence. In 1994, the British government announced that Moscow, Leningrad (St Petersburg) and other sites in the former Soviet Union had been dropped as targets, and that Trident’s guidance computers no longer routinely held targeting information – implying that the coordinates of new targets would be programmed if and when they were identified. When the first of the Trident fleet, HMS Vanguard, put to sea, the Soviet Union had been dead two years. By the time the fourth submarine, HMS Vengeance, began its operational life in November 1999, it had been gone for the best part of a decade. The four most expensive ships ever built for the Royal Navy had arrived too late for the party. 7. Not just another country One morning last October, I had coffee with Feargal Dalton, a former lieutenant commander of a Trident-missile submarine. We met by arrangement in the house of a friend who lives a mile or two down the coast from the warhead jetty at Coulport. From this house, a bungalow set high on a hill, you look down on the great broad junction of the Clyde, where sea lochs join the estuary from the north and west, and the estuary takes a 90-degree turn towards the south and the Atlantic. It was a still morning of mist and sun. The sea was silvery, and creased only by the wakes of small warships on a naval exercise. This was familiar territory to Dalton, who spent 15 of his 17 years in the Royal Navy in submarines, eventually as a weapons engineering officer, a WEO, in charge of the missiles. In fact, he is one of the few Royal Navy officers – he believed there were “only nine or 10 of us” – to have pulled the trigger and sent a Trident D5 bursting out of its undersea compartment and roaring into the air towards its target on the US’s test range off the coast of Florida. The missiles cost about $37m (£26m) each, so firings are rare. Dalton got his chance in May 2009 when his submarine, HMS Victorious, underwent what is known as a Daso, a Demonstration and Shakedown Operation, after a substantial refit. These firings are usually publicised. As Hennessy and Jinks write: “Central to remaining a nuclear-weapons nation is the need at regular intervals to show the rest of the world that is exactly what the UK still is.” But Dalton’s event was completely ignored by the media. “Check it,” he said. “It just didn’t happen. Gordon Brown didn’t want the media to notice because a non-proliferation meeting was being held around the same time.” He seemed irritated by this – in his view, it was typical of Labour’s muddled and hypocritical attitude towards nuclear weapons. You had to stand up and be counted for or against them, and now he was against them, having left the navy in 2010 to become a teacher and an SNP councillor in Glasgow. (His wife, Carol Monaghan, is one of the city’s new SNP MPs.) Everything about Dalton is unlikely. His family’s political history is in the militant Irish Republicanism of South Armagh; nonetheless, he said it was the IRA atrocities at Enniskillen and Warrington that persuaded him to join the Royal Navy after he graduated with an electronics degree from University College Dublin. He wore a few badges in his lapel: an enamel Armistice poppy, a veteran’s pin, the insignia of the submarine base HMS Neptune. He said several times that it was to the Royal Navy’s “immense credit” that it had accepted and promoted him despite his background. He loved the Royal Navy and at the same time wanted Scotland to kick it out. He hated nuclear weapons and at the same insisted that he would have fired one for real if he had been ordered to. We drank our coffee. Dalton said that submarine crews were just as sceptical about the independent nuclear deterrent as he was; many of them believed its purpose was political rather than military. “I knew for 15 years that Trident was about keeping Britain as a permanent member of the UN security council and most of the men I served with knew it too,” he said. “We had an acute sense of, ‘If we mess this up, the UK will lose its place at the big boys’ table.’” The UK was “still concerned with projecting global power”, he added, whereas an independent Scotland would be concerned with “projecting global justice and peace”. The crew of a submarine probably have a deeper knowledge of each other than any other workplace can provide, though of course Dalton has a political axe to grind and may not be the most reliable witness to their conversations. But who could argue with the idea that “status and influence” is the most persuasive answer to the question of what Trident is for? There are other answers: to provide jobs and preserve skills; to sustain what’s left in Britain of high-tech shipbuilding and nuclear technology; to make the nation feel more secure in an increasingly dangerous world, where the number of countries with nuclear weapons looks certain to grow. But even in the cold war, the case for nuclear weapons went beyond the military. “To give up our status as a nuclear weapons state would be a momentous step in British history,” is the last (and by implication, not least) of the pro-Trident arguments in the Duff-Mason report. “It gives us access to and the possibility of influencing American thinking on defence and arms control policy and has enabled us to play a leading role in international arms control and non‑proliferation negotiations.” Thatcher’s defence minister, John Nott, made a similar point about status and influence a few years later. Not to proceed with Trident when it was “probably inevitable” that other small countries would acquire a nuclear capability meant, he wrote, that “in the eyes of our allies, and of our enemies, we would seem quite a different nation (and the Conservative party quite a different party)”. A different nation, one whose political and military influence was commensurate with its economic size – there were few takers for that. “Britain is not just another country. It has never been just another country,” Mrs Thatcher told her interviewer Sir Robin Day during the 1987 election, when she faced a Labour party whose commitment to unilateralism was weakening but not yet expunged. “We would not have grown into an empire if we were just another European country,” she continued. “It was Britain that stood when everyone else surrendered and if Britain pulls out of that [nuclear] commitment, it is as if one of the pillars of the temple has collapsed.” Tony Blair reached a similar view in 2006 after he and his chancellor, Gordon Brown, had debated the pros and cons of Trident renewal. Blair writes in his memoirs that it wasn’t an argument between “tough” and “pacifist” attitudes to defence: “On simple pragmatic grounds, there was a case either way.” But in the end he decided that “giving it up [was] too big a downgrading of our status as a nation, and in an uncertain world, too big a risk for our defence … but the contrary decision would not have been stupid.” Brown was similarly torn. Blair remembers telling him: “Imagine standing up in the House of Commons and saying I’ve decided to scrap it. We’re not going to say that, are we?” The cabinet agreed to renew Trident without any dissent, and on 14 March 2007 the House of Commons voted by 409 to 161 (the minority included 88 Labour MPs) to build the new Successor class submarines that, together with modifications to the D5 missile, would prolong the system’s life from 2020 to 2050. Soon after Blair’s victory in 1997, a profile in the New Yorker mistakenly identified him as “Britain’s first post-imperial prime minister”. Nearly 20 years later, we still have not seen such a thing – at least not in Westminster. But Scotland is different. Many people inside Scotland, including its government, imagine their future as a country like Denmark: small, northern and prosperous, and committed to free education and welfarism. Not the least attraction of Scottish nationalism is that independence offers Scotland the chance to be what Thatcher called an ordinary country, freed from a burdensome British past – conquest, war, glory – of which Trident may be the last potent symbol. Brendan O’Hara is the Westminster MP for Argyll, elected in last year’s SNP landslide. Faslane is inside his constituency and the preservation of jobs there is in an important local issue: when we met in London, O’Hara described the base as the future headquarters of Scotland’s armed forces as well as a naval base for the frigates and patrol boats that would comprise the Scottish fleet. But in his view, Trident can’t be justified on moral, economic or military grounds. “The world is changing – terrorism, the mass movement of people into mega cities, the conflicts over scarce resources, the migrations brought about by climate change … and yet the UK is hell-bent on going down the same 1960s route,” he said, echoing his party colleague Dalton. “Does anyone really think that nuclear weapons make the UK a safer place? For the establishment down here [London], Trident is a political weapon – it’s about preserving your status as a nation.” In this way, the Trident argument has thrown up competing visions of a national future. After I left O’Hara’s office, I walked up Whitehall, past the Cenotaph and the statues of famous generals. Tourists gathered around the sentries from the Household Cavalry with their scarlet tunics and shining helmets. The grand offices built for an imperial bureaucracy rose tall on either side. Big Ben rang the half-hour. Big red buses obscured the base of Nelson’s Column. England has this history to consider – a weighty and complicated inheritance that includes the Anglo-American relationship, Harold Wilson’s patriot in the pub and a popular media that never wants to let the idea of greatness go. It can’t easily cut this history loose, nor does it seem to want to. Wherever its road leads, it isn’t, or at any rate just yet, Tridentless towards Scandinavia. 8. Transparent oceans Consider a series of possibilities that verge on the probable: 1) Scotland has a second referendum in the next 15 years; 2) it votes for independence; 3) negotiations to remove Trident begin; 4) Edinburgh and London reach a settlement, several years before the first of the new Successor submarines is scheduled to begin service in 2032 or 2033. Until recently, many people – including me – thought these four events would trigger a fifth: that London, facing the costs of relocating the Trident base would decide to abandon its nuclear strategy or at least this submarine form of it. The submarines under construction could be converted, scrapped or sold. Billions of pounds would have been spent, but future billions would be saved. John Ainslie, the knowledgeable leader of Scottish CND, wrote in 2014 that he believed this to be “the most likely outcome” of Scottish independence – and the statements of politicians and military officers, apparently appalled by the cost, suggested he was right. In 2012, Nick Harvey, the armed forces minister in the coalition government, told the Scottish affairs committee that relocating the base outside Scotland would be “a very challenging project, which would take a very long time to complete and would cost a gargantuan sum of money”. A former Faslane commander, Rear Admiral Martin Alabaster, said that it would be very difficult – “in fact, I would almost use the word inconceivable” – to recreate the facilities elsewhere in the UK. The committee concluded that relocation would be “highly problematic, very expensive, and fraught with political difficulties”. An MoD source told the Guardian that the costs were “eye-wateringly high”. There were strategic questions, too. Addressing the Royal United Services Institute in December 2013, General Sir Nicholas Houghton argued that defence spending should be refocused on the threats posed by terrorism, cyber warfare and climate change. His reference to the danger of stretching “insufficient resources” to buy “exquisite equipment” did not mention Trident, but the renewal programme stood out as the most obvious target of his criticism. What was missing in these arguments, however, was the effect of Scottish independence on the government of the rest of the UK (rUK). Professor Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute has spent a good part of a lifetime studying Britain’s nuclear strategy. When I asked him if he thought independence was the beginning of the end for Trident renewal, he shot back: “Would the rest of the UK be prepared to give up its nuclear force when its reputation had already been damaged by the break-up of the union? I don’t quite see it. English opinion may argue the rights and wrongs of keeping a nuclear deterrent, but it’ll say, ‘We’re damned if we’ll allow Scotland to force us to give it up.’” Moreover: “This thing has been at the centre of the British state since the 1940s. If we scrapped it, the message to the countries that matter to the UK – to the US, to our European neighbours, to Canada and Australia – would just be puzzling. Why are you doing it at this moment? Is the UK bankrupt? It wouldn’t be a good message!” In other words, Scottish independence would if anything intensify the rUK’s need to perpetuate the nuclear deterrent. In a paper published by the Royal United Services Institute in 2014, Chalmers examined the case for rebasing the submarines at the present Royal Navy dockyard at Devonport and building a warheads dump and loading jetty (the equivalent of Coulport) on the Cornish coast near Falmouth. He estimated the cost, excluding land purchase, at between £3bn and £4bn over a building programme lasting 10 to 15 years, and predicted fierce local opposition. But despite these “significant political and financial barriers”, he and his co-author Hugh Chalmers (no relation) thought it might be “the best available option within rUK”. A cheaper solution in which British submarines sailed from French or American bases has practical difficulties (and would make the claim of independent control perhaps conclusively unsustainable). But, waiting to break surface from below these essentially political arguments, are two forbidding technical challenges. The first concerns the UK’s capability as a submarine builder – can a country that has been so industrially eviscerated actually build them? The story of the Royal Navy’s new Type 45 destroyers, recently revealed to have a fundamental flaw in their power system, is hardly a good omen. The construction of the Astute class attack submarines (SSNs), of which seven will eventually be built, has been troubled too. Hennessy and Jinks relate the events in their submarine history – how the work of warship design had been traditionally fulfilled in-house by the MoD’s Royal Corps of Naval Constructors, and how, by the time the first of the Astute class was ordered in 1997, a lot of this responsibility had been transferred to the builder. The MoD, in the words of an American industry report, had lost its “ability to be an informed and intelligent customer”. Lack of orders at the shipyard meant that the workforce had shrunk to 3,000 from the 13,000 employed at the height of the Vanguard programme. Many highly skilled engineers and constructors had left; layers of expertise had gone missing. The building schedule quickly ran into trouble – by 2002 the project was running three years late and several hundred million pounds over budget – and was rescued only when the MoD secured the help of more than 200 designers and engineers at the American submarine builder General Dynamics Electric Boat, which sent over a senior member of its staff to manage the project. A lesson has been learned: engineers from Electric Boat have been involved in the design of the Successor submarines from the beginning – about 40 of them now work on the project in the UK. But several innovations in the Successor programme make it an even trickier proposition than the Astute class – they include a new version of the Rolls-Royce reactor; a new propulsion unit adapted from an American design; and a joint missile compartment that will suit the needs of both British and American boats. Foreseeing problems ahead, last year’s defence review promised a new MoD team headed by “an experienced commercial specialist”, who would have “the authority and freedom to recruit and retain the best people to manage the submarine enterprise”. Again, the language is opaque. What it may conceal is a problem that is likely to stretch the capabilities of even the most resourceful engineers and submariners: the problem of transparent oceans. When in 1956 Khrushchev hailed the submarine as the great naval weapon of the future, the underwater made a marvellous hiding place. Submarines were hard for an enemy to track and find. “Stealth” was their operating principle – the Royal Navy remains proud even now of how its ballistic missile submarines avoided detection by Soviet attack submarines whose main purpose in the cold war was to find them. It was this combination of invisibility and mobility that had recommended them as missile platforms when land and air-based systems became vulnerable. But what if, thanks to new methods of detection, the sea became no more secure a hiding place for the submarine than the air was for the bomber? A growing number of military analysts think that technical developments are moving quickly in that direction. One of them is Paul Ingram, the director of the British American Security Information Council, a non-proliferation thinktank. According to Ingram, the “underwater battle space” will be transformed with the massive deployment of cheap sensors that will operate the sound equivalent of a net across relevant parts of the ocean. Additionally, shoals of underwater drones could be positioned or dropped at the entrance to the Firth of Clyde (or perhaps by that time, off Cornwall), ready to peel away and follow any submarine setting out on patrol; sensors that are acutely sensitive to unnatural water movement, many miles distant, could pinpoint a revolving propeller. How the Successor submarines would be able to avoid detection in this new environment was far from clear, Ingram said. Devices like these have still to be perfected, but the world’s militaries are pouring money into their development, At Nato’s Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation near La Spezia in northern Italy, and at more lavishly funded laboratories and workshops in Russia, China and the US, people go to work every day to make the big missile submarines redundant. By the time the first Successor submarine starts on its maiden voyage – 16 or more years from now – it may be as elusive to a sophisticated enemy as a white-hulled cruise ship. 9. Our battleships I first saw Faslane at the age of 13. One of Britain’s last battleships, HMS Anson, was being dismantled at the breaker’s yard that in those days occupied the bay. When I looked out from the train that summer afternoon in 1958, I was looking at a battleship that, incredible as it seems to me now, was only three years older than I was. The Anson made her first voyage under the white ensign in 1942. She and her sister ships King George V, Duke of York and Howe all reached the breakers’ yards within months of each other in the late 1950s, none of them having spent more than 10 years in active commission. The unluckier fifth sister, the Prince of Wales, lasted only 10 months before Japanese torpedo bombers sank her and the battle-cruiser Repulse in the South China Sea in December 1941, three days after Pearl Harbor. These were well-armoured ships, returning fire and moving at speed when the aircraft attacked them. The shock to Britain’s naval prestige was severe. Nothing quite like it had happened before. The war carried on. Battleships were occasionally useful – pounding Normandy with shellfire, for instance, before the D-day invasion. But what had seemed like advanced thinking on Admiralty drawing boards in 1936 were by 1950 obsolescent hulks. An earlier HMS Vanguard, predecessor to the present nuclear submarine, was the last battleship to be launched anywhere in the world; constant changes in design – many made in the light of the loss of the Prince of Wales – kept the hull on the slipway through most of the war and she was commissioned into the navy a year after the fighting in Europe had ended. Retired after nine years and scrapped, again at Faslane, in 1960, her most important voyage had been to take King George VI to a royal tour of South Africa. As a small boy, I saw her anchored a mile out to sea from our village, a big, grey two-funnelled shape with gun turrets that pointed straight ahead. “There’s the Vanguard,” people said, pointing through the haar, but she was there one morning and gone the next. The British navy has shrunk almost beyond recognition since then. In the book by Hennessy and Jinks, a submarine commander says that its personnel could “fit into Stamford Bridge and leave room for the away fans”. Despite the arms lobby and veterans’ Save the Navy campaigns, ships and crews have lost their purchase on the national imagination. Britain has become what sailors call “sea blind”, while the British military as a whole has still to recover the reputation and confidence that it lost in the misadventures of Iraq and Afghanistan. And yet Trident survives – and it seems will go on surviving despite the questions over its cost, purpose and durability and the ominous parallels with the battleship. Should we renew it? As someone of a certain generation and disposition, I find it hard to be absolutely sure. The boy who loved ships sits at odds with the teenager who wanted to ban the bomb. The world grows more hostile; unlike Jeremy Corbyn, I don’t believe that Britain’s renunciation of nuclear weapons would set an example pour encourager les autres. The sight of a nuclear submarine moving down the Clyde can still excite me in some unplumbable and perhaps regrettable way; the fact that Britain can still build them, when it builds so little else, is remarkable. But to set against these feelings, which come out of personal history and watching the news, stands the unassailable fact of Trident’s expense and the growing question of its usefulness. It has been a great triumph of British governments, and particularly the present government, to have successfully depicted any opposition to Britain’s nuclear strategy as the treacherous work of people “who cannot be trusted with the defence of the nation”. History tells a more muddled story. Nuclear weapons were never the done deal, the only way forward, that the ebullient certainties of politicians such as the present defence minister, Michael Fallon, would have us believe. They have been contentious inside the British establishment for 70 years, never properly scrutinised because opposition to them was usually based on moral and not practical grounds. If we didn’t already have them, would we want to acquire them? Nobody I talked to in the course of reporting this piece thought so, but the question is hypothetical. Trident may or may not keep us safe. The hope is, and always has been, that it will keep us important.

It breaks my heart","bodyText":"I am embarrassed. Last week I wrote in support of the government's plans to collect and share the medical records of all patients in the NHS, albeit with massive caveats. The research opportunities are huge, but we already knew that the implementation was chaotic, with poor public information, partly because the checks and balances on who gets access to data – and how – have not yet been devised or implemented. When you're proposing to share our most private medical records, vague promises and an imaginary regulatory framework are not reassuring. Now it's worse. On Monday, the Health and Social Care Information Centre admitted giving the insurance industry the coded hospital records of millions of patients, pseudonymised, but re-identifiable by anyone with malicious intent, as I explained last week. These were crunched by actuaries into tables showing the likelihood of death depending on various features such as age or disease, to help inform insurance premiums. We can reasonably disagree on whether you find this use of your medical records acceptable, but the process must be competent and transparent. The HSCIC has now told the BBC that this release of your medical records broke the rules, and that there may have been other similarly erroneous releases: but it won't say more until \"later this year\". On Tuesday, at a health select committee hearing, things got worse. HSCIC said it couldn't share documentation on these releases because it had all been done by its predecessor body, the NHS Information Centre – even though the HSCIC replaced the NHSIC in 2013, and is in the same building, doing the same job, with almost identical personnel and all the old records. Furthermore, the actuaries' report using the hospital data carries the HSCIC's logo – not the old NHSIC one – with the HSCIC's admitted full consent. If HSCIC disapproves of NHSIC releasing this data – or regards it as illegal – why did it add its logo and approval to the output? Also, is it really true that release to the insurance industry is unacceptable to the HSCIC? Its own information governance assessment from August says that access to individual patients records can \"enable insurance companies to accurately calculate actuarial risk so as to offer fair premiums to its [sic] customers. Such outcomes are an important aim of Open Data, an important government policy initiative.\" Is that document binding? What are the rules? Are there previous dodgy data-sharing arrangements, agreed by NHSIC, that the HSCIC is still honouring, with data still flowing out of the building? This is chaos. Then, on Thursday, to make things worse, public health minister Jane Ellison appears to have misled parliament, telling it that the data released by the HSCIC was \"publicly available, non-identifiable and in aggregate form\". This is utterly untrue. It was line-by-line data – every individual hospital episode, for every individual patient, with unique pseudonymous identifiers– which was then aggregated into summary tables by the actuaries. To summarise, a government body handed over parts of my medical records to people I've never met, outside the NHS and medical research community, but it is refusing to tell me what it handed over, or who it gave it to, and the minister is now incorrectly claiming that it never happened anyway. There are people in my profession who think they can ignore this problem. Some are murmuring that this mess is like MMR, a public misunderstanding to be corrected with better PR. They are wrong: it's like nuclear power. Medical data, rarefied and condensed, presents huge power to do good, but it also presents huge risks. When leaked, it cannot be unleaked; when lost, public trust will take decades to regain. This breaks my heart. I love big medical datasets, I work on them in my day job, and I can think of a hundred life-saving uses for better ones. But patients' medical records contain secrets, and we owe them our highest protection. Where we use them – and we have used them, as researchers, for decades without a leak – this must be done safely, accountably, and transparently. New primary legislation, governing who has access to what, must be written: but that's not enough. We also need vicious penalties for anyone leaking medical records; and HSCIC needs to regain trust, by releasing all documentation on all past releases, urgently. Care.data needs to work: in medicine, data saves lives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/blog/live/2014/oct/08/imf-global-growth-downgrade-sees-asian-shares-and-oil-prices-slide-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-08T16:53:13Z","webTitle":"IMF warns long period of low interest rates could trigger financial crisis – business live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/oct/08/imf-global-growth-downgrade-sees-asian-shares-and-oil-prices-slide-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/blog/live/2014/oct/08/imf-global-growth-downgrade-sees-asian-shares-and-oil-prices-slide-business-live","fields":{"headline":"IMF warns long period of low interest rates could trigger financial crisis – business live","bodyText":"Over to Greece where three days of debate on a confidence motion submitted by the country’s prime minister has just begun. The vote is likely to spark fierce denunciations of the government’s bailout programme. Helena Smith reports from Athens: For MPs gathered in Greece’s 300-seat parliament the choice is simple: either they vote for prime minister Antonis Samaras’ two-party coalition and allow it to adopt controversial reforms (the price of €24bn in aid from the EU and IMF) or they refuse to give it the mandate required to continue in office. With 154 lawmakers backing his administration, Samaras will almost certainly pass the test. But pundits are in no doubt that he will also get a run for his money. In a climate of high political tension, Alexis Tsipras, leader of the radical left main opposition Syriza party, has been sharpening his rhetorical sword, declaring that “a vote of confidence can only come form the people.” Syriza stalwarts say they will use the occasion to not only deliver a stinging rebuke of the government’s “catastrophic” policies, but as a chance to present their own “anti-austerity” programme. Indicative of the explosive atmosphere, Samaras was rounded on before the debate even began with MPs denouncing his absence. The conservative leader, who is in Milan attending an EU summit called to examine the issue of unemployment, will address the House on Friday in advance of the midnight ballot taking place. With international creditors demanding that Greece steps up its reform process, Samaras hopes the government will be further reinforced with backing from independent MPs – a move that would enable it to execute the measures lenders are baying for at a faster pace. Yields on Greek bonds have risen sharply, a reflection of investor fears that Athens is almost certainly in for a period of prolonged political paralysis if, as also looks likely, parliament fails to elect a president in February. Highlighting the dangers that lay ahead, Greece’s deputy premier Evangelos Venizelos warned that political uncertainty was not only undermining Athens’ shaky coalition but its economic achievements at a time when Greece was now plotting its exit from the bailout programme. More than ever, he said, the government needed a strong vote of confidence to avoid the spectre of the country being taken back to start of the eurozone crisis in 2009. “Five years of efforts, five years of hard sacrifices, could be destroyed in five days,” he told businessmen this week. “Five days are enough to take us back to 2009: budget deficits, no future, the collapse of competitiveness.” And on that note, it’s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow for - among other things - the outcome of the latest Bank of England meeting and, yes, EBC President Mario Draghi in Washington. The continuing combination of worries about a slowdown in economic growth, and geopolitical concerns such as the possible spread of the Ebola virus, combined once more to put markets under pressure. But an early rise on Wall Street ahead of the latest Federal Reserve minutes and the start of the US reporting season with Alcoa helped European markets come off their worst levels. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 13.34 points or 0.21% lower at 6482.24 Germany’s Dax dropped 1% to 8995.33 France’s Cac closed 0.97% lower at 4168.12 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.64% to 19,645.49 Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.88% at 10,339.0 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 19 points or 0.12% higher. As Italy’s prime minister Matteo Renzi asks coalition partners to back his labour reforms, Reuters is reporting that the EU commission is unlikely to accept the country’s multi-year budget plan. Renzi is expected to win a confidence vote later on the change to labour laws, but that is not his only concern at the moment. The EU commission is not keen on a proposal to delay achieving a balanced budget by a year until 2017, part of Italy’s stability programme unveiled last month. A commission source told Reuters it was “very improbable” that the proposal would be accepted, putting Italy in a similar position to France which has also seen commission disapproval over its fiscal plans. Oil prices are slipping back after higher than expected US crude oil inventories, up 5m barrels on the week. Brent crude is now down 1.2% at $90.97 a barrel. Now a quick bit of housekeeping: ECB President Mario Draghi’s speech at the Brookings Institute in Washington is tomorrow, Thursday, and not today. Here’s how the Institute describes the event (details here): The European Central Bank has been at the center of an economic, financial and political storm in the eurozone, the union of 18 (soon to be 19) sovereign nations that share a common currency and which still suffers from high unemployment, slow growth, and inflation below the ECB’s target. Its President, Mario Draghi, has on numerous occasions taken initiatives that have come to frame and define the policy debate in Europe, as he did with his recent address in Jackson Hole. How much more can monetary policy achieve in Europe? What lessons have been learned from this extraordinary period? Can the world’s central banks do better at maintaining financial stability than they have in the recent past? On October 9, the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings will host a presentation by the ECB President Mario Draghi on the latest developments in Europe and in global central banking. His remarks will be followed by a conversation between Mr. Draghi and Stanley Fischer, vice chair of the Federal Reserve Board. Here’s an interesting chart from the IMF: With this, it’s time for me to hand over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Thankyou for all your great comments, and good-bye. The press conference is over. Viñals is now talking about the need for more supervision of systemically important banks, across borders. Wall Street has started trading: The Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.01% lower while the Nasdaq was up 0.03%. The FTSE has recovered from earlier losses and is now down only 0.08% at 6490.53. The Guardian’s Larry Elliott asks: “What is the next sub-prime going to be?” In response, Viñals highlights the growth of the shadow banking system, particularly in the US. “Shadow banks” that operate outside the tightly regulated banking sector are providing financing where many traditional banks can’t fulfill that role. (Shadow banks are institutions such as hedge funds, money market funds and investment banks that do not take deposits from the public.) More in our story here. Back in London, the Office for National Statistics has confirmed the introduction of new economic well-being release. From December, the ONS will publish a regular set of indicators of economic well-being that supplement more traditional measures such as GDP and, it says, will give a more rounded and comprehensive basis for assessing changes in material well-being. ONS Chief Economic Adviser Joe Grice said: While it’s right that GDP plays a central role in monetary and fiscal policy, it has long been recognised as presenting an incomplete picture of how our society is doing. The UK will be one of the first countries to bring together official statistics on other measures that will tell us, for example, how households are doing, including how well off people are feeling. This can help inform important decisions by people businesses and policy makers. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at German insurer Allianz, has compiled a to-do list for the IMF and World Bank. Viñals called on governments to address the global imbalance on risk-taking and prevent excesses in financial risk-taking. Monetary policy cannot be the only game in town. He said structural policy, “smart fiscal policies” but also financial policies need to play their part. Turning to banks, Viñals says: The good news is that banks are much safer than they used to be a few years back. The not so good news is many banks don’t yet have the financial muscle to provide vigorous support to the recovery. José Viñals, the Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department of the IMF, says “the world is facing a new global imbalance”. There is not enough risk-taking in some areas – to encourage business investment – but “increasing excesses in financial risk-taking which may undermine stability.” The IMF press conference is under way. The Guardian’s Larry Elliott, who is in Washington, says the Wall Street Journal story about thermometers being handed to delegates at the IMF/World Bank meetings is a “bit of an exaggeration”. Offered to people coming to meetings from west Africa but not to all. I haven’t been given one! You can watch the IMF’s press conference live here. The International Monetary Fund has released its global financial stability report, in which the organisation warns that a prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates pose the threat of a fresh financial crisis by encouraging excessive risk taking on global markets. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: The Washington-based IMF said more than half a decade in which official borrowing costs have been close to zero had encouraged speculation rather than the hoped-for pick up in investment. In its half-yearly Global Financial Stability Report, the Fund said the risks to financial stability no longer came from the traditional banks but from the so-called shadow banking system – institutions such as hedge funds, money market funds and investment banks that don’t take deposits from the public. José Viñals, the IMF’s financial counsellor, said: Policymakers are facing a new global imbalance: not enough economic risk-taking in support of growth, but increasing excesses in financial risk-taking posing stability challenges. He added that the traditional banks were safer after the injection of additional capital but not strong enough to support economic recovery. More on the World Bank report on Ebola. With the death toll from Ebola now at 3,439 in the three worst-affected countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, the report says that if the epidemic was to significantly infect people in neighboring countries, some of which have much larger economies, the financial impact could reach $32.6bn by the end of 2015. The economic impact could be limited if immediate national and international action stop the epidemic and alleviate the “aversion behavior” or fear factor that is causing neighboring countries to close their borders, and airlines and other regional and international companies to suspend their commercial activities in the three worst-affected countries, the World Bank said. It added: The successful containment of Ebola in Nigeria and Senegal so far is evidence that this is possible, given some existing health system capacity and a resolute policy response. Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, said: With Ebola’s potential to inflict massive economic costs on Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone and the rest of their neighbors in West Africa, the international community must find ways to get past logistical roadblocks and bring in more doctors and trained medical staff, more hospital beds, and more health and development support to help stop Ebola in its tracks. At the IMF/World Bank meetings in Washington, delegates are being handed free thermometers as a “precaution” against Ebola, the Wall Street Journal reports. Thousands of finance officials, economists, bankers and reps from nonprofit organisations from nearly every nation are gathering in the US capital to debate the darkening economic outlook. They include officials from the West African nations where the outbreak is raging – Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Back to Ebola. The Ebola epidemic could cost the west African economy $32.6bn over the next year if officials don’t get to grips with it soon, the World Bank warned today. The economic impacts of Ebola are already very serious in the core three countries - particularly Liberia and Sierra Leone - and could become catastrophic under a slow-containment, high-Ebola scenario. A group of leading economic institutes in Germany is poised to slash its forecasts for economic growth, newspaper Handelsblatt reported. The institutes, whose analysis is used by the German government to compile its own forecasts, are now predicting 1.3% growth for this year and 1.2% in 2015 – compared with 1.9% and 2% previously. They are due to publish the new predictions on Thursday. They are below the IMF’s new forecasts, published yesterday, of 1.4% growth in 2014 and 1.5% in 2015. After a strong start to the year, Europe’s largest economy shrank by 0.2% in the second quarter and is expected to have barely grown in the third. A shock 4% fall in industrial output in August, the biggest since the height of the financial crisis, coupled with evidence of tumbling factory orders have triggered fears that Germany could slide back into recession. Following Tuesday’s warning from the IMF, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has chipped in and said that growth in the eurozone is losing momentum. My colleague Angela Monaghan reports: The Paris-based think tank’s monthly “composite leading indicactors” are designed to spot shifts in economic cycles early on. The latest snapshot suggests the German and Italian economies are most rapidly losing steam: In Europe, signs are emerging of a loss of growth momentum in the Euro area, with stronger signals in the case of Germany and Italy, while in France and in the United Kingdom the outlook continues to point to stable growth. Growth in Japan is also losing momentum, according to the OECD, while the indicators suggested growth momentum in the US, Canada, Russia, China and Brazil is stable. In India, growth is gaining momentum. Britain’s proposed £16bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, to be built by French utility EDF, has been given the green light in Brussels. The European Commission said Britain agreed to make significant changes to the terms of the project financing, reducing the burden on taxpayers. The controversial new power station is part of Britain’s strategy to replace a fifth of its ageing nuclear power and coal plants. The project is a big boost for EDF, giving it a a guaranteed power price of £92.50 per megawatt hour for 35 years, more than twice the current market rate. It is worth noting, as one reader, NicholasB pointed out, that the IMF did not downgrade the UK on Tuesday. It expects Britain to be the fastest-growing major economy this year, at 3.2% – compared with downgrades for the eurozone’s three biggest economies, Germany, France and Italy. Time for an update on the markets. The FTSE 100 index is now down nearly 0.6%, or 37.4 points, at 6458.18, while Germany’s Dax has lost 0.9% and France’s CAC is off 0.36%. On bond markets, British 30-year gilt prices hit their highest level in more than two years as investors piled into safe-haven assets. Brent crude oil has dipped below $91 a barrel, its lowest level since June 2012, after the gloomier global growth outlook raised concerns about demand for oil at a time of plentiful supply. The pound has weakened against the dollar after two days of gains, as data on falling prices in shops made it easier for the Bank of England to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5%. Sterling lost 0.25% to $1.6055 and was flat against the euro. Suggestions that the housing market is slowing also weighed on the currency. The pound surged over 15% against the dollar in the year to mid-July on expectations that the Bank of England could become the first major central bank to raise rates. However, it has slipped nearly 7% since then as expectations of a UK rate hike before the end of the year faded, with some speculation that the Fed could go first. There is more to come from the IMF today, as the organisation holds its autumn meeting in Washington. It will release its global financial stability report at 2pm BST. The OECD is releasing its leading indicators report, looking at the growth outlook, at 11am BST. KFC owner Yum Brands has warned on profits after a meat scare in China rocked sales. Like-for-like sales in the last quarter plunged 14% in its largest market, after allegations that fast-food chains including KFC and McDonald’s were supplied meat past its expiration date. Yum is the biggest foreign restaurant chain operator in China with more than 6,400 outlets. Back to Spain, where industrial production growth slowed in August, disappointing economists. Output rose just 0.6% compared with a revised 0.9% gain in July. Production of consumer goods remained flat in August while capital goods and energy fell 4% and 1.4% respectively. Mike Ashley, the founder of retailer Sports Direct and owner of Newcastle United, is now trying to stir things up at Scottish club Rangers where he is a major shareholder. Just six days after doubling his holding in Rangers to almost 9%, Ashley called for an emergency meeting to have the club’s chief executive Graham Wallace and director Philip Nash ousted from the board. More here. Meanwhile, Air France issued a profit warning in the aftermath of last month’s two-week pilot strike, one of the longest in the airline’s history. It put the cost of the strike at €500m in lost revenue. The French flag carrier was in dispute with pilots over plans to expand its budget subsidiary Transavia to compete with the likes of easyJet and Ryanair (ironically, easyJet benefited hugely from the strike). Air France pilots are demanding the right for future pilots to be recruited on the same conditions (i.e. pay and benefits) as those currently working for the main airline, a point on which management won’t budge. It argues it can’t run a budget airline at Air France costs. Shares in travel companies including budget carrier Easyjet, Iberia owner International Airlines Group and cruise company Carnival are down for a second day after a Spanish nurse became the first person outside Africa to contract the deadly Ebola virus. Fears that this could put people off travelling or that travel restrictions could be imposed hit travel companies. EasyJet shares lost nearly 3% this morning, Carnival was down almost 2% while IAG and Tui Travel shed 1.9%. European shares have dropped to 1 1/2 month lows after the IMF downgrade triggered fresh fears over the world economy. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.6% to 1321.28, marking its lowest level since mid-August. Jonathan Sudaria, trader at London Capital Group, said: The IMF laid it on pretty thick yesterday... and topped it off with the cherry that global growth may never reach its pre-crisis levels ever again. In the short term at least, it appears that traders have also come to the same conclusion as there is no apparent let-up in the selling pressure this morning. On the corporate front, shares in FirstGroup fell nearly 6% to 108.3p after the Aberdeen-based company lost the contract to operate the £2.5bn ScotRail franchise to Abellio, an offshoot of Dutch national railways. The Halifax house price index is out: it shows house prices across the UK rising by 0.6% in September, more than expected. In the three months to September, prices climbed 9.6% on an annual basis, down from 9.7% in the three months to August. The mortgage lender reckons annual house price inflation has peaked around 10% and growth is likely to slow in coming months. European stock markets have opened lower. The FTSE 100 index is down nearly 30 points, or 0.45%, at 6466.28. Germany’s Dax has tumbled 0.7%, France’s CAC and Italy’s FTSE MIB have both shed 0.2% and Spain’s Ibex is down 0.4%. UBS global economist Paul Donovan is rather scathing about the IMF’s forecasting ability. Markets seem to be exhibiting some signs of concern about the pace of global growth, at least during Asian trading. The cited reason is IMF forecast downgrades, but that does not really make sense. The IMF always lags the consensus on GDP, and is not known for its pinpoint forecasting accuracy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. The International Monetary Fund’s global growth downgrade has weighed heavily on equity markets around the world. The IMF warned on Tuesday that the world economy might never again enjoy the pace of expansion seen before the financial crisis. It cut its global growth forecast to 3.3% for this year, from 3.4%, pointing to weakness in the eurozone, Japan and big emerging markets such as Brazil. A shock fall in German industrial output compounded the news. After a sell-off on Wall Street – the Dow Jones tumbled 1.6% while the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.5% and the Nasdaq 1.56% – many Asian stock markets followed suit. Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.2%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.7% and the Australian stock market shed 0.9%. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1%. Growth fears sent oil prices to 27-month lows: Brent oil tumbled $1.18 to $90.93 a barrel while US crude fell $1.07 to $87.78. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is due to speak at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, at 4pm UK time. Minutes of the US Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting are due later (7pm UK time)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/feb/26/natalie-hynde-ban-fracking-uk-protest-balcombe","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-26T11:41:09Z","webTitle":"Why we need an outright ban on fracking in the UK | Natalie Hynde","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/26/natalie-hynde-ban-fracking-uk-protest-balcombe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/26/natalie-hynde-ban-fracking-uk-protest-balcombe","fields":{"headline":"Why we need an outright ban on fracking in the UK","bodyText":"Getting arrested for taking part in direct action at Balcombe was the most liberating experience I've ever had. Nothing I've ever done in my life has made me feel so empowered and alive. Anyone can Google the \"List of the Harmed\" or look at the Shalefield Stories detailing what's happened to people in the US as a result of fracking – the nosebleeds, the cancers, the spontaneous abortions in livestock, the seizures and silicosis in the worker's lungs. Not to mention the farming revenue lost from sick and dying cattle. When you have exhausted all other channels of democratic process – written letters, gone on marches and signed petitions – direct action seems the only way left to get your voice heard. In the US, this industry has buried people's stories and threatened their livelihoods if they dare to speak out. Researchers from the Colorado School of Public Health have found that a number of toxic, and carcinogenic, petroleum hydrocarbons in the air near fracking wells include benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and xylene, which cause acute and chronic health problems for those living nearby. In the UK we are told that it will bring energy prices down. Most people do not understand that the exploration wells that we are seeing at the moment are just the start. Unconventional gas will require tens of thousands of wells over huge areas of the country. Production will require pipelines, compressor stations and waste disposal on a massive scale. The tiny exploration companies will be replaced by massive firms when they sell the information and licences they have gathered. Fracking releases methane into the Earth's atmosphere which is a much more potent greenhouse gas, between 20 and 100 times more so, than CO2. This is a time when we should be meeting our climate change obligations, not worsening the situation by injecting a chemical cocktail of carcinogens into the earth's crust. A lot of us want the moratorium that was lifted in 2012 to be reinstated – due to new evidence and significant Royal Society/RIE recommendations not having been followed. We've already had two earthquakes in Blackpool and the property market in the town has tanked as a result of the fracking. In the exploratory drilling process, the range of chemicals, including hydrochloric acid, pose a massive threat if they escape from the well. All wells leak eventually – 6% of gas wells leak immediately and 50% of all gas wells leak within 15 years. Following on from the Lock the Gate protest in Australia, communities are being inspired to spread information and prepare for when fracking is introduced to their area. Taking part in nonviolent direct action will cause the investors to think twice – we need more people to get involved, even at the risk of getting arrested. Nothing is in place in the UK at the moment to deal with all the radioactive toxic waste water that we're left with after the land has been fracked. In other words, they've said yes to fracking without having all of the necessary waste water treatment procedures in place. Some believe it won't be possible to treat it at all, in which case they will end up dumping it in estuaries and elsewhere. Once that water is contaminated it can't be reversed – it is in the water cycle forever. Many people think UK shale gas would provide us with energy security, but what does that mean? People don't realise the Chinese have already invested in iGas and Cuadrilla. The environment is not considered at all. Do we want to leave this mess for the next generation? Why hasn't the public been informed of the risks? Why are they rushing it through? Why are they offering bribes to local communities? Why has France banned fracking? Why is the French company Total investing in fracking in the UK? Why is the French-owned EDF allowed to build nuclear power stations in the UK? We need an outright ban on fracking – or at the very least, a moratorium."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2012/jul/30/japan-green-party-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-30T14:24:51Z","webTitle":"Anti-nuclear campaigners launch Japan's first green party","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/30/japan-green-party-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jul/30/japan-green-party-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Anti-nuclear campaigners launch Japan's first green party","bodyText":"Anti-nuclear campaigners in Japan have launched the country's first green party, more than a year after the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi power plant created a groundswell of opposition to atomic energy. Greens Japan, created by local politicians and activists, hopes to satisfy the legal requirements to become an officially recognised political party in time for the general election, which must be held by next summer but could come much earlier. The party said it would offer voters a viable alternative to the two main parties, both of which have retained their support for nuclear power, particularly after the recent decision to restart two nuclear reactors in western Japan. The ruling Democratic party of Japan and the minority opposition Liberal democratic party [LDP] both supported the nuclear restart, which came after Japan was briefly left without nuclear power for the first time in more than 40 years. Akira Miyabe, Greens Japan's deputy leader, said voters had been deprived of the chance to support a party that puts nuclear abolition and other green policies at the top of its agenda. \"We need a party that puts the environment first,\" he said at a launch event in Tokyo. The 1,000-member party is still a gathering of disparate groups and local politicians, but believes it can emulate green parties in Germany and other parts of Europe and influence the national debate over energy policy. Nao Suguro, a co-leader of the party who sits on a local assembly in Tokyo, said the aim was \"to create a broad network to accommodate calls for the abolition of nuclear power plants.\" The party will struggle to field any candidates if, as some predict, the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, calls a snap lower house election. But it said it was prepared to put up about 10 candidates in next summer's upper house elections. Recent demonstrations in Tokyo suggest Japan's anti-nuclear movement has broken free of its long association with socialist and pacifist movements to include younger campaigners, many of whom are protesting for the first time. The protests are among the biggest Japan has seen in decades, although they have not succeeded in forcing Noda to reconsider his support for the restart of several reactors to avoid power cuts and lessen Japan's dependence on expensive fossil fuel imports. While thousands of demonstrators held a candlelit vigil and formed a chain around the parliament building in Tokyo on Sunday night, voters in Yamaguchi prefecture in south-west Japan elected a pro-nuclear governor in a poll that some saw as a litmus test of Japan's enthusiasm for atomic energy. Shigetaro Yamamoto, a former bureaucrat who was supported by the conservative LDP, defeated three rivals, including Tetsunari Iida, who had campaigned against the proposed construction of a nuclear power plant in the area. That vote came after other recent wins for pro-nuclear candidates in local elections. The government is currently sounding out public opinion on three options for nuclear energy's share of the country's energy mix in 2030: zero, 15% or 20-25%. Japan depended on nuclear power for about a third of its energy needs before the 11 March disaster."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/feb/17/nuclear-power-expensive-gamble","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-17T15:56:41Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power is an expensive gamble that may (or may not) pay off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/17/nuclear-power-expensive-gamble","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/feb/17/nuclear-power-expensive-gamble","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power is an expensive gamble that may (or may not) pay off","bodyText":"Britain's energy future starts in Paris with David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy signing formal agreements for the UK and France to work together on nuclear power. Attention will soon shift to a 500-hectare (1,250-acre) plot in Somerset where the French state energy giant EDF hopes to start work on Hinkley C. If all goes to plan, the first nuclear power station to be built in Britain since 1995 will have a capacity of 2,000MW when operational in 2018-2019. The reality is that few, if any, of the world's 435 working nuclear power stations were built to cost, or on schedule – the prototypes of the two stations EDF wants to build in Britain have taken far longer and proved much more expensive to build than anyone ever expected. The Paris agreements only allow preparatory work to start, but they do establish one version of the low-carbon electricity future that climate change demands. The deals also address the fact that Britain has very few young engineers to run what may eventually be eight or more nuclear stations, by providing money for a training centre in Bridgwater, Somerset. However, while EDF's earth-movers arrive in Somerset for Hinkley C, questions about radioactive waste management, long-term fuel supplies, vulnerability to terrorist attack, the risk of radiation, decommissioning, coastal siting, flooding, exorbitant costs and accident liabilities which were all skated over in consultations last year, have not been answered and are likely to come back to haunt governments for generations. Nuclear critics, like the former energy secretary Chris Huhne, argue that nuclear energy is a tried and failed technology which has needed hundreds of billions of pounds of state subsidies and sweeteners but still generates expensive and dangerous energy. The question hanging over Britain's new stations will be whether cheaper, safer, alternatives become available. If so, Britain will be embarrassed, chained to a massively expensive technology that will suck in resources for ever. If they do not, the decision to build them may prove to be one of the most far-sighted taken by any government. • This article was amended on 20 February.

Here is how things looked at the close for the European bourses, helped by that news this morning that eurozone GDP increased by 0.4% in the April-June period, not the 0.3% first estimated three weeks ago. As reported earlier, the top loser on the FTSE 100 was Whitbread, after the owner of Costa coffee shops and Premier Inn hotels said it expected to cut spending and increase some prices to counter the “substantial” cost of the “national living wage”, as it posted slowing second-quarter sales. Over on Wall Street, shares are also higher as traders return from the long Labor Day weekend. On commodity markets, copper has climbed to a four-week high as US traders caught up with announcements about mine closures made on Monday that look set to dampen supply. Oil prices are also higher, up 3.7% to $49.4 for a barrel of Brent crude, but that was not enough to wipe away a 6% drop in Monday’s session. On Wednesday, the UK will be in focus early on with official figures due out on industrial production and on trade in July. They will be scrutinised for clues as to how the Bank of England’s committee of interest rate setters is feeling about the UK outlook ahead of their latest policy announcement on Thursday. No-one expects a hike, but minutes from the meeting, also released on Thursday at noon, are expected to show at least one of the nine monetary policy committee members voting for a rise from the current 0.5% record low. Ahead of the data, here’s a little reminder of where the various sectors of the UK economy stand relative to their pre-crisis peaks. The vast service industry, which covers a host of activities from hairdressing to banking, is the only part of the economy in which output has exceeded pre-downturn levels. Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec, says the industrial production data, and the breakdown on the manufacturing sector, could well bring more downbeat news on the nature of the UK recovery: The UK economy looks to be firmly in two speed mode with the services sector looking to be expanding solidly whilst manufacturers suffer a tougher ride, dragged down, in particular, by sterling strength. On that note, the export figures in Wednesday’s trade data will also be studied for signs the strong pound and shaky business confidence from the eurozone to China are hurting overseas sales. That’s all for today. Thanks for reading and the comments, as ever. We will be back in the morning to cover whatever stock market swings the next session brings for China, those UK figures and other business and economics news from around the world. Talking of Whitbread’s complaints about the “national living wage”, the chancellor has been answering questions about his new minimum pay rates this afternoon. Osborne, announced a bumper pay increase in July, with the current £6.50 minimum wage set to rise to £7.20 for those aged over 25 from next April. The rate will grow steadily over the following four years to about £9.35 an hour. Osborne is currently appearing in front of the Lords economic affairs committee where there have been questions about changes and their potential impact on employers and employees. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering the committee hearing in his politics live blog, but here’s a flavour of the exchange on the “national living wage” - which, by the way, is not to be confused with the (higher) living wage as advocated by the Living Wage Foundation and paid by some employers. Q: How will you ensure people losing money from the cuts to tax credits have time to get used to their lower income? Osborne says he is proposing a compact to the country. To business, he is saying their taxes will be low, but they have to pay higher wages. And to families he is saying welfare will be less generous, but wages will be higher. He says current welfare spending is unsustainable. Ramping up tax credits in a way that made them unaffordable was irresponsible. Originally they were supposed to cost less than £1bn. But they ended up costing £30bn. Q: How will the social care sector be able to cope with the higher national minimum wage? Osborne says he is aware of this issue. He plans to address it in the spending review. Osborne has also been responding to questions about plans to build new nuclear power generating capacity at the Hinkley Point power station. He said told the committee: “I am pretty confident that we are going to be able to do a deal, but we are still in the negotiations.” The FTSE 100 has now closed and has managed to clock up another day of gains. Building on Monday’s mosest o.5% rise, the index of London-listed bluechips has ended today’s session up another 1.2%, or 72 points, at 6,146.1. Traders say this morning’s upgraded growth figures for the eurozone brought a much needed boost to market sentiment after the turmoil of recent weeks. Glencore was the top riser as investors continued to welcome Monday’s announcement of a big shake-up and debt-slashing plans from the commodities trading platform and mining company. Glencore shares closed up 4.4% at 136p. Whitbread, the coffee and hotels chain, was the biggest loser of the day. The shares lost 1.6% to £46.36 after it said expected to cut spending and increase some prices to counter the “substantial” cost of the “national living wage”, as it posted slowing second-quarter sales. Although the Dow hogs the headlines, the S&amp;P 500 is a better measure of the health of the US stock market. And it’s gained 1.5% today, meaning the index has burst back out of correction territory (defined as being 10% below the recent high). That underlines that US investors are less gloomy; partly on hopes of more Chinese stimulus measures to shore up its economy. We should remember that US stocks fell pretty heavily on Friday, as Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets points out: The near 2% surge in US markets is mostly a bounce back from Friday’s sell-off but weak Chinese trade data possibly sets the tone for more stimulus from China. The logic is that the PBOC won’t want to rock markets with one-off currency devaluation. More likely, China will be more incremental in weakening the exchange rate with more cuts to bank reserves and interest rates if the economy still shows signs of slowing. Shares of Apple jumped over 2.5% on the open, taking the tech sector higher with it, though in a notable sign of weakness, shares of Twitter and Netflix were both trading lower. Here are the stocks leading the rally in New York today: The wave of optimism on Wall Street has pushed every share on the Dow Jones industrial average higher, after one hour’s trading. The Dow is up around 235 points, or 1.46%, while the tech stock-heavy Nasdaq has gained almost 2%. Traders are taking heart that the Chinese stock market didn’t crash while they were away for Labor Day on Monday (reminder, the Shanghai Composite index jumped by 3% today). And although today’s trade data was ugly, that raises the chances that central bankers will maintain very loose monetary policy for longer. And that’s invariably good for stock prices. Markus Huber, a senior analyst at Peregrine &amp; Black, says fears of a Chinese implosion have eased: “With volatility having receded somewhat during the past few days it appears that investors have been reassessing the potential negative fallout from the slowdown in China.” European stock markets are also holding onto their earlier gains, with around 45 minutes trading to go. And they’re back! Moscow’s bourse is up and running again, and the stock market has dipped slightly. No word on what caused the outage, though. Moscow’s stock market is nearly ready to open after that glitch: Shares on Wall Street are rising at the start of trading, as New York traders catch up with events since the weekend. The Dow Jones jumped by 304 pints, or nearly 2%, with talk that today’s weak Chinese trade figures might prompt more stimulus measure from Beijing. Microsoft, Apple, Walmart and Intel are among the big names gaining 2%, in the first session after Monday’s Labor Day break. Back in Greece, anti-austerity rebels have won the support of the legendary leftist Manolis Glezos in what some say will be a major endorsement for the anti-euro Popular Unity party. Helena Smith reports Glezos, whose first act of resistance was to remove the Swastika from the Acropolis days after German soldiers marched into Athens in 1941, has finally broken his silence announcing he will back the MPs who rebelled against Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras after he caved into the demands of creditors. In a speech aired in the last 20 mins as Popular Unity leader Panagiotis Lafazanis addressed reporters at the country’s annual trade fair, Glezos said the time had come to “open the door so that visions and hope can pass.” “History is now calling on citizens to take fate their hand,” added the nonagenarian appealing to “old fighters” who had been on the frontline of battles for freedom and justice to join the party. “These elections are decisive, they provide the opportunity for the rotten status quo to be destroyed and for the fighter to prove himself.” Glezos’ decision to back the dissidents will be tough for Tsipras whom he mentored during his early days in office. The move comes as Popular Unity launches its tongue-in-cheek TV adverts, with Lafazanis heading to the National Mint to get Grexit underway. Here’s one for the daredevil bond traders among you - Iraq is getting ready to issue sovereign debt for the first time in nine years. Officials from the Iraqi government will meet with City bankers on Thursday to gauge interest. They want to raise funds to cover its budget deficit, triggered by the cost of fighting Islamic State militants and the falling oil price. Reuters says the roadshow should be successful, but at a price... Despite the political risks in Iraq, its status as OPEC’s second biggest oil producer is expected to ensure buyers for its debt; its huge southern oil fields have not been directly touched by the fighting, and it has embarked on an ambitious multi-year plan to raise crude output. Baghdad is expected to pay a high price for its borrowing, however; Iraq’s outstanding US dollar bond maturing in 2028 is trading at a yield of 10.37%. It’s a tricky time for Iraq to be selling debt, given the shake-out in the emerging markets. Staff at the Moscow stock exchange are racing to restart trading using a back-up system, CNBC reports: Moscow’s stock market appears to have suffered an unexpected problem. Trading on the bourse was temporarily suspended a few minutes ago, with reports of an “emergency situation”. FastFT reckon it’s due to a fault with network equipment at the exchange’s data centre, leaving people unable to trade shares, bonds, currencies or derivatives. The MICEX index had risen by around 1.2% before the sudden halt. European stock markets have pushed higher today, thanks to the upgraded eurozone growth figures. Germany’s record-breaking trade figures also cheered investors, following the news of China’s slumping imports. This has driven the German DAX up over 2%, with other markets close behind: Wall Street is expected to gain around 1.5% when trading begins, in an hour’s time. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, market analyst at London Capital Group, says traders are anticipating further stimulus measures from central banker, especially given China’s weakness. Following further contraction in Chinese trade terms in August, the European and the US stock indices painted the equity picture in green on strengthening belief that central banks’ would not dare taking their hands off the blurry financial markets in the immediate future. Almost every poll in Greece now shows former ruling Syriza neck and neck with centre right New Democracy. And as the snap ballot on September 20 draws nearer, uglier, as our correspondent Helena Smith explains: There were extraordinary scenes this morning on state-run TV between erstwhile Syriza minister Panos Skourletis and the New Democracy MP Manolis Kefaloyiannis. Accused of being “a liar and ignoramus” by Skourletis, the conservative shot back: You are stupid. I have studied at the London School of Economics, what shit have you done?” In protest, Skourletis then interrupted the morning chat show by fleeing the studio. If that wasn’t enough, former Syriza cadre and president of the parliament Zoe Konstantopoulou has upped the ante by accusing former prime minister Alexis Tsipras of destroying Syriza by embracing policies it had vowed to oppose. The fiery Konstantopoulou, who has now thrown her weight behind the breakaway Popular Unity party, challenged her former friend and comrade to a debate. Thus far, there has been no response from the Syriza leader. Konstantopoulou may have her detractors but she is as sharp as a whip and, without doubt, one of parliament’s most articulate MPs. With just 12 days until the Greek general election, political parties are releasing unusually light-hearted TV ads. A prime example is the 37-second ‘campaign’ trailer put out by the anti- austerity anti-euro group Popular Unity this morning. It shows leader Panagiotis Lafazanis hailing a taxi, and asking to be driven straight to the National Mint -- to start work producing fresh drachma. Very droll.... Behind the winning (?) smile, Lafazanis’s message is that Popular Unity can extract Greece from its current bailout deal: That message worked well for Alexis Tsipras in January’s election; implementing the promise proved harder than he expected, though. Timo del Carpio, European economist at RBC Capital Markets, sees “rather encouraging” signs in today’s GDP figures: As we had expected, private consumption provided an important impulse behind the recovery in the second quarter of 2015 (as it has for the last nine quarters). But this time around, it was also accompanied by a measurable boost from net trade, which added +0.3pp to top-line growth. At first glance this might seem somewhat out of whack with the signs of weakness in certain emerging market trading partners. However, we think it is consistent with the view that, in the short-term, that weakness should be offset by the growing recovery in other advanced economies. However, eurozone companies did cut back on investment last quarter. This ‘gross fixed capital formation’ is still around 15% below its pre-crisis levels. Today’s growth data is “a double dose of modest good news” for the eurozone, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. He points out that year-on-year eurozone growth hit a four-year high of 1.5% in the second quarter, up from from 1.2% in the first thee months of 2015. Archer explains that the drama over Greece’s bailout this summer may have held back growth: The euro and oil prices remained at highly supportive levels to Eurozone growth in the second quarter, although they were above their first quarter lows. However, the Eurozone’s ability to kick on may well have been hampered by heightened uncertainty weighing down on business and consumer confidence as the Greek crisis came to a head and concerns over global growth increased. Even with today’s upward revisions, the eurozone’s growth rate remains somewhat modest. Growth rates of 0.5% in Q1, and 0.4% in Q2, are still modest by international standards, especially given the boost from cheap energy prices and the ECB’s QE programme. Today’s data revisions show the eurozone’s recovery is on stronger foundations, argues Bloomberg’s Maxime Sbaihi. More good news: The eurozone’s growth in the first three month of 2015 has also been revised higher, from 0.4% to 0.5%. The eurozone is growing faster than thought, after statistics body Eurostat revised its GDP figures for the last quarter. GDP increased by 0.4% in the April-June period, not the 0.3% first estimated three weeks ago. It’s partly due to stronger growth in Italy, whose growth rate was revised up from 0.2% to 0.3%. It’s a much-need dose of good news for the euro area, five days after the European Central Bank cut its growth forecasts. It may calm some worries over Europe’s ability to withstand a slowdown in emerging markets as China tries to rebalance its economy. However, France remains a big concern, reporting no growth during the quarter. Eurostat reports that household spending drove the recovery, by increasing by 0.4% in the eurozone. Trade also made a positive contribution, with exports up by 1.6% and imports up by 1%. Reaction to follow.... Germany is calming some of the worries about China, by reporting record-breaking trade figures for July. Seasonally adjusted German exports climbed by 2.4% month-on-month, to €103.4bn, while imports grew 2.2% to €80.6bn. That’s the biggest readings since 1991 (after reunification) when the survey began, and much stronger than economists expected. More here. Back in the UK, hotels and coffee chain Whitbread has warned it may raise prices to cover the cost of implementing the new “national living wage”. Chancellor George Osborne announced in July’s budget that the £6.50 minimum wage (for over 25s) will rise to £7.20 from next April, and reach £9.35 an hour by 2010. This means a “substantial cost increase”, Whitbread told investors this morning, meaning it will increase prices, cut costs and increase productivity. £7.20 per hour works out at just under £15,000 per year (before tax), so low-paid Whitbread employees won’t be buying many racehorses next year. Some customers might even welcome the change: Whitbread isn’t alone, though; all UK companies must be making the same calculations. Recruitment firm Manpower has warned today that firms could try to dodge paying workers more, by taking on younger or self-employed workers, who are not entitled to the living wage. The decline in China’s imports will have serious consequences for other countries, points out FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunug: The China trade figures released overnight continued to highlight further weakness in the China economy, with both exports and imports declining. The continual decline in imports suggests that China is shifting away from an import dependent nation to one which is encouraging consumers to look more within the domestic market for its products and services. This change in approach will translate to further weakness for economies that have become dependent on demand from China. Iron ore imports contracted by around 14% last month; bad news for mining giants in Australia and Brazil. Fact of the morning: Beijing has now spent some $236bn supporting its stock market since June. That’s according to Goldman Sachs analysts, who say China’s “National Team” pumped $94bn into shares in August alone, in an attempt to manage the selloff. China also banned large shareholders from ditching their assets, and ordered state-owned companies to buy shares - and still saw the market plunge last month. In the City, shares in insurance firm Amlin have surged by 32% after Japan’s Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance announced a £3.46bn takeover deal. Amlin shares are trading at 655p, close to the 670p offer price, suggesting the deal is expected to go through. Bloomberg reckons that the announcement sent sterling rallying against the yen. Traders may be calculate that more Japanese firms will start buying up foreign assets, in a search for growth. Another wild day’s trading in Shanghai has ended, with the stock market up 3%. Quite a turnaround. European stock markets aren’t too bothered by the Chinese trade data. The main indices are all up around 1% in early trading: Maybe investors have already ‘priced in’ the slowdown: Over to Tony Cross of TrustNet: It’s been another positive start for trade in London this morning with traders clearly not feeling too unnerved by those weaker than expected trade figures out of China. Perhaps most worrying is the 13% slump in imports, but with commodity prices seeming to have found something of a floor of late, many mining stocks are once again floating towards the upper end of the index. China has found an innovative way of preventing any more Black Mondays - close the stock market when shares fall (or rise) too much, and send everyone home. From Shanghai, Jennifer Duggan reports: China is planning a “circuit breaker” mechanism to prevent any further losses on its volatile stock markets as both of the country’s leading indexes continued to slide. According to draft regulation, trading would be suspended for 30 minutes when the market rose or fell by 5%. If the index went up or down by 7% or more, trading would be suspended for the day. The mechanism could only be triggered once a day. “Circuit breaker in both directions will be conducive to curbing excessive transactions and reining in market fluctuations,” the draft from the securities regulator said. Full story here: Economists are concerned by the fall in Chinese imports and exports last month. Ma Guangyuan, an independent Chinese economist, says the economic picture is deteriorating. “The August data followed the trend set in July. Now the global slowdown has very much become a reality.” (via the FT) The fateful decision to allow the yuan to weaken last month hasn’t boosted Chinese exporters yet. As Liu Xuezhi, a Shanghai-based macro-economy analyst at China’s Bank of Communications, says: “China is set to miss its export growth target for this year, and there will be no help from the external demand side for economic growth.” (via Bloomberg) Emerging market currencies are also weakening today, as fears of a Chinese slowdown reverberate. The Malaysian ringgit has hit a new 17-year low against the US dollar today, amid concerns that American interest rates could soon rise . Investors in Tokyo baulked at the Chinese trade data too. Japan’s Nikkei fell by 2.4% by the close of trading, as nervous traders pushed up the value of the yen (which hurts exporters). That means the index has lost all its gains this year. The Shanghai stock market dropped into the red after today’s trade data was released. Curiously, though, it’s now rallying in late trading, suggesting the Chinese authorities may be intervening.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. If you’re not worried about the China’s economy yet, it might be time to start. The latest trade data, released earlier today, underline that the country’s economy is weakening, sending fresh ripples through the financial sector Imports into China slumped by 13.8% (in dollar terms) year-on-year, while exports were 5.5% lower. That suggests weakening activity within the Chinese economy, and sluggish global demand too. No wonder Biejing trimmed its growth forecast for 2015 over the weekend, from 7.4% to 7.3%. Perhaps that’s still too optimistic. European markets might inch a little higher at the open, and Wall Street is expected to jump after yesterday’s Labor Day holiday. Not much in the economics calendar today, beyond the second estimate of eurozone GDP at 10am. We’ll also be watching political developments in Greece, ahead of the election on September 20."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2013/jul/29/scientists-greens-children-enlightenment","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-29T10:53:00Z","webTitle":"Like scientists, greens are children of the Enlightenment | Anne Chapman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/jul/29/scientists-greens-children-enlightenment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2013/jul/29/scientists-greens-children-enlightenment","fields":{"headline":"Like scientists, greens are children of the Enlightenment","bodyText":"The green movement obviously owes a great deal to science: the impacts of pollution, the threat of climate change, the loss of species, can only be spoken about because of the scientific research that has made them known. Without this knowledge from science the green movement in its current form would not exist. Like scientists, greens are children of the Enlightenment. Both tend to think that decisions are, or at least should be, made on the basis of rational arguments, by appeal to the evidence. However, greens are also children of Romanticism. This legacy makes them aware of the limits of science, both in the sense of the limits to its knowledge, and that science is not sufficient to tell us how to live. Science is not enough. In particular, science should not be the only voice when it comes to decisions about technology: science and technology are not all of a piece, but are distinct, governed by different norms and we should use different criteria when judging them. It is in this area that greens have in recent years been accused of being anti-science; in particular in their opposition to genetically modified foods and to nuclear power (see for example Mark Lynas or Mark Henderson's Geek Manifesto). Science, the argument goes, has judged that the risks from these technologies are low and that the technologies need to be used if we are to meet our future needs for food and energy. Greens' opposition to them is therefore irrational. A key part of this argument is the concept of risk as it is used in technical risk assessments. Most regulatory regimes require the safety of technologies to be assessed by a risk assessment process whereby possible ways in which the technology may cause harm are identified and their probability estimated. If no harmful outcome can be identified there is no risk; and risks are low if the possible harmful outcome, even if of very large consequence, is considered to be of low probability. In contrast, I argue that greens, and in fact much of the public in general, consider novel technologies such as GM food to be risky, because even if we cannot identify what harm they may cause, the extent of our ignorance is such that for all we know harm is possible. Technical risk assessment tends to consider probability and size of harm together, as if the two were commensurable: a low probability of a large amount of harm comes out as equivalent to a high probability of a small harm – they both give the same number of \"deaths per year\". But high impact/low probability outcomes may be of much more concern that low impact/high probability ones. Events that cause some harm, but are not catastrophic can strengthen a system (Nassim Taleb has coined the term antifragile to describe this sort of system). High impact, catastrophic events wipe it out. Nuclear power is obviously risky. It is not a matter of the number of people it has or has not killed but the fact that it requires elaborate safety systems and armed guards at nuclear power stations. Genetic engineering is risky because it is attempting to engineer a system we have only very partial knowledge of. People are aware that organisms grow, reproduce and spread; they fear that once a genetically modified organism has been released into the environment it will not be possible to get it back, should we later discover that it is not as benign as we originally thought. Green objections to these technologies are not objections to science. They are objections to an over-confidence (which perhaps scientists working on a technology do tend to have) in our ability to predict consequences, control events and not make mistakes. If we are going to use risky technologies, technologies that are meddling in things that we only half understand, there need to be very good reasons for doing so. This is the second strand of greens' objection to these technologies: that they are not essential to meeting real human needs (as opposed to corporate interests). There are other, lower risk ways of generating energy without adding to greenhouse gas emissions (for example the vision put forward in Zero Carbon Britain), and GM technology is not the best way to solve the problems that need solving in the food system (an argument made, for example, by Colin Tudge) Finally, our choices about technology help to construct the world that we live in. Technology helps to determine the possibilities for human life, and the relationships between individuals and the organisations they create, as well as the impact that human living has on non-human nature. For the green movement, more than any other political force, technology is political. This post is part of a series on science and the green movement following debate at this year's Science in Public conference.

The 120,000 matt-black panels laid out in long, neat rows above sheep-shorn grass are running at about three-quarters of their peak capacity. A few miles west, the giant chimney of the Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal-fired power station is pumping smoke into the sky. \"It's a nice contrast between the new and the old,\" says Jonathan Selwyn, chief executive of Lark Energy, which developed the solar farm on a disused second world war airfield at Wymeswold in Leicestershire. The panels sit between the old runways, now used as racetracks, and were erected in just seven weeks in the spring. At the Packe Arms, busy with Christmas lunchers, landlady Hilary Holmes is unfazed by the 60-hectare (150-acre) solar farm, the edge of which sits 250 metres from the pub door. \"Is it built already?\" she says. In nearby Wymeswold, Howard Cox, who runs the village hall, is similarly unperturbed: \"If anything there's been a benefit in deflecting the sound of the cars on the race track. More people complain about the chicken farm at the other end of the village, which smells on a hot day.\" Solar farms, each with thousands of panels, are popping up all over the country and now number 250. Costs have halved in two years and are still falling fast – on track to be cheaper than both onshore wind and nuclear power within a few years – and solar is by far the public's most popular energy technology. At Wymeswold, the sheep are said to fatten up quicker in the shelter of the panels, while elsewhere wild flowers feed bees and wildlife scurries back and forth through gaps under the fences. The Wymeswold solar farm, at 33MW capacity, will be overtaken by a series of bigger farms: 40MW at the Science Museum's big object store in Wiltshire, 41MW that started construction last week on low-grade farmland in Oxfordshire and a 90-hectare, 50MW farm proposed by Good Energy at another disused airfield in Norfolk. But the burgeoning industry has seen its sparkle dulled by a series of recent attacks from Conservative ministers, with planning supremo Eric Pickles overturning permission for another old airfield solar farm at Ellough in Suffolk, Greg Barker at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) signalling a crackdown on \"monster solar farms\", and his colleague Michael Fallon deriding subsidies for large solar farms as immoral. \"It's very frustrating,\" says Selwyn. \"The government is making its whole policy based on just a few controversial and badly sited projects.\" He says there was not a single planning objection to the Wymeswold farm and, until Ellough, Lark Energy's success rate in getting planning approval was 100%. As for critics, Selwyn says, those who claim glinting solar panels will blind their views forget that solar panels absorb light, not reflect it, while he argues that the £3.75m the solar farm earns each year in electricity sales and subsidy is a fair return on the £35m capital cost. Ray Noble, co-chair of Decc's solar strategy board, says: \"If we put the solar farms on flat fields, low-grade land, away from houses and roads and get the screening right, no-one knows they are there. I reckon 85% are like that but a few overseas companies saw the opportunity and came in and put farms next to homes and on hills and that is what hit the press.\" The 700MW capacity of solar farms will have doubled by March 2014, he says, and there's three times more again in the pipeline, all of which are required to meet Barker's ambition for 20,000MW of solar by 2020. If achieved, that capacity would generate as much electricity as two or three nuclear power stations. But Barker, a resolute supporter of renewable energy, is unrepentant about his \"monster\" put-down. \"It is because I care passionately about solar and have such high ambitions for it that I do not want public opinion to turn against it and make it become the new onshore wind,\" he says. \"Where problems arise, the solar farms are on undulating land and can't be screened, or they disrupt historic landscapes. It really upsets people.\" Claire Norman, at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, says: \"Too often they are inappropriately sited, too large and with no consideration to landscape impact. Also, we cannot afford to take valuable agricultural land out of use by sacrificing it for solar farms, which enjoy very generous taxpayer subsidy.\" Jonathan Scurlock, chief renewable energy adviser at the National Farmers Union, disagrees: \"They are not any kind of threat to agricultural land, because they allow dual use: either biodiversity, which is increasingly required, or livestock grazing … this diversification can be really important in making the business sustainable.\" A solar farm arrived this month on the doorstep of David Cameron, with Solar Century's 13MW project near Eynsham in his Oxfordshire constituency. It attracted only one planning objection. \"Our experience with local communities is very much the opposite of the negative solar farm stereotype presented by some Conservative ministers and parts of the media,\" says Solar Century's chairman, Jeremy Leggett. \"It's ironic we are having this discussion just as Decc has confirmed half the country may be opened up for fracking. Now there's a technology that really is seeking to industrialise England's beautiful countryside.\" Barker concedes: \"There is a role for large solar parks, but I do not want to see a proliferation or a laissez-faire approach.\" For him, the big opportunity is on the roofs of commercial and industrial building: putting solar on just 16% of all such buildings would deliver the 20,000MW, he says. Barker also notes the huge growth in UK solar capacity, from virtually nothing in 2010 to 3,000MW in 2013. While solar farms have good economies of scale, Leonie Green, at the Solar Trade Association, says large roof installation make good economic sense too, because the solar power used on site can replace electricity bought at the retail price, rather than exported to the grid for the wholesale price. \"But this 'mid-scale' solar is falling through a policy hole,\" she says, because of the legal and technical difficulties. Barker agrees and is already working on solutions as \"a priority\". Noble, a solar industry veteran once at BP solar, says: \"Yes, there are an awful lot of roofs, but it is a very hard market to move\" because of the legal complexities of commercial roof ownership and building rules. He says all forms of solar technology will be needed to hit 20,000MW by 2020 and reckons a third will need to come from panels on home roofs - 500,000 houses already have them - a third from mid-scale and a third from solar farms. The underlying reason for the latest attacks on the latter is clear, he says: \"It is purely political. There are too many Conservative MPs worried about winning their seats at the next election, so when there is a local fuss they want to be seen to take action.\" Back at Wymeswold, Selwyn, whose company has already installed solar on 150 commercial roofs and 600 social housing homes, remains certain about the popularity of well-sited solar farms. \"Government policy seems to be running directly against public sentiment,\" he says. \"And what I don't understand is that the people behind these solar farm projects, the farmers and landowners, are the Conservatives' natural allies.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/finance-nature-no-value-natural-capital","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-31T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"How can the value of nature be embedded in the world of business?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/finance-nature-no-value-natural-capital","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/finance-nature-no-value-natural-capital","fields":{"headline":"How can the value of nature be embedded in the world of business?","bodyText":"Natural capital is a new class of business risk that is often overlooked. It is measured in terms of the structure and function of ecological systems. For example, wetlands buffering coastlines from storms, forests sequestering carbon and enabling natural filtration of water as well as the recharging of underground aquifers. A former banker at Deutsche Bank, Pavan Sukhdev, has been drawing attention to the importance of natural capital for years, since leading The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) study and reports. Natural capital is simple. The value of well-functioning natural systems is clearly manifest to all people and companies – in the form of clean air, reliable availability of freshwater and productive topsoil in which to grow food, among other benefits. Yet, the way that finance works – from GDP calculations through corporate to accounting – it is as if reliable flows from well-functioning natural systems have no value. And so, pollution associated with business operations are only additions to the balance sheet in the form of revenues earned from manufacturing and selling goods. Clearly, the value of nature is not zero. But, what is it? And how can this value be embedded into the number crunching world that is business? A few pathways are emerging to help companies, investors and insurers, among others, factor natural capital into business decision-making processes. 1. Environmental profit &amp; loss (EP&amp;L) and corporate accounting approaches In addition to Puma's development of an EP&amp;L statement, Puma's parent company Kering is applying enhanced EP&amp;L methodology across all its brands (including Gucci, Stella McCartney and Volcom). Novo Nordisk recently released its own EP&amp;L. The Dow Chemical Company is assessing \"nature's value to a company\" and teamed up with Royal Dutch Shell and Swiss Re to examine the business case for \"green infrastructure\". 2. The Investment Risk Pathway Bankers and investors are beginning to explore a different approach to get at similar issues. It is based on risk exposure, or more specifically what we at BSR describe as \"ecosystem malfunction risk\". Considering this new risk begins by asking whether a company's reliance on particular key inputs into the business can be reliably provided by natural systems over time, as well as its impacts associated with operations that may alter, and undercut, ecosystems. For example, for utilities with hydropower facilities, illustrative questions include: will rainfall be sufficient in an era of climate change to keep turbines of hydropower plants above water, or not, as has been the case in Ghana? For companies that rely on ocean water to cool facilities: will ocean temperatures be within the specified range to cool facilities, such as nuclear power plants? Or will they rise during hot summer months above that range, thereby forcing facilities offline until water temperatures are back within range, as has occurred in recent years? For companies reliant upon water from underground aquifers: will underground aquifers \"recharge\", or re-fill, at rates needed to satisfy the demands of all businesses as well as residential users, or might your company be operating in an area that faces groundwater depletion? For agricultural, food and beverage companies: will bees and other natural pollinators be around and available to pollinate apples, almonds, and other crops, or will we face more bee colony collapses with effects on agriculture? The questions go on. While both approaches have merits, it can be challenging to agree upon the monetary values of nature. Hence, the considerable (and diverse) array of analytical tools and approaches, as laid out in a recent BSR working paper. This situation is the rationale for the new Natural Capital Coalition initiative, which focuses on a harmonised approach to valuation. In the interim, until such a clear, credible approach is created, validated and verified, there is a way forward that does not require placing a monetary value on a Siberian tiger, a tiger shark, a wetland, or a mangrove. Rather, corporate decision-makers can assess the magnitude of risk, particularly when viewed in terms of importance to the business as well as cost of avoidance or mitigation actions. For example, the Hyogo framework offers guidance on disaster risk preparation, including related environmental factors, such as climate change and water scarcity. It is time to reconsider risk protocols to include consideration of natural capital, including unintended effects to businesses associated with biodiversity loss and changes in the flow of ecosystem services. Valuing nature in business decision-making processes does not need to be slowed by the lack of clarity on the \"price\" of elements within nature (though ongoing work is seeking to address that issue), but can be acted upon immediately within a magnitude of risk to business approach.

First, a walk along the concrete trough of a London canal, where Brittany Howard – the 26-year-old frontwoman of that brilliant rock band Alabama Shakes – reads aloud the prim names of the houseboats, dodges cyclists passing at speed, and observes the many tossed and floating bottles of Lucozade. She bends to chat to a moorhen. “Hey, little guy. Want a cigarette?” In a canalside pub she drinks her first-ever pint of English ale (“Nutty!”) and then, right away, her second. When she’d pictured this country as a little kid, Howard tells me, it had looked like a set from the Austin Powers films, a land crisscrossed by Carnaby Streets, with wacky cars. As if in answer to this, the pub’s jukebox whirs to life and blares out a jazzy 60s number. “With songs like this playing everywhere!” she says. Alabama Shakes are about to release their second album, Sound &amp; Color, a follow-up to Boys &amp; Girls, their irresistible 2012 debut. Boys &amp; Girls upturned the lives of Howard, guitarist Heath Fogg, bassist Zac Cockrell and drummer Steve Johnson. Before that, they were another dressed-down rock-and-blues band in their hometown of Athens, Alabama, not above doing covers in a local venue called Yesterdays, or afternooning at old people’s homes. Then one of their songs, the brash, catchy Hold On, became an online and radio hit. Their debut LP sold a surprise half a million, all of this hauling them out of Alabama and sending them… well, everywhere else. They gigged in front of millions on Saturday Night Live and toured the US, Europe and Australia. They were a star turn of the UK festival season in 2012 then played at the Grammys in 2013, where they were nominated in three categories. Apart from a short break last year, for Howard to write songs for the new record at her kitchen table, and for Fogg and Johnson to tend to newborn kids, Alabama Shakes have been “road-dogging” ever since their breakthrough. It’s Howard’s phrase. “Road, road, road,” she explains, “then a few days back home to sleep, then road, road, road.” When you’ve become popular by being very definitely from a place (and Alabama Shakes are very definitely from Athens, Alabama; the music they make channels the bluesy sound that has defined the region’s output since the days of Aretha), the challenge is to carry that sense of place through all the other places that popularity takes you. How to summon some authentic “heart of Dixie” in front of lagered-up campers in Perthshire, as the band will do when they travel to T in the Park this summer? Or on stage at the White House, where they played for the Obamas two years ago? It’s something they think about a lot. They still dress down to perform, usually wandering on stage in hoodies and home-wear, something that can be read as affectation. But it’s an honest effort, I think, to retain a sense of themselves as the underdog band they once were. Gigging at Islington Assembly Hall in February (the night before I meet them, the venue just a few turns up the canal), this quartet slunk out and picked up their instruments as if they were still jobbers who hardly expected to be listened to, not headliners for whom everyone in the room had paid £40 to see. What else? Howard has a charm-like tattoo on her arm – a thin line tracing the shape of Alabama’s borders. “So that I could die in London or Paris or wherever,” she says, “and when they’re wrapping up and cleaning my body they’re gonna know.” We’re outside the pub again, to escape the jazzy 60s music, and so Howard can smoke. “I never thought I’d be a singer when I started this habit,” she says, frowning at her cigarette. “I was 15. Ugh.” She is tall, bespectacled, wrapped in an oversize leather coat she calls her “Trading Places jacket. In that movie everybody was wearing shit like this. Look at the sleeves!” Back in 2012, she had lots of wild curls, but the hair, now, has been buzzed into a compact wedge. It started falling out in the studio, she says, after a botched effort at straightening it. Howard is mixed race, inheriting from her African-American father a frizz that will fight to the death against being chemically messed with. She is stocky. Without my prompting she alludes to being on a diet more than once. I bring this up because Howard does, though I have definite reservations. Nobody ever asks Jay-Z to account for his height, Chris Martin his skinniness. Howard’s shape, like her thick-rimmed specs, like her being “the only rock’n’roll brown chick”, as she once put it, all help to make her an unusual and intriguing frontwoman. But most of her appeal, trumping even that tremendous, cig-roughened voice, lies in her habit of going absolutely bananas on stage. Lit by devil-red spots, Howard will fold herself over her guitar, riffing, howling, as if in critical pain. “I call it ‘the spirit world’,” she says, when I ask where she goes in these moments. “Latching on to a feeling, riding it, trying not to come out of it. You stop thinking, you’re just performing – that’s the spirit world.” She isn’t much of a one for microphone patter. “Sometimes between songs I have nothing to say. It’s not because I’m not appreciative of the applause, the love. I’m just still on it, and I’m trying to keep on it.” As a woman fronting a band, she says, “you’re expected to be a darling up there. Like, ‘Look at that sweet little thing! Singing her songs about lurve.’” Howard shoots me a look: nope. “I’m a human being,” she says. Are none of the songs about love? I’m thinking about the title track from the first album, a plea for a friendship to evolve into something more, or a great song on the new album called Miss You, with its ear-worm lyric: “I’m gonna miss you/ And your Mickey Mouse tattoo.” Howard says they’re stories, thoughts, imaginings, overheard things,half-truths. She scrolls through some lyrics on her iPhone. This is how she writes, she says, tapping in random phrases whenever they come to her. One lyric was written, I can see, just after midnight a few days earlier. It reads: “I can’t have you for ever/ But I can try.” This seems a preoccupation of Howard’s, not only wanting something but wanting it indefinitely. I ask if she’s in a relationship right now. “Uh, yes.” Is it new? “Relatively.” Does it look like it’ll last? “Mm-hm.” And that does it for the boyfriend/girlfriend portion of the chat. Howard will flit engagingly between topics, from American politicians (“Lip-flappers”) to the Ferguson riots (“Long time comin’”), from her obsession with an old Nintendo game, The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time (“Completed it several times”), to her ill-timed meeting with Adele, backstage at the Grammys, when Howard was wearing only pants (“Spanx, actually”). But she isn’t interview putty. She won’t discuss what she doesn’t want to, and closes off avenues. At one point, we drift on to the subject of ghosts. Howard checks for them, she insists, in any new home before she moves in. When I ask if she really believes in ghosts she says she does. When I ask why, she’s quiet for a time before saying: “Uh, nah. Let’s just… keep the conversation moving. Let’s not talk about ghosts.” Reading about her life, I know that when Howard was a young girl her sister, then 13, died from cancer. The funeral announcement, utterly miserable, still comes up online when you search Howard’s name. “I can’t have you for ever/ But I can try.” This stuff isn’t always about love – or the lurve kind of love – I suppose. ***** Walking along the canal again, Howard talks about her parents. “Really different from each other. My dad’s social, charismatic, knows how to do a lot with a little. My mom’s more responsible. She pretty much gave me my work ethic. You know, ‘Don’t quit your job until you have another, however much you hate it.’ I’m driven because of my mom.” They were not together when Howard was growing up. “My mom worked really hard to make sure I had things I needed. But sometimes it was tight.” She was 13, out of a pre-teen obsession with the pop group Hanson, newly a fan of grownup stuff such as The Dark Side of the Moon, when she set about turning herself in to a musician. She taught herself the guitar and spent hours alone in her bedroom with a midi keyboard and a computer. Ten hours at a stretch, sometimes, just writing. It isn’t hard to imagine this being a method of coping with grief. At school she met her future bassist, Zac Cockrell, in a psychology class. Cockrell tells me he remembers them first chatting over a Monopoly board, which they were meant to play as part of some busy-work experiment. The pair became friends and started jamming together, fleshing out Howard’s songs. It helped fill the time. “I hated high school,” Howard says. “I was bored.” Steve Johnson, a local in town, was recruited as a drummer after they’d graduated. Heath Fogg was last aboard, initially part of a rival band and switching teams because of the prospect of collaborating with Howard, who was showing signs of having some serious, industry-ready pipes. By 2009, they were called the Shakes, booked for shows but still very much part-time. Cockrell worked at an animal clinic and Johnson at a nuclear power station. Howard was a chef at a steak restaurant. “Miserable,” she says, miming for me some glum spatula work, turning ribeyes. “Work, work, work – just to give your money to the utility company. Every day I went in thinking: ‘Fuck this place.’” She later became a postal worker, which was better. “But I was only having a good time when I was playing. I remember this little bar called the Brick…” Online, I found some social media posts from this period of their lives. There will be sweat, the band write of a show at the Brick. There will be uncontrollable toe tappin… WE WILL BE COMING FOR THEM BRAINS. “Yeah I wrote that,” smiles Howard, tickled. She hasn’t thought about this for a while. They once put out a request on Facebook, asking people to suggest a new name because there was already a group called the Shakes in Philadelphia. The ideas that came back in were mixed. “The Shooks?… The Sweats?... Believe it or not, the Spasms hasn’t yet been taken… Milkwagon?… Thrashing Megalodon?… Boxcar Children?…” Someone at music blog the South Rail suggested the Alabama Shakes. Howard replied: “Yeaaah!” Another blog, Aquarium Drunkard, praised one of their songs and provided a link, a small kindness that proved enormous. Through the blog, the track was heard by Patterson Hood, frontman of the highly regarded alt-country band Drive-By Truckers. He helped set the band up with their managers, Christine Stauder and Kevin Morris, and also arranged for the Shakes to open for the Drive-By Truckers when they toured. “The Truckers were my heroes!” says Fogg, who thought this support-slot booking a pinnacle moment. Ambition met. Retire happy. But after their tour finished, Fogg recalls, “everything kept going – at, like, a super-fast rate”. Jack White became an admirer, and they duetted with Mavis Staples. Mercedes opened its chequebook and persuaded the band to soundtrack an advert. This summer, Alabama Shakes will play at a festival in Colorado, where Drive-By Truckers will open for them. ***** Brittany Howard is funny. Catch-you-out, snort-into-your-glass-of-nutty-beer funny. She might suddenly assume a character – for instance, a misogynistic Alabaman, sweetly amazed that a woman can “even play the guitar good”. Her phrasing is always inventive and back in the band’s early days she originated an enormous roster of names for the improvised dance moves she’d perform on stage: the Reverse Raindance, the Matador, the One-Legged Foxtrot, the Pre-Apocalyptic Strut (completely different, she insists, from the Post-Apocalyptic Strut), the Full Body Seizure. When Howard tells a story it never quite progresses in a way you’d expect. She starts talking about an upsetting time not long after the release of the band’s first album. Howard was visiting Nashville when she was robbed at gunpoint. “Out of the corner of my eye I see these two dudes coming towards us in a combat-running position… I just thought, ‘Please don’t let anyone get shot.’” Afterwards, shaken up, she drove back to Athens. “I had to pull over a few times I was so freaked out. When I got back I went straight to my best friend’s house. I said, ‘I just got robbed!’ He said, ‘Oh my God!’ I said, ‘Will you come with me to buy a vacuum cleaner?’” Wait. What? “I just felt like I really needed a vacuum cleaner,” says Howard. “So we went to Walmart and I got an off-brand Dust Devil. And you know what? It made me feel better.” Voices, made-up dance moves, stories with a sort of low-horizon good cheer: this is one way the band bring Alabama with them on tour. At my request, Howard demonstrates the One-Legged Foxtrot. She spreads her arms and does a deliberately awkward hop, upsetting the moorhens, her Trading Places jacket billowing in the wind. She’s brilliant. When we walk on she talks about the best friend, the one who went vacuum cleaner shopping with her that day. He was the band’s first drummer, says Howard, booted out and replaced a long time ago for not showing up at enough rehearsals. They used to tell each other as kids: “‘We gotta get out of this town! We gotta get out of this town!’ It was all I would talk about,” says Howard. “Well, I did get out. Here I am.” And the friend? She shakes her head. “It’s OK. He’s doing what he needs to be doing. I’m doing what I need to be doing. But every time I hang out with him I’m like, ‘Man, I just wish you were there’.” She means: there with her in front of the president, on primetime telly, at festivals in Ireland, Italy, Holland, Scotland. Hauling their act around, “taking a hobby and turning it into a profession”, as Fogg puts it, has tested Alabama Shakes’ sense of who they are and where they come from. But it has also shown them the world. Broadened them. Paid. In something of a creative departure, Howard has written a song for the new album about global warfare. Don’t Wanna Fight was inspired by “people killing each other because of ridiculous assumptions. Are you a Shiite? Are you a Jew? I’ve started paying attention to things like that.” Back in Athens she’s been able to move out of the trailer she lived in for years, and into her own house. “I remember waking up for the first time there. And it was quiet. And safe. And mine. And I knew where my pots and pans were!” Last year, she treated her mum and grandma to a blow-out Hawaiian holiday, which included a helicopter flight over a volcano. Growing up, I ask, were these things she had reasonable expectations of? “Oh, of course not. I didn’t know what I’d do. Ask my parents! But they were like, ‘Well, we’ll let Brittany figure it out…’ I figured it out.” She figured it out. We both do a One-Legged Foxtrot, there on the towpath, to celebrate. Alabama Shakes play the Great Escape festival, Brighton, on 15 May, and T in the Park, Strathallan Castle, Perthshire, on 12 July.

Newspaper headlines from Moscow to Washington and Sydney to Kiev all agree: the cold war is back. Well, maybe. Escalating tensions between President Vladimir Putin’s Russia and western countries led by the US are certainly reminiscent of the bad old days in some significant respects. The cold war, a truly global stand-off of immense ideological, military and political import, began, roughly, in the late 1940s and continued until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, an event later deplored by Putin as the biggest tragedy of the 20th century. But this time around, the battleground is less extensive, the battle-lines less clear. The particular trigger for the resurgence of chronic cold war-itis was Russia’s sudden annexation in March of Crimea, a Black Sea region that Moscow, historically speaking, regards as its own. It is, in fact, part of the sovereign territory of independent Ukraine. Since then, the trouble has spread, with Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine fighting for independence, or at least autonomy, from the western-backed government in Kiev, and Russia implicitly threatening western energy supplies. Last weekend’s G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, showed just how raw nerves have become – over Ukraine and, more broadly, over what the west has come to see as a pattern of expansionist, confrontational and often illegal behaviour by the Putin regime, including its not-forgotten 2008 military intervention in Georgia. On meeting Putin, Canada’s prime minister, Stephen Harper, said: “Well, I guess I’ll shake your hand but I have only one thing to say to you: you need to get out of Ukraine.” David Cameron and Barack Obama personally delivered similar messages, in slightly less hostile terms. Putin left the summit early, in a huff, but showed no sign whatever of backing down. Later, in an interview on German television, he complained that western countries, not him, were pushing the world towards a new cold war. Putin repeated his old grievance that the extension of Nato membership in central and eastern Europe since 1991 had been a “geopolitical game changer” to which Russia was forced to respond. That response included resumed long-range strategic bomber flights, to counter similar US activities around Russia’s periphery, he said. “Nato and the United States have military bases scattered all over the globe, including in areas close to our borders, and their number is growing,” Putin said. “Moreover, just recently it was decided to deploy special operations forces, again in close proximity to our borders [a reference to Nato exercises in the Baltic states]. You have mentioned various [Russian] exercises, flights, ship movements and so on. Is all of this going on? Yes, it is indeed,” Putin said. Putin was also referring to Russia’s recent tit-for-tat expulsion of Polish and German diplomats for alleged spying, another apparent throwback to the cold war era of furtive espionage, John le Carré’s Smiley thrillers, and the very real depredations of Philby, Burgess and Maclean. Putin’s invocation of the cold war was nothing new. It may be that, like many Russians and more than a few western generals, he actually misses it. Earlier this month, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, reviled by the nationalist rightwing forces around Putin for presiding over the Soviet breakup, issued a similar warning. “We must make sure that we get the tensions that have arisen recently under control,” Gorbachev said. But to the dismay of his admirers in the west, he went on to claim that Ukraine was being used as an excuse by the US to victimise Russia and declared his backing for Putin. “I am absolutely convinced that Putin protects Russia’s interests better than anyone else,” he said. Auguries of a rising confrontation between Russia and the west are not hard to find. A recent report by the European Leadership Network said close military encounters have jumped to cold war levels, with 40 dangerous or sensitive incidents recorded in the past eight months. Sweden recently launched a full-scale naval operation to hunt down a mini-submarine, assumed to be Russian, trespassing inside its coastal waters. The hunt was eventually called off after nothing was found. Analysts suggested that was just as well, since the depth-charging of a Russian sub, if it had happened (and the Swedes were angry enough to do it), could have sparked a bigger crisis. Other governments in the Baltic region have similar worries. In August, Finland scrambled US-made Hornet fighter jets when Russian aircraft illegally entered Finnish airspace on three separate occasions in one week. A Finnish research vessel was also harassed. In an interview with the Guardian, Sauli Niinisto, Finland’s president, added his voice to the chorus warning that the world was “at the gates of a new kind of cold war”. But the similarities can be overdone, a senior government insider in Helsinki said, arguing that Russia is economically weak, deprived of foreign investment, beset by capital flight, and almost wholly dependent for cash on energy exports at a time when the international oil price is dropping. “Russia’s actions in Ukraine are more a show of weakness and fear. This is not expansionism, this is insecurity,” the insider said. On the other hand, if backed into a corner, Putin might prove to be an unpredictable opponent. “Putin is no Gorbachev; he is not a guy who is going to give up. He will not go quietly. Remember, this is a global nuclear power we are talking about,” he continued. Any new cold war-type confrontation would differ in scope and range from the worldwide frozen conflict that dominated the latter half of the 20th century. For a start, it would not be truly global. In the 1970s and 80s, countries as diverse as Nicaragua, Angola, Yemen and Indonesia were the setting for proxy wars fought between rival Soviet or Cuban-backed forces on the one hand, and western-backed, anti-communist militias on the other. These conflicts often centred on movements for post-colonial independence, or in South Africa, freedom from apartheid. The second decade of the 21st century offers little scope for a repetition. Following the Soviet implosion, the Warsaw Pact (Russia’s Nato equivalent) was wound up. Moscow now has few friends in eastern and central Europe. In the wider world, Russia’s lack of overt allies is now even more evident. Developing countries such as Nigeria, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and Mexico have no need or wish for Moscow’s political or military backing. As the world’s largest democracy, India looks askance at Russia’s authoritarian system. For its part, China sees Russia primarily as a source of cheap energy and raw materials. As Beijing’s power and influence grows, Russia (like Japan) is more likely to be a future adversary than an ally in a global contest with the west. Similar considerations apply on the western “side”. When the cold war finished, the US declared itself the victor, paid itself a peace dividend in the form of reduced military spending, and flattered itself that, with the end of superpower rivalry, a unipolar moment had arrived – meaning unchallenged US global hegemony. A quarter of a century later, that smug self-congratulation has disappeared, as has much international confidence in US leadership. As the G20 summit demonstrated, countries such as Brazil have no more interest in following the US lead on Russia than, for example, on national security and privacy laws, the subject of angry exchanges following the Snowden revelations about illegal NSA wire-taps in Latin America. In other words, if the US and Russia want a fight, they will each have far fewer supporters this time around. Indeed, China and the other 21st-century powers may well welcome the idea of the “old” superpowers wearing themselves out in a new slug-fest. A new cold war would lack other key features that distinguished its forerunner. Ideologically speaking, the once definitive struggle between the monolithic rival systems of Marxist communism and free-market capitalism has largely evaporated for want of interest. It has been replaced by a contest of values, such as fair and open elections, respect for human rights, freedom of expression and movement, religious tolerance and the rule of law, as championed by the US and its west-European allies; and a system of managed democracy, oligarchic governance and limits on individual liberty in exchange for supposed economic benefits, as practised in Putin’s Russia, one-party China, and other emerging states. Likewise, some the worst excesses of the cold war period, such as the multi-billion-dollar arms races in nuclear and conventional weaponry, are now largely absent. Putin has increased spending on Russia’s nuclear and other arsenals, and the US still maintains a powerful strategic nuclear force. But the strategic arms reduction treaties have significantly reduced warheads and missiles on both sides. The paranoid days typified by Dr Strangelove and the nightmare doctrines of MAD (mutual assured destruction) seem unlikely to return. Looked at another way, it could be argued the cold war never went away, or at least, that there was merely a brief time-out in the 1990s that ended when Putin rose to power 15 years ago. Bilateral proxy contests for power and influence have continued, though in different forms. In Syria, Moscow’s strong support for the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which rents Russia a military base at Tartus on the Mediterranean, is one of the main reasons Assad has survived the civil war for as long as he has. In supporting Assad, Russia acts in deliberate, intransigent opposition to the US. In Iran, similarly, Russia has worked to maintain close ties with the ruling clerical establishment, in open defiance of US and Israeli-led efforts to isolate the ayatollahs. Moscow is a party to the Vienna negotiations on Iran’s suspect nuclear programme, which are due to conclude next Monday. But at the same time, it has announced a new deal to build next-generation nuclear reactors at two sites in Iran, regardless of the outcome in Vienna. Spying, information theft, economic espionage and assassination also remain an important part of the dysfunctional US-Russia relationship. To crude violence have now been added the new weapons of the information age, including identity theft, cyber-warfare, computer hacking and ever more sophisticated disinformation techniques. Russia may not have changed that much since the Soviet days, but in terms of propaganda, disseminated through slick, sanitised media outlets, it has raised its game significantly. Yet, more than anything else perhaps, the stridently toxic personality of Vladimir Putin himself fits well in the “new cold war” scenario. Like the Soviet hardmen of old, such as Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, and Yuri Andropov, the diminutive Putin appears by turns ruthless, charming and ultimately reckless. His passionate, single-minded belief in his nation’s greatness, owing as much to the Tsarist as to the Soviet legacy, drives his mission to project Russian power. His ability to ignore moral considerations, legal norms, and basic human compassion makes him both a dangerous and resourceful foe. Since he first unexpectedly came to power as prime minister in 1999, western politicians, diplomats and generals have been asking the question: who is Vladimir Putin? Now they may have the answer. He is the man who put the cold war back in vogue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2014/jun/09/rik-mayall","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-09T19:01:50Z","webTitle":"Rik Mayall obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/09/rik-mayall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/09/rik-mayall","fields":{"headline":"Rik Mayall obituary","bodyText":"Rik Mayall, who has died suddenly aged 56, was a phenomenal and outrageous performer, a leading light of the \"alternative\" comedy circuit that emerged from the Comedy Store in the 1980s, and a not inconsiderable comic actor, playing in Beckett and Simon Gray on the West End stage and in Gogol at the National Theatre. Part of his success lay in the timing. His crude persona Rick in the breakthrough television series The Young Ones (1982-84), written with Ben Elton and Lise Mayer, was a gimlet-eyed, nose-picking lunatic who nonetheless carried a terrible plausibility as a prissy radical student of the day. Long gone were the serious political protests and scabrous, intelligent revues of the 60s student generation; here, student life was parodied as grotty and anarchic, with Mayall surrounded by Ade Edmondson as Vyvyan, a crypto-Nazi, Nigel Planer as Neil, a cartoon, out-of-date hippie in a haze and Christopher Ryan as Mike, a miniature smoothie; a bunch of total prats, in fact. Mayall even lived this role off-stage, telling an interviewer (half-seriously, no doubt) that he threw his satchel in the Severn on the day he heard he had got a place at Manchester University and resolved never to read a book again. Television, and its audiences, was just ready for this sort of onslaught and Mayall and Edmondson – the two met at Manchester and remained longterm writing and performing partners – scored a major popular success, too, with Filthy Rich and Catflap (1987), written by Elton, alongside Planer; and again in Bottom (1991-95), which ran for three series but also became a fixture of the touring circuit in the live show version. Mayall had another television hit as the cheating, monstrous Tory MP Alan B'stard in The New Statesman (1987-92), written by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, an irresistibly grotesque performance (for which he won a Bafta award), later transforming B'Stard into a New Labour convert in another touring stage show, The Blair B'Stard Project. After a brief appearance in the first series of Blackadder in 1983 as Mad Gerald, he returned as the boisterous adventurer Lord Flashheart, full of sexual innuendo and flirting with Queenie, in Blackadder II (1986); then, with the same name, as a first world war flying ace in Blackadder Goes Forth (1989). In 1998, he sustained a fractured skull after crashing a quad bike into a concrete wall on his farm in East Allington, south Devon. He was \"technically dead\" for five days, but made a good recovery, allegedly saying to the first doctor he saw as he came round: \"So, you're the bastard who keeps sticking needles into me.\" Mayall, born in Harlow, Essex, was the second of four children of John and Gillian Mayall, both drama teachers, and grew up in Droitwich, Worcestershire. At the age of eight, he played a peasant in Brecht's The Good Woman of Setzuan and pulled faces when told not to sing (because he couldn't) in the school choir, aged 10; he soon knew what he wanted to do when he didn't grow up. He was educated at the King's school, Worcester, and took a degree in drama at Manchester, where he formed a comedy partnership with Edmondson that became known on the circuit as the Dangerous Brothers, then Twentieth Century Coyote. A lot of their comedy was in reaction to Margaret Thatcher, or \"Thatch\" as Elton, their fellow Manchester student, dubbed her, but a lot of it was sheer high-energy nonsense and gooning about. Mayall and Edmondson wrote a very short play, The Wart (1979), in response to Ken Campbell's 24-hour epic, The Warp, which prompted the critic James Fenton to hail Mayall as \"a talented maniac\". After the madness of his TV success, he joined the National Theatre in 1985 to play the deluded lead character in Gogol's The Government Inspector, duping a small town and its mayor, played by Jim Broadbent. This performance, wildly energetic though it was, I found distinctly unfunny; he was much better, two years later, in the West End, as Vladimir in Beckett's Waiting for Godot, with Edmondson as Estragon, in a surprisingly tender and melancholic revival directed by Les Blair and designed by Derek Jarman. He had established a rapport with the playwright Gray in a revival of The Common Pursuit (he played a would-be theatre critic lapsing into glossy high-end journalism and lung cancer) and followed through in Gray's Cell Mates (1991) at the Albery (now the Noël Coward) as the Irish petty criminal, Sean Bourke, who befriends the spy George Blake in prison; Blake was played by Stephen Fry, who defected when the reviews came out. Mayall received far worse notices for several films: Edmondson's Guest House Paradiso (1999), in which the pair of them played sociopaths running a horrid hotel near a nuclear power plant; John Henderson's Bring Me the Head of Mavis Davis (1997), in which Mayall played a vile record producer realising that his protege, sung by Jane Horrocks, would be more valuable to him dead; and his turn as Peeves the Poltergeist in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001), which hit the deck in the editing suite. And there was one disastrous excursion to Hollywood in Ate de Jong's Drop Dead Fred (1991), a high-energy low comedy about a grown woman (Phoebe Cates) revisited by the imaginary friend of her childhood (Mayall) on a mission to cheer her up. He only made things worse. But Mayall bounced back from this into Bottom and, in 2005, published a spoof, Alan Partridge-style autobiography, Bigger than Hitler, Better than Christ, and also made a surprisingly \"soft\" TV series, All About George, written by Cold Feet author Mike Bullen, charting his struggle to keep up with the rigours of family life; being nice in this show was a professional first. Mayall married the make-up artist Barbara Robbin in 1985, and is survived by her and their three children, Rosie, Sidney and Bonnie. • Richard Michael Mayall, comedian and writer, born 7 March 1958; died 9 June 2014 • This article was amended on 10 June 2014.

Yes, I would say. The question is whether it is likely. So an analysis published on Friday which sets out how to make the global nuclear power industry safe is important, not least because it is written by neither industry-linked figures or green campaigners. It is in one of the world's top scientific journals, Science, and written by two heavyweights with decades of experience, both at Harvard University: Matt Bunn, and Olli Heinonen, who spent 27 years at the International Atomic Energy Agency including five years as Deputy Director General. I'll run through the paper in a bit of detail (as it is behind a paywall). The pair start by saying the Fukushima disaster in Japan \"revealed technical and institutional weaknesses that must be fixed around the world. If nuclear power is to grow on the scale required to be a significant part of the solution to global climate disruption or scarcity of fossil fuels, major steps are needed to rebuild confidence that nuclear facilities will be safe from accidents and secure against attacks.\" \"Will Fukushima lead to new action to strengthen the global nuclear safety and security system?\" they ask. \"So far, the signs are not promising.\" They acknowledge that new reactor designs with automatic safety features may reduce risks, but say: \"For the next few decades, most nuclear energy will be generated by the hundreds of reactors that already exist and those that will be built with existing designs. Hence, the near-term focus should be on upgrading safety and security for existing and planned facilities and building institutional approaches that can find and fix the facilities that pose the highest risks.\" They propose actions in six areas. 1. Higher safety standards. Following Fukushima, where the earthquake and tsunami were both larger than the \"design basis\" of the plants, all regulators must reassess whether the design bases reflect plausible risks and must require operators to plan for events beyond design bases. Problems exposed in Fukushima of gas build up and loss of cooling water must be solved around the world. Regulators must be wholly independent and have the authority and resources to be effective. 2. Higher security standards. \"There is a need for more stringent standards for protecting nuclear facilities against terrorist sabotage—a step both al Qaeda and Chechen terrorists have considered,\" Bunn and Heinonen write. \"Yet today, security in place at many nuclear sites around the world is weak.\" Security was ignored at the IAEA June ministerial meeting, they write. 3. Stonger emergency response \"The IAEA response to the Fukushima crisis was often too little, too late, in sharp contrast, for example, to the World Health Organization's ability to respond quickly to disease outbreaks ... It needs radical improvement.\" The authors also recommend the creation of an international emergency response team. 4. Strengthened and expanded peer reviews. Every country operating major nuclear facilities should ask for an international team to review its nuclear safety and security arrangements,\" the pair write, noting that \"reviews to check compliance with inadequate standards are not enough\". Reviews by industry body WANO are kept secret while most reactors have never had a more transparent IAEA review. 5. Legally binding requirements International \"treaties governing nuclear safety and security express broad goals but include few specific requirements. States should negotiate specific, binding standards for both safety and security, although this is not likely to happen quickly, given the current lack of consensus reviewed.\" 6. Expanded international cooperation \"The fact that the disaster revealed a range of inadequacies in nuclear safety in Japan, one of the world's wealthiest countries and among those with the longest experience in using nuclear energy, highlights the stringent demands for political and institutional stability, regulatory effectiveness, and sustained organizational excellence that today's nuclear technologies impose. Some nuclear countries, or countries now planning their first plant, struggle with regulatory ineffectiveness, corruption, and political instability.\" They conclude: \"Much now depends on bold leadership from IAEA Director-General Yukiya Amano and the leaders of major states operating and exporting nuclear plants.\" It's a clear-eyed assessment, in my view. If these measures were implemented, I'd be pretty comfortable with the safety and security of nuclear power, although the price tag would be great. But my judgement is they will not be. To be clear, I am absolutely not backing coal, some of the tragic consequences of which are being played out in Wales as I write. I back renewables and efficiency. Making those work at sufficient scale is of course a huge challenge. But making the nuclear industry around the world safe and cost-effective is a greater one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2013/dec/18/uk-infrastructure-plan-industry-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-18T09:00:00Z","webTitle":"UK government's infrastructure plan is a good first step","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2013/dec/18/uk-infrastructure-plan-industry-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2013/dec/18/uk-infrastructure-plan-industry-investment","fields":{"headline":"UK government's infrastructure plan is a good first step","bodyText":"The launch of an updated national infrastructure plan (NIP) at the beginning of December demonstrated that the government has listened to the construction industry's concerns. We are finally seeing real progress being made and, in NIP, the development of a robust strategy around infrastructure and delivery. The most important thing now is that we continue to engage and that government listens and responds to the industry's concerns and advice. This will provide further impetus to carry forward NIP and deliver the projects it contains to ensure the UK can meet future challenges. Already significant progress has been made around projects that can be delivered quickly: 36 transport projects worth £1.6bn have been completed. Steps forward have also been taken in more medium and long-term projects, with deals struck for new nuclear power generation plants at Hinkley Point and Wylfa, and an extension to the Northern Line to Battersea. The 2013 NIP also sees a definitive shift in how government presents the infrastructure case. The project pipeline numbers and timescales have been updated but additional clarity and substance have also been added. A sector-by-sector breakdown of what the UK needs in terms of investment is provided, which highlights how, according to Department for Transport estimates on traffic growth, the cost of congestion could rise to £36bn per year by 2040. In future editions, the Association for Consultancy and Engineering (ACE) would expect to see funding profiles for individual projects also included, but this represents a good first step. The plan also gives greater detail to activity in the regions and devolved nations. This will not only help local authorities and communities to plan, but will allow companies and investors to allocate their resources more effectively. ACE has also long argued that the infrastructure plan should be an investment prospectus that can be used to attract private sector money. The announcement, therefore, of £25bn of investment from the insurance sector is welcome, and gives confidence to other investors. Government must now work to distribute this financing to the most crucial projects, and develop more long-term funding arrangements with private sector sources. Industry will continue to support the chief secretary and commercial secretary in all of their efforts to deliver projects listed in the plan. It is, however, important to carry the hard-won momentum into future projects so we can really upscale the delivery of infrastructure vital to the UK's competitive future.

The discovery of two significant offshore deposits, and prospects for fracking in many areas, have triggered a black-gold rush, with demand for exploration permits up 35% since 2012. A report published this week by Deloitte says the oil industry could create 250,000 jobs and constitute 4.3% of GDP by 2065. The report is based on an estimate of 2bn barrels of oil and 2.5bn cubic metres of gas. The oil companies estimate that the deposits in a series of oilfields off the Canaries, the latest of which was confirmed last week, amount to 500m barrels of crude. Deloitte predicts that Spain could become a gas exporter by 2031 while producing 20% of the oil it consumes. With 6 million people unemployed and an economy that shows only feeble signs of recovery, the Spanish government seems ready to brush aside environmental concerns and give the green light to the oil companies. These are led by the Aberdeen-based oil and gas exploration company Cairn Energy and the Anglo-Turkish firm Genel Energy, headed by the former BP boss Tony Hayward. So far, 70 licences have been granted to explore both shale gas and conventional resources. The main offshore deposits lie between Lanzarote, in the Canary Islands, and Morocco, and in the Bay of Valencia, close to Ibiza. As both the Canaries and Ibiza are places of great natural beauty whose principal industry is tourism, there is intense opposition to the plans. Opposition is so fierce in Ibiza that the Eivissa diu no (Ibiza says no) movement has succeeded in creating a united front across the entire political spectrum, taking in environmental groups and hoteliers, and has won the support of celebrities such as Kate Moss, Sienna Miller, Fatboy Slim and Paris Hilton, who wrote on Instagram: \"Don't let them ruin one of the most beautiful islands in the world.\" The record producer and rapper Puff Daddy described the plans as \"a disaster on every level\". Last month, more than 20,000 people marched in Ibiza (which has a population of 132,000) to oppose the exploration, and thousands signed a petition to the European commission demanding a halt to sonic exploration that was producing 250-decibel booms every 10 seconds, day and night, over a period of three months. As well as breaking the safe limit, of 180 decibels, the booms damage fisheries and bird life, the protesters say. David Sala, a spokesman for the Ibiza says no movement, said: \"Just because we have the technology to exploit nature, we can't continue to use technology that destroys the environment and, by extension, ourselves.\" Paulino Rivero, president of the Canary Islands regional government, wrote to the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, last month telling him that he plans to hold a referendum on the issue, posing the question: \"Do you agree with the oil exploration off the coast of our islands authorised by the multinational Repsol?\" The Spanish government's only response was to remind Rivero that referendums are illegal under the constitution. Antonio Martín, president of the Spanish oil exploration association, said: \"When we talk about exploration and production of hydrocarbons in Spain, we are talking about creating employment [and] wealth for the country and improving our commercial standing in the world.\" Spain depends on imports for 99% of its oil and gas needs. Aside from some coal mines in the north, the country, has never been blessed with energy resources. It has a highly developed hydroelectricity industry – only China and the U.S. have built more dams – and its ageing nuclear power stations meet 20% of demand. Until recently, it was investing heavily in renewables. Wind power now provides 20% of the grid and solar 3%, but the current government has lost its enthusiasm for renewables, and has made drastic cuts in subsidies. The most promising areas for shale gas are in the north, principally the Basque Country, Asturias and Cantabria; the first explorations have begun, in Asturias and Castilla y León. Several regional governments have outlawed fracking but last year the central government used its overall majority to pass legislation that overrules regional administrations on the issue. \"The minister has to defend the interest of Spain as a whole, and the regional presidents have every right to defend their interests,\" said Enrique Hernández Bento, who is minister for both energy and tourism. \"The government will support these explorations as long as they comply with legal and environmental requirements.\" The organisation Shale Gas España says: \"This won't be a panacea that makes Spain self-sufficient.\" But, it says, fracking will allow Spain to be 60% rather than 80% dependent on conventional gas. An independent consumer association says that if enough shale gas is found, the cost to the consumer should fall. This could help offset the high energy prices Spaniards pay as result – the association claims – of the high investment in renewables."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/sep/18/diplomacy-syria-chance-talk-iran","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-18T17:30:00Z","webTitle":"Diplomacy over Syria brings another chance to talk with Iran | Hans Blix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/18/diplomacy-syria-chance-talk-iran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/18/diplomacy-syria-chance-talk-iran","fields":{"headline":"Diplomacy over Syria brings another chance to talk with Iran","bodyText":"For some weeks the world's attention has turned from the brutal civil war that continues to rage over much of Syria, and focused instead on the horrible large-scale use of chemical weapons near Damascus – which has now been verified in a report by UN appointed impartial inspectors. After several bewildering political turns, the framework agreed in Geneva by the foreign ministers of the US and Russia may be viable and meet the interest of their own and many other governments – even though it is bitterly denounced by Syrian rebels, who had hoped for strong US military action, and even though there is no consensus on the question of guilt. Rather than a fast-track, global-police action with the US ignoring the UN security council – and charter – to punish Syria with limited military strikes, we now see Damascus brought on a fast-track to the chemical weapons convention and an accelerated process for those weapons to be declared (within a week), verified by international inspectors and removed from or destroyed in Syria (within the first half of 2014). The executive council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the security council are, quite properly, to run the process and supervise it. This \"framework\" takes the US off a military course that appeared to go against American public opinion, might have been rejected in Congress, and could have led to loss of many lives in Syria and dragged Washington into further armed conflict. Many governments welcomed that, under the framework, the security council is no longer ignored but made the central forum for action and supervision. For Russia, as a permanent council member with a veto, this meant preserved influence. Through the framework, Russia also protected the Syrian government from the loss of military assets that would have been destroyed in punitive strikes. While Moscow reaped praise for preventing armed action, the only price it paid was the destruction of a chemical arsenal that the Syrian government could hardly have used a second time. What now looks almost like an international \"due process\" will undoubtedly raise questions. It seems unlikely the Syrian government will seek to obstruct the process and raise a need for enforcement measures, but troublesome practical and political problems will inevitably arise. The reset that has already taken place between the US and Russia in Geneva will be needed to solve such problems. Even more co-operation will be needed between the two, and within the security council, to tackle the much greater challenge of achieving a ceasefire in Syria and a conference to bring about a transitional government. It is welcome that the US now seems fully aware that Iran is central to this challenge, and that dialogue with Tehran – and not only threats – are needed. In comments made before the final deal was struck, President Obama made clear that Iran will have a place at the conference about peace in Syria. He cautioned Iran that its getting closer to a nuclear weapon is a far larger issue to the US than Syrian chemical weapons, and warned Tehran it should not conclude that the readiness to strike against it was gone. However, Obama also signalled that the deal reached in Geneva showed there is a potential to resolve these issues diplomatically. One would hope this potential will soon be explored. It could improve the atmosphere. Iran has a new president who seems intent on entering into a calmer dialogue about its nuclear programme and reducing the concerns about it. Opportunities for talks will arise very soon during the UN general assembly session in New York. They should be well used. Years of talks with Iran have gone stale, and are accompanied by increasing threats and crippling economic pressures. As its nuclear-power programme has no practical need for more and higher levels of uranium enrichment, the suspicion that Iran aims to produce a nuclear weapon is understandable. However, it should also be understood that rather than hearing strained legal arguments that it has \"forfeited\" a right to enrichment, Iran has a need – as a matter of pride and dignity – to hear that under the non-proliferation treaty it has a right to enrich for peaceful purposes just as it has a duty to refrain from making a nuclear weapon. If the situation is not ready for such statements, Iran might bring about a good measure of detente if it chose to declare unilaterally that for a number of years at least it sees a need for enrichment only to the low levels required for nuclear power reactors and will enable the International Atomic Energy Agency to fully verify this production."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2014/jan/29/uk-10-million-homes-solar-panels-2020","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-29T16:50:49Z","webTitle":"UK should have 10 million homes with solar panels by 2020, experts say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/29/uk-10-million-homes-solar-panels-2020","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jan/29/uk-10-million-homes-solar-panels-2020","fields":{"headline":"UK should have 10 million homes with solar panels by 2020, experts say","bodyText":"Ten million homes in the UK should have their roofs covered with solar panels in the next six years, if the country is to fulfil its renewable energy potential, energy experts said on Wednesday. That number - of more than a third of households generating energy from the sun - would allow the UK to produce about 6% of its annual electricity needs from solar power, with as much as 40% coming from the panels on sunny days in summer, by 2020. These figures are comparable to those of Germany, which has made a major push on solar power in the last decade. Installing more solar panels brings the costs of the technology down dramatically, because of economies of scale, as the example of Germany and other countries shows. By 2030, the cost of solar should be comparable to that of even the dirtiest forms of coal, and of gas, said Ajay Gambhir, of Imperial College London. Nearly half a million homes in the UK have solar panels installed today, recent figures show. At present, the cost of solar power in Germany is about Euro cents 10 per kilowatt hour, compared with about 6 to 8 Euro cents per kilowatt hour for “brown” coal – the most carbon-intensive form of the fuel, but also the cheapest – and gas. On current trends that should reduce to 6 to 8 Euro cents per kilowatt hour for solar energy by 2030, while the cost of fossil fuels is expected to stay the same, according to academics from the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, who published a briefing paper on the subject on Wednesday. But these aspirations will only be met in the UK if the government spearheads a move to install more solar panels, not just on houses but also on large public buildings and offices, and through the building of “solar farms”, in which large arrays of panels cover fields. Germany has managed to incorporate renewable power from sun and wind into its energy mix successfully, thanks in part to the government’s decision in 2011 after the Fukushima nuclear incident to pursue an “energiewende” – a nationwide energy transformation – to remove nuclear power and concentrate more resources on renewable energy. The UK would face more serious challenges, said the researchers from Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute, as the incorporation of renewable energy into the electricity grid has so far been slow. Many of the UK’s current coal-fired power stations and ageing nuclear reactors will have to be taken out of service by the end of the decade, but efforts to replace this generation with renewable power have so far progressed slowly. The government began to row back on its commitment on subsidies to households with solar panels in 2011, scaling down dramatically the 'feed-in tariff' payments available, which created turmoil in the market. The prime minister, David Cameron, is alleged last year to have railed against the “green crap” in energy bills, by which he is understood to have meant charges for the roll-out of energy efficiency as well as subsidies for renewables. Solar energy could be in for a massive expansion in the UK, according to the research from the Grantham Institute, but this would require favourable policies to encourage the installation of millions more panels on rooftops across Britain. Modern photovoltaic panels can generate energy even in cloudy conditions, though they perform better when it is bright. In recent weeks, the main focus of government energy generation policy has been shale gas, which the prime minister spoke out for in Davos, the annual meeting of the rich and powerful. Ministers have argued that shale gas exploration could be a major source of indigenous energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/nov/29/european-commission-nuclear-safety-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-29T13:59:00Z","webTitle":"Brussels report on nuclear power finds no common safety standards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/29/european-commission-nuclear-safety-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/nov/29/european-commission-nuclear-safety-report","fields":{"headline":"Brussels report on nuclear power finds no common safety standards","bodyText":"The European commission last month released a preliminary report on the stress tests carried out on Europe's nuclear power plants. The document is only 15 pages plus annexes, but some countries seem to have already drawn their own conclusions. The Czech Republic affirms that its nuclear power stations are not at risk from major earthquakes or floods. Belgium considers that its seven reactors are protected against quakes, floods, terrorist attacks and falling planes. The report produced by Brussels puts the case for tighter safety rules, but with only limited scope. It notes that the regulations already in force before the Fukushima disaster in March are still not being applied throughout the European Union. Twelve EU states, including the UK, Poland, Slovakia and Belgium, have not updated national legislation in line with a 2009 directive on nuclear safety. \"At present, there are no common safety standards or criteria for nuclear power plants in the EU,\" notes the report, suggesting that the stress tests could lead to \"minimum technical criteria\". The commission cites as one of Fukushima's key lessons the need to secure the \"effective independence\" of national regulatory authorities, and to enhance the technical and scientific competence of key players. But the report makes no reference to the possible shutdown of reactors failing stress tests. Nor does it answer the objections raised by Greenpeace, which holds that 12 plants in eastern Europe are dangerous and should be decommissioned. Nor yet is there any mention of testing evacuation plans. After the Fukushima accident the European council called for stress tests for the consequences of any type of accident of human or natural origin. In all 143 reactors are operating in 14 member states. The report is based on information submitted in August by some countries. Others, including France, will send in their appraisals at the end of the year. The commission will present a final report in June 2012. The method for the appraisals was decided in May. After noisy discussions the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group produced a text that fell far short of the strict requirements set by Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger. The plan that was agreed comprises three phases: self-evaluation by plant operators; examination of the findings by national regulators, who then draft a report; then a peer review process by experts and others appointed by the Commission. Their conclusions should be made public.

After their second round of talks with the CDU, Green party leaders said there was no resilient basis for entering a coalition with the conservatives. The areas where the two parties could not find sufficient common ground included tax rises, the introduction of a minimum wage and Europe, they said. Ironically, the Greens and the CDU also disagreed over the future of Germany's Energiewende, or nuclear phase-out; the very policy area that had led to speculation about a CDU-Green coalition in the first place. In 2011 Merkel announced the gradual closure of all German nuclear power stations by 2022 – something the Greens had been calling for for some time. \"On the question of the nuclear phase-out, which is a key challenge for us, we twice tried to get a more concrete answer, but we failed to reach an agreement,\" said the Greens' vice-president, Claudia Roth. Merkel's answers had been \"diffuse, not very concrete\". The announcement now increases the pressure on the next round of coalition talks between Merkel's party and the Social Democrats. The SPD is still seen by many as close to the coal industry but shares considerable common ground with Merkel on her other big challenge for the next four years: the future of the eurozone. Should coalition talks with the SPD fail nonetheless, a coalition between the SPD, the Greens and the leftwing Die Linke, or even a return to the polling booths, is not out of the question.

The Socialist president, François Hollande, and his prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, have seen their popularity ratings fall over the summer as the French economic crisis deepens. Already struggling with a difficult return to work after the holiday season, the government has now been shaken by the row over nuclear energy. The Green party, which has two ministers in the Socialist-led government, was taken aback after the minister for industrial recovery, Arnaud Montebourg, described nuclear power as an \"industry of the future\", seeming to cast doubt on a commitment to shut power stations and reduce France's devotion to atomic energy. France is the most nuclear-dependent country in the world, with 75% of its energy coming from nuclear. In a deal with the Greens before this year's parliamentary and presidential elections, Socialists promised to reduce the share of nuclear in French electricity production to 50% by 2025, shutting 24 nuclear reactors. But so far, only one of France's 59 nuclear reactors, at Fessenheim in eastern France, is due to be decommissioned. Montebourg called nuclear energy a \"tremendous asset\" with a key future role, saying: \"We need energy that is not too expensive.\" He was backed by the interior minister, Manuel Valls, who said nuclear was undeniably a part of the future of French industry. The Green MP Noël Mamère condemned the comments as a provocation. Another Green MP, Denis Baupin, said the government was \"divorced from reality\". The prime minister tried to play down the row, and Montebourg's views were presented as personal opinions. But the timing was unfortunate, two weeks before the government's big environmental conference, designed to convince a sceptical environmental lobby that Hollande is serious about green issues. Meanwhile, the Socialists are trying to contain internal divisions over the ratification of the new European budget treaty. Relieved that the French constitution will not need to be modified to accommodate the treaty, the government must still submit the text to a parliament vote in October. But some in the Greens and on the left wing of the Socialist party have misgivings about losing sovereignty to Brussels and imposing austerity rules which they say would be socially and economically damaging to France. Jean-Luc Mélenchon's leftist Front de Gauche and Eva Joly, the former Green presidential candidate, have called for a referendum. The debate around the treaty ratification is already reopening political wounds from the sparring about the 1992 Maastricht treaty and France's 2005 no vote against the EU constitution. The prime minister has taken a hard line, telling Socialist MPs they should fall in line with the government amid \"risk of a European crisis\". Meanwhile, in its first key move after the summer break, the government on Tuesday temporarily cut the price of petrol and diesel by up to six cents a litre to help French households. The cost will be shared between oil companies and the state, which will lose €300m in tax revenues. The move stopped short of Hollande's campaign promise of a freeze on fuel prices, which had been seen as too complicated and a legal minefield."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/jan/23/davos-2014-meditation-goldie-hawn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-23T19:27:01Z","webTitle":"And breathe ...

Goldie Hawn and a monk bring meditation to Davos","bodyText":"Aside from the business suits, it could be an ashram in the foothills of the Himalayas. Sixty or so Davos movers and shakers are being urged to gaze at their thoughts by a French Buddhist monk swathed in robes of red and yellow. \"Meditation is about mastering your thoughts, it's about being in charge of your mind. It's real freedom,\" said Matthieu Ricard. \"You are not the slave of your thoughts. One way is to just gaze at them … like a shepherd sitting above a meadow watching the sheep,\" added the monk, a man who speaks, lectures and writes about being happy. Eyes closed tight, the delegates of the World Economic Forum in Davos have queued devotedly for half an hour for this early morning session. The attraction is not just the chance to learn how to meditate from one of the most respected masters of the art, but also to do so in the presence of movie star Goldie Hawn. Davos is not just about power meetings and deals – on Thursday it was also where the secrets of eastern religion met Hollywood: Hawn is in Davos on a mission to explain how she believes children can benefit from meditation. Those who have queued long enough to get into the room – 10 round tables, coffee and pastries in the corner – are completely silent as they receive instruction on how to be \"in charge of their minds\". They are learning the art of meditation even as President Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, is pledging in the main hall not to use his nuclear power to create weapons. Two bits of advice are being offered to those gazing at their difficult thoughts. Do not try to hide away from the problem and equally do not try to explode it like a time bomb. Much better to let it melt away – \"slowly melting like the frost under the morning sun\". Ricard leads three short moments of meditation, each one accompanied by soothing, reassuring words. Each of those present is studiously following the advice. They appear hooked. And would not be alone. The delegates are told how Steve Jobs of Apple mixed business with meditation. An article in Fortune magazine recently outlined how traders at Goldman Sachs – more widely known for their animal spirits – have also been coached in how to train their minds. Forget Leonardo DiCaprio and the Wolf of Wall Street: these guys have got their karma together. Hawn has been meditating since 1972 and probably needed all the calm she could muster just a few hours after sharing her experiences at WEF, when she posted pictures of herself with Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan then hastily had to take them down again after running into a Twitter storm focused on his anti-gay views. Goldie's session is not just all about the practical side of meditation. Charts flash up on the wall – this is Davos after all – showing lines that could be profit and loss charts, but actually represent brain activity. An academic – Richard Davidson of the Center for Investigating Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin – has a chart showing flu vaccines work better on those who have meditated. And he encourages everyone to give it a go and make it as commonplace as physical exercise became after the 1950s. \"The same thing will happen with mental exercise. You can begin with very small periods of exercise. Start with bite-sized chunks … We need a massive worldwide media campaign to teach people the fact that wellbeing can be learned,\" Davidson said. • This article was amended on 24 January 2014 to correct several errors in grammar and spelling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/sep/14/swedish-euro-referendum-britain-learn","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-14T17:41:00Z","webTitle":"Ten years on, what Britain can learn from the Swedish euro referendum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/14/swedish-euro-referendum-britain-learn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/14/swedish-euro-referendum-britain-learn","fields":{"headline":"Ten years on, what Britain can learn from the Swedish euro referendum","bodyText":"\"The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter,\" Winston Churchill famously said. He could have added that the best argument against elite rule is a five-minute conversation with your average politician. I used to be sceptical of referendums. They are populist instruments, I thought. Voters never vote on the actual issue. And what do voters know anyway? Then the euro happened. Saturday is the 10-year anniversary of the Swedish public voting no to joining the euro in a high-profile referendum, 56% to 42%. The Swedish elite was in shock. All the major parties, the national newspapers, the business organisations, including the Swedish CBI, and most of Stockholm's chattering classes favoured ditching the krona. According to some estimates, the yes campaign outspent the no campaign 10 to one. There were a lot of clever and genuine people on the yes side, making valid arguments such as eliminating exchange risk for business and replacing the flaky devaluation policies of the past. However, it was obvious that something wasn't quite right. Yes, perhaps Sweden could benefit from sharing a currency with Germany, the destination of many of its exports. But the euro wasn't about liberal economics: stretching from the Arctic circle to Sicily, it locked vastly different countries, cultures and economic structures, into one monetary system, under a single interest rate – forever binding together the problems of all its members, large or small. It was a system based on the hopelessly flawed assumption that politicians and central bankers would make the right decisions all the time. As with all referendums, there were various reasons why the Swedish public voted no, including an inherent bias in favour of the status quo. Fundamentally, though, most Swedes' gut instinct – bondförnuft as the Swedes say (literally \"farmer's common sense\") – told them that a serial defaulter with dubious finances, Greece, and a heavily industrialised exporter with an obsession with sound money, Germany, simply couldn't share the same currency. Swedes treated the exam question with the same kind of book-keepers' approach by which many of them run their own household economies. Whatever the experts told them, the arguments – and the numbers – simply didn't add up. Ten years on, Europe is shrouded in uncertainty, but one thing is clear: the Swedish public got it right, the elite got it wrong. Though there may have been some politicians in Sweden and elsewhere who saw the single currency as the ultimate way to set the snowball rolling towards an EU superstate, the euro was far more a case of cock-up than conspiracy. Today, 80-90% of Swedes oppose the euro, and the political and business elites are wary too – save the odd isolated politician doing an impression of the Japanese soldiers found in the 1960s refusing to believe the second world war had ended. However, referendums are by no means a magical potion. It's clear that there are cases where they're hijacked or misused – and where they lead to outcomes that no one intended or that settle nothing. Sweden itself has some less successful experiences with public votes. In 1980, a three-way referendum on whether to ditch nuclear power – arguably a populist kneejerk response to the Harrisburg disaster – generated a vote in favour of a vague plan to incrementally dismantle all nuclear plants. The result was totally inconclusive, leaving half the country embittered on the issue (Sweden still has nuclear power today). Incidentally, there's a lesson for David Cameron here. He has promised to negotiate a new settlement in the EU and put that to an in/out referendum by 2017. If that indeed happens, the worst possible outcome is a 49-51% type result, too close to call in either direction. As in Sweden in 1980, much of the population would feel disenfranchised and the EU debate will continue just as before. This isn't in either the UK's or Europe's interest. To avoid this scenario, there needs to be substantial and systemic changes, ideally rooted in EU-wide solutions so that they last (unilateral opt-outs tend to be eroded). That would allow a decisive vote in favour of the UK staying in a heavily reformed, slimmed-down EU. One can have different views on Cameron's strategy, but given public and political discontent about the EU status quo, sooner or later there will probably have to be a referendum to settle the Europe question in this country. And as the Swedish euro vote shows – warts and all, the public can opt for perfectly rational and responsible outcomes that would not occur if politicians were left to their own devices."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/apr/09/hungary-election-europe-prime-minister-viktor-orban","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-09T14:52:36Z","webTitle":"Hungary's election offers some disturbing lessons for Europe | Jan-Werner Mueller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/09/hungary-election-europe-prime-minister-viktor-orban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/09/hungary-election-europe-prime-minister-viktor-orban","fields":{"headline":"Hungary's election offers some disturbing lessons for Europe","bodyText":"There were no huge surprises about Hungary's vote last Sunday. Prime minister Viktor Orbán coasted to re-election, despite having proposed no specific programme for the next four years other than \"carry on\". Depending on the final vote tally, he might retain his two-thirds parliamentary majority (large enough to change the constitution at any time) – a highly disproportional result, given that his Fidesz party gained only about 44.5% of the vote (down from about 53%). Yet these elections offer disturbing lessons about what a populist, Russia-leaning rightwing government can do inside the EU today: fundamentally reshape the polity in a partisan image and offer an all-out anti-liberal policy model that is inching ever closer to Putin's ideal of governance. Above all, Hungary's vote shows that the extremist, outright racist right is not weakened, but in fact emboldened by such an approach. Especially in the run-up to the European elections in May, the rest of the continent should take note. Orbán thrives on conflict. He has used the many attacks on him – not least from the European commission – to justify what critics correctly see as a comprehensive attempt to undermine checks and balances, and remake the entire country in the image of one political party. According to Orbán, only Fidesz truly represents the nation; to be against Fidesz is not to be properly Hungarian. Hence there was no problem with writing a new constitution in 2011 which was only approved by Fidesz, and there was no issue with changing the electoral rules in such a manner that Fidesz gained an \"undue advantage\" (according to the OSCE). When Orbán then also enlarged the electorate to include ethnic Hungarians in countries such as Romania and Slovakia, Fidesz conveniently ended up confirming its core claim to legitimacy. It appears that these new voters overwhelmingly opted for the party that bestowed the vote on them, thus proving that they really are part of the proper nation. They might also be decisive in ensuring the party has its two-thirds majority. Inside the country, Fidesz has favoured the middle class, and especially the upper middle class, thereby building a core clientele of politically active supporters – while slashing benefits for the neediest (about a third of Hungarians live in poverty – don't be fooled by the glittering, EU-funded projects in the centre of Budapest). Still, Orbán was in fact fairly unpopular for much of the past four years. What changed the fortunes of his government was the decision to cut utility prices and force companies to indicate clearly on the actual bills how much Fidesz had saved consumers. Nothing wrong with this initiative, of course (other than the question of who exactly will end up paying for it) – and a clear sign of the desperate state of the Hungarian liberal-left that they could not think of any alternative policy to address ordinary people's sense that European multinationals are making huge profits off them. Orbán's long-term policy of nationalising energy, however, depends on a rather unsavoury partner: Budapest recently signed a loan agreement with Russia to upgrade a nuclear power plant. And, low and behold, Orbán – long an advocate of an opening to the east, including China – has made a point of not supporting western sanctions against Russia. Orbán is not Putin, and Hungarian elections are not rigged in the way Russian ones are. But there is now a polity and policy model inside the EU that is closer to Putin's than to the western European mainstream – and whose success may well depend on further support from Russia. While Orbán has sometimes defended himself in the same way Putin has – he is the sole guarantor of order, without him everything would be even worse, fascists might take over – the elections show the real dynamic to be the other way around. Orbán has presented Fidesz as the last bulwark against Jobbik, the anti-Roma and anti-semitic party. Yet Fidesz's nationalism – and its support for rewriting Hungarian history to whitewash its role in the Holocaust in particular – always ends up legitimising Jobbik's extremist rhetoric. Rather than crushing the party to his right, Orbán has helped it grow. Jobbik ran a relatively moderate campaign, attracting more centrist voters disgusted with the corruption in the Fidesz government, while retaining its racist core clientele (since there is no party to the right of Jobbik, they have nowhere else to go). Now, for the first time, Jobbik has made real inroads into the prosperous trans-Danubian regions, when the conventional wisdom held that the party would remain confined to eastern Hungary, the poorest part of the country. Fidesz might well tack further to the right in response, creating a vicious circle of ever more rabid nationalism. In his victory speech on Sunday, Orbán made a point of saying that citizens had chosen the EU (which Jobbik wishes to leave). Two days later, construction began on the hugely controversial memorial to the German occupation in 1944, which is rejected by Jewish organisations as relativising Hungary's role in the Holocaust. For how long can Orbán keep playing his double game with the EU and his western conservative and Christian Democratic friends in the European People's party (who just warmly congratulated him on his resounding victory)? How long before it is Jobbik – or, for that matter, Russia – who really reaps the benefits?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/03/three-month-delay-nuclear-waste-burial-cumbria","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-03T09:06:00Z","webTitle":"Cumbria delays nuclear burial decision amid rising worries about trust","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/03/three-month-delay-nuclear-waste-burial-cumbria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/03/three-month-delay-nuclear-waste-burial-cumbria","fields":{"headline":"Cumbria delays nuclear burial decision amid rising worries about trust","bodyText":"The fiasco on the west coast mainline – full coverage here – coincides with deepening unease about another vast exercise that depends on trust in government and civil service calculations. Exactly this issue of trust has also been highlighted this morning by the leader of the opposition, Ed Miliband. Read more in Andrew Sparrow's live conference blog here. The beautiful arc of the west coast in Cumbria is seeing growing unease about proposals to bury higher activity radioactive waste – the subject of a Guardian Northerner post in August That flagged up 11 October as a key date when Cumbrian councils would meet to debate a report based on three years of consultation and discussion. But the three principal authorities – Cumbria county and Allerdale and Copeland districts – have delayed this stage until January and asked the government for \"further information and clarity\". Here is their letter to Baroness Verma, minister in the department of energy and climate change, following a meeting with her last week: And page two: The delay reflects the increasing unhappiness of Cumbrians, foused through smaller bodies than the large councils, including parish councils, churches and other groups. The county is familiar with the tensions between nuclear power as (a) a risk and (b) a crucial employer, especially on the 'nuclear coast' where trains north from Barrow and south from Carlisle empty and fill at Sellafield with a tide of workers, morning and night. Councillor Eddie Martin, Conservative leader of Cumbria county council, says: This is not a decision which can be taken lightly and members don't yet feel we're in a position where we have all the information needed to make a decision on whether to continue to engage in the West Cumbria Managing Radioactive Waste Safely Partnership process. The government has always made it clear that if necessary, the process can be 'paused' while we seek clarification on unresolved issues. We're at that stage now and the next three months will involve all three councils working closely with the Government to get to a position where a decision can be made. Councillor Elaine Woodburn, Labour leader of Copeland borough council, says a little more reluctantly: We already have a considerable amount of information from the work of the MRWS Partnership, although there are many questions that could only be answered if further studies and investigations are carried out as part of the siting process. However, in the meantime we will be working with the county council and Allerdale over the next few months to get further clarification from Government on some of the points in the Partnership's report. The third of the trio, Alan Smith, Labour leader of Allerdale, says: The West Cumbria MRWS Partnership spent a lot of time looking at these issues and engaging with local people. The councils need to take full account of the Partnership's report and ensure they have the information they need before making a decision. The Partnership's report presented the issues and local opinions but did not go so far as to recommend that councils should take part, as the Government hopes, in the proposed search for a burial site. Without their participation, the idea would almost certainly be doomed. In a section to which the west coast rail debacle lends extra weight, it underlined that 'a lack of trust appears to us to be at the root of many of the key concerns raised by the public and stakeholders'. This is a central argument of the many objectors, who have also drawn up a wealth of expert advice on the risks of burial and the complex local geology; anyone who has walked the Lake District fells will get their point. The Partnership is also particularly concerned about the worth of government guarantees that councils would be able to withdraw from the process right up to the point where work was otherwise able to start on building the nuclear grave. The changing timescale for this has added to concern: original estimates by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority that burial could start in 2075 crept closer to 2040 and then, in a leaked departmental memo, to talk of 2029. The three councils now say that they want: • Better understanding of the detail and timescale involved in meeting the government's commitment to make this right of withdrawal legally binding. • Clarification from the government about the basis on which a community benefits package in return for accepting the waste would be negotiated. • The consideration of alternative radioactive waste management solutions in parallel with the MRWS programme in case a suitable site is not identified, either because the geology is not suitable or for other reasons. The last request is all-important and could sink the whole proposal, although the geological question is naturally one of the main issues which the proposed detailed study would investigate. The Partnership says: Although a few geologists believe there is already enough evidence to show that West Cumbria's geology is unsuitable, most of the experts agree that there is not enough definitive information available at this time. The process to secure more detailed information about the geology of the area will involve a series of studies and investigations and will therefore take a substantial period of time. This would mean that the uncertainty about whether there is anywhere with suitable geology will continue for a number of years. The councils also plan to use the extra three months to ensure funding for community representatives to monitor and scrutinise the work if the detailed study does go ahead. They will then hold the postponed 11 October meeting in January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/defence-and-security-blog/2014/feb/12/armed-forces-defence-army-navy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-12T17:18:00Z","webTitle":"The Navy soars while the Army is in danger of sinking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/defence-and-security-blog/2014/feb/12/armed-forces-defence-army-navy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/defence-and-security-blog/2014/feb/12/armed-forces-defence-army-navy","fields":{"headline":"The Navy soars while the Army is in danger of sinking","bodyText":"You have to admire the chutzpah of the first sea lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas. The Royal Navy faced \"the fight of our generation\" to ensure it remained credible, he told an audience of sailors earlier this month at Trinity House, London, which is responsible for lighthouses and other aids to navigation. Britain must commit to using its two new aircraft carriers and replace its nuclear deterrent or fall out of the first division of global military powers, he warned. The navy needed submarines, fighter jets, Royal Marine vessels and surveillance aircraft at a \"sensible and credible level of scale\", he said. \"Make the Royal Navy 'uncredible', and we cease to be a first division player,\" he said. \"Our responsibility to the Navy we command and lead, our responsibility to defence, and our responsibility to the nation we serve, is to fight to deliver a credible Navy.\" The two carriers are being built in Scotland, and the Queen is due to launch the first , the Queen Elizabeth, in July though it will not be fully operational until the end of the decade. The fate of the second carrier, to be named Prince of Wales, will be decided in the next defence review, after the 2015 general election. The cost of the two carriers are now said to be £6.2bn, nearly twice the original estimate. Unsurprisingly, Zambellas also made clear that in his view Britain should continue to maintain a continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent (CASD, as it is known) with a new Trident fleet of four submarines. There is growing scepticism about whether Britain now needs such a nuclear force (with the subs alone estimated to cost at least £20bn) since the country is not being threatened with attack by a nuclear power, and its nuclear weapons are not likely to deter what are regarded as its main enemies, ie terrorists. Hence the first sea lord welcomed the commitment by David Cameron last month to a \"full spectrum\" navy, which he said should include \"proper carriers with credible numbers of jets, properly supported [by] credible numbers of people\". Unashamedly, Zambellas continued: \"We must argue relentlessly that if we want to be a credible nation, then we need a credible Navy.\" Perhaps the first sea lord was stung into such fighting talk by suggestions at the end of last year by General Sir Nick Houghton, the chief of defence staff, that Britain has increasingly spent money on large capital programmes to provide the shipbuilding industry with work rather than the military with what it needed. After referring to \"exquisite equipment, but insufficient resources to man that equipment or train on it\", Houghton added that \"across defence I would identify the Royal Navy as being perilously close to its critical mass in manpower terms\". Now the government is close to a deal to buy the first batch of fourteen F35 Lightning jets to fly from the carriers at an estimated £58m each. If long-term running costs for Britain's Lightning fleet are also taken into account, the deal will cost some £2.5bn, according to Mark Urban, BBC Newsight's defence and diplomatic editor. The Ministry of Defence wants to buy 48 Lightnings to start flying from at least one of the carriers from 2020, eight years later than they were originally due to start flying. The deal is unsurprisingly enthusiastically backed by Sir Jonathon Band, a former first sea lord and now non-executive director of the UK arm of Lockheed Martin, manufacturer of the Lightnings. The MoD do not deny reports that the plane still has technical problems, mainly to do with software, which could further delay their entry into service. Some defence analysts say the planes will also be slower, and with a more limited range, than first anticipated, and vulnerable to the increasing sophistication and range of missiles being developed by potentialy hostile countries, including China. And while the Navy prepares to get the largest ships in its history, and the most expensive jets, the Army, which is to be shrunk from more than 100,000 to 82,000 by 2020, and is under severe budgetary pressure, is engaged in immediate, vital, work - saving British homes from floods."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/22/fallout-hinkley-point-decision","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-22T20:00:04Z","webTitle":"Letters: Fallout from the Hinkley Point decision","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/22/fallout-hinkley-point-decision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/22/fallout-hinkley-point-decision","fields":{"headline":"Fallout from the Hinkley Point decision","bodyText":"Isabel Hilton asks (Report, 18 October) what's in the nuclear energy deal for China. Well, China might get a major share of the UK nuclear market, which over time could equate to at least 25% of the total electricity generation market. The huge benefit from overpriced electricity on this scale flowing to the Chinese would make the recent price rises at British Gas look like a free gift offer. Surely the only effective defence against this situation is to nationalise the Hinkley nuclear station project to get back control of nuclear electricity pricing and technology for the UK. This would enable the UK to set nuclear electricity prices at an appropriate level. The recent flotation of Royal Mail has shown there is plenty of money around to raise a government bond. The Royal Mail funds would make a nice down payment. A sum equivalent to the proceeds of the sale of UK nuclear technology to Hitachi would also be useful. Is it too late to come to our senses? John Pickering Labour Finance and Industry Group • George Monbiot now has to face the daunting implications of his commitment to nuclear power (Comment, 22 October). The 92.5p guaranteed electricity price for 35 years, double the existing price and probably higher than the cost of renewable electricity by 2023, when the first power is generated, seems an economically reckless commitment – a grim legacy for our children and grandchildren. There is also the less publicised Treasury 65% guarantee of the £14bn construction finance, a further apparent guarantee for construction-cost overruns, compensation if EDF closes Hinkley early and an open-ended public guarantee to deal with the waste – adding to the 80-year £80bn clean-up costs we are already saddled with. This begins to look like a \"nuclear at any price\" Faustian pact, but it is the true measure of the cost of nuclear. If the government could have had a cheaper deal, it would have. The only hope of some economic rationality is that the state-aided distortion of the power market by this preferential deal will be declared illegal by the EU.

Public anger has been intensified by accusations that the Big Six - British Gas-owner Centrica, EDF, Npower, SSE, E.on and Scottish Power – tend to raise bills in quickly when wholesale gas prices go up, but fail to cut them so much when the international market falls. Critics also rail against the pay deals of energy bosses, such as the five executives at British Gas who shared £16m last year, while millions of people are officially classified as being in \"fuel poverty\". Charities and consumer groups praised Miliband's pledge to halt this upward march of profits and prices. Which?, the consumer group, said Labour's policy would \"give hope to millions\", after calculating market flaws mean consumers have paid almost £4bn too much since 2010. But within minutes of the announcement, Labour began to get a taste of the almighty battle with the energy firms that may lie ahead. Unsurprisingly, the companies deny all charges they make excessive profits, arguing higher international gas prices and green taxes are to blame for inflation-busting increases in bills. They also insist their profits are crucial if the government wants them to invest £100bn in gas plants, nuclear power, wind farms and other infrastructure over the next decade. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, said such a freeze at a time of rising costs would destroy its business and those of its rivals, while Angela Knight, the head of industry lobby group Energy UK, warned the policy would \"make the prospect of energy shortages a reality, pushing up the prices for everyone.\" Knight also argued that threatening to split up the companies by separating their generation and supply divisions will also \"send a clear message to overseas investors that the UK is closed for business\". More surprisingly, Labour's proposals provoked a cautious reaction from Consumer Futures, a watchdog that campaigns for lower prices in the energy, water and postal sectors. Adam Scorer, its director, warned the prospect of a freeze \"may ramp up prices in the short term\" and breaking up the companies could cause delays in getting them to invest in new power plants and turbines. There was also some confusion over how Miliband would manage to bring in a freeze immediately, without legislation, if the party wins in 2015. Ofgem, the energy regulator, has the power to approve some temporary price controls, but one senior Labour minister acknowledged they would have to be braced for a judicial review. Party sources said Labour has taken legal advice that the policy is workable. They also point out that energy companies are in line for substantial subsidies from the taxpayer to build new nuclear power plants and renewables, making it worthwhile for them to stay in the UK. Two years before an election, Labour appears willing to take the risk of a major row, perhaps not least because it puts the Tories and Lib Dems in such a tricky position. The coalition's reaction suggested they were rattled as Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat energy secretary, was quick to warn the public that a return to price controls could cause the lights to go out, reminding people that price-fixing in California \"resulted in an electricity crisis and blackouts\". Greg Barker, a Tory energy minister, also tweeted his disapproval of the \"bonkers bill freeze\". At the same time, David Cameron was being urged by campaigners to act against rising bills or face accusations he is backing the big energy companies. The prime minister has already pledged to make energy companies put customers on the lowest tariffs, but charities such as National Energy Action warn this does not go far enough to ease pressures on families this winter. At the very least, Miliband's energy freeze-for-all will pile pressure on the prime minister to do better , signalling it may be a smart political move despite the hurdles to its success in practice"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2011/sep/30/nuclear-power-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-30T15:25:42Z","webTitle":"The nuclear power plans that have survived Fukushima","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/30/nuclear-power-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/sep/30/nuclear-power-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"The nuclear power plans that have survived Fukushima","bodyText":"The quest for energy independence, rising power needs and a desire for political weight all mean that few developing countries with nuclear ambitions have abandoned them in the light of the Fukushima accident. Jordan's planned nuclear plant is part of a strategy to deal with acute water and energy shortages. The Jordan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) wants Jordan to get 60 per cent of its energy from nuclear by 2035. Currently, obtaining energy from neighbouring Arab countries costs Jordan about a fifth of its gross domestic product. The country is also one of the world's most water-poor nations. Jordan plans to desalinate sea water from the Gulf of Aqaba to the south, then pump it to population centres in Amman, Irbid, and Zarqa, using its nuclear-derived energy. After the Fukushima disaster, Jordan started re-evaluating safety procedures for its nuclear reactor, scheduled to begin construction in 2013. The country also considered more safety procedures for construction and in ongoing geological and environmental investigations. \"The government would not reverse its decision to build nuclear reactors in Jordan because of the Fukushima disaster,\" says Abdel-Halim Wreikat, vice Chairman of the JAEC. \"Our plant type is a third-generation pressurised water reactor, and it is safer than the Fukushima boiling water reactor.\" Wreikat argues that \"the nuclear option for Jordan at the moment is better than renewable energy options such as solar and wind, as they are still of high cost.\" But some Jordanian researchers disagree. \"The cost of electricity generated from solar plants comes down each year by about five per cent, while the cost of producing electricity from nuclear power is rising year after year,\" says Ahmed Al-Salaymeh, director of the Energy Centre at the University of Jordan. He called for more economic feasibility studies of the nuclear option. And Ahmad Al-Malabeh, a professor in the Earth and Environmental Sciences department of Hashemite University, adds: \"Jordan is rich not only in solar and wind resources, but also in oil shale rock, from which we can extract oil that can cover Jordan's energy needs in the coming years, starting between 2016 and 2017 ... this could give us more time to have more economically feasible renewable energy.\" Finance, rather than Fukushima, may delay South Africa's nuclear plans, which were approved just five days after the Japanese disaster. South Africa remains resolute in its plans to build six new nuclear reactors by 2030. Katse Maphoto, the director of Nuclear Safety, Liabilities and Emergency Management at the Department of Energy, says that the government conducted a safety review of its two nuclear reactors in Cape Town, following the Fukushima event. But the government adopted its Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) for 2010-2030 five days after the Fukushima accident. Elliot Mulane, communications manager for the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation, (NECSA) a public company established under the 1999 Nuclear Energy Act that promotes nuclear research, said the timing of the decision indicated \"the confidence that the government has in nuclear technologies\". And Dipuo Peters, energy minister, reiterated the commitment in her budget announcement earlier this year (26 May), saying: \"We are still convinced that nuclear power is a necessary part of our strategy that seeks to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions through a diversified portfolio, comprising some fossil-based, renewable and energy efficiency technologies\". James Larkin, director of the Radiation and Health Physics Unit at the University of the Witwatersrand, believes South Africa is likely to go for the relatively cheap, South Korean generation three reactor. Larkin says nuclear energy is the only alternative to coal for generating adequate electricity. \"What other alternative do we have? Renewables are barely going to do anything,\" he said. He argues that nuclear is capable of supplying 85 per cent of the base load, or constantly needed, power supply, while solar energy can only produce between 17 and 25 per cent. But, despite government confidence, Larkin says that a shortage of money may delay the country's nuclear plans. \"The government has said yes but hasn't said how it will pay for it. This is going to end up delaying by 15 years any plans to build a nuclear station.\" Planned Ninh Thuan nuclear plant Vietnam hopes its first nuclear plant, Ninh Thuan, will be completed by 2020 Vietnam's nuclear energy targets remain ambitious despite scientists' warning of a tsunami risk. Vietnam's plan to power 10 per cent of its electricity grid with nuclear energy within 20 years is the most ambitious nuclear energy plan in South-East Asia. The country's first nuclear plant, Ninh Thuan, is to be built with support from a state-owned Russian energy company and completed by 2020. Le Huy Minh, director of the Earthquake and Tsunami Warning Centre at Vietnam's Institute of Geophysics, has warned that Vietnam's coast would be affected by tsunamis in the adjacent South China Sea. The Ninh Thuan nuclear plant would sit 80 to 100 kilometres from a fault line on the Vietnamese coast, potentially exposing it to tsunamis, according to state media. But Vuong Huu Tan, president of the state-owned Vietnam Atomic Energy Commission, told state media in March, however, that lessons from the Fukushima accident will help Vietnam develop safe technologies. And John Morris, an Australia-based energy consultant who has worked as a geologist in Vietnam, says the seismic risk for nuclear power plants in the country would not be \"a major issue\" as long as the plants were built properly. Japan's nuclear plants are \"a lot more earthquake prone\" than Vietnam's would be, he adds. Vietnam is unlikely to experience much in the way of anti-nuclear protests, unlike neighbouring Indonesia and the Philippines, where civil society groups have had more influence, says Kevin Punzalan, an energy expert at De La Salle University in the Philippines. Warnings from the Vietnamese scientific community may force the country's ruling communist party to choose alternative locations for nuclear reactors, or to modify reactor designs, but probably will not cause extreme shifts in the one-party state's nuclear energy strategy, Punzalan tells SciDev.Net. President Benigno Aquino III President Benigno Aquino III said the mothballed Bataan nuclear reactor will never be used for its original purpose. Will the Philippines' plans to rehabilitate a never-used nuclear power plant survive the Fukushima accident? The Philippines is under a 25-year moratorium on the use of nuclear energy which expires in 2022. The government says it remains open to harnessing nuclear energy as a long-term solution to growing electricity demand, and its Department of Science and Technology has been making public pronouncements in favour of pursuing nuclear energy since the Fukushima accident. Privately, however, DOST officials acknowledge that the accident has put back their job of winning the public over to nuclear by four or five years. In the meantime, the government is trying to build capacity. The country lacks, for example, the technical expertise. Carmencita Bariso, assistant director of the Department of Energy's planning bureau, says that, despite the Fukushima accident, her organisation has continued with a study on the viability, safety and social acceptability of nuclear energy. Bariso says the study would include a proposal for \"a way forward\" for the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, the first nuclear reactor in South East Asia at the time of its completion in 1985. The $2.3-billion Westinghouse light water reactor, about 60 miles north of the capital, Manila, was never used, though it has the potential to generate 621 megawatts of power. President Benigno Aquino III, whose mother, President Corazon Aquino, halted work on the facility in 1986 because of corruption and safety issues, has said it will never be used as a nuclear reactor but could be privatised and redeveloped as a conventional power plant. But Mark Cojuangco, former lawmaker, authored a bill in 2008 seeking to start commercial nuclear operations at the Bataan reactor. His bill was not passed before Congress adjourned last year and he acknowledges that the Fukushima accident has made his struggle more difficult. \"To go nuclear is still the right thing to do,\" he says. \"But this requires a societal decision. We are going to spark public debates with a vengeance as soon as the reports from Fukushima are out.\" Amended bills seeking both to restart the reactor, and to close the issue by allowing either conversion or permanent closure, are pending in both the House and the Senate. Greenpeace, which campaigns against nuclear power, believes the Fukushima accident has dimmed the chances of commissioning the Bataan plant because of \"increased awareness of what radioactivity can do to a place\". Many parts of the country are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters, which critics say makes it unsuitable both for the siting of nuclear power stations and the disposal of radioactive waste. Boy in Kenyan slum The demand for electricity is overwhelming in Kenya In Kenya, nuclear proponents argue for a geothermal – nuclear mix In the same month as the Fukushima accident, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency approved Kenya's application for its first nuclear power station (31 March), a 35,000 megawatt facility to be built at a cost of Sh950 billion (US$9.8 billion) on a 200-acre plot on the Athi Plains, about 50km from Nairobi. The plant, with construction driven by Kenya's Nuclear Electricity Project Committee, should be commissioned in 2022. The government claims it could satisfy all of Kenya's energy needs until 2040. The demand for electricity is overwhelming in Kenya. Less than half of residents in the capital, Nairobi, have grid electricity, while the rural rate is two per cent. James Rege, Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Energy, Communication and Information, takes a broader view than the official government line, saying that geothermal energy, from the Rift Valley project is the most promising option. It has a high production cost but remains the country's \"best hope\". Nuclear should be included as \"backup\". \"We are viewing nuclear energy as an alternative source of power. The cost of fossil fuel keeps escalating and ordinary Kenyans can't afford it,\" Rege tells SciDev.Net. Hydropower is limited by rivers running dry, he says. And switching the country's arable land to biofuel production would threaten food supplies. David Otwoma, secretary to the Energy Ministry's Nuclear Electricity Development Project, agrees that Kenya will not be able to industrialise without diversifying its energy mix to include more geothermal, nuclear and coal. Otwoma believes the expense of generating nuclear energy could one day be met through shared regional projects but, until then, Kenya has to move forward on its own. According to Rege, much as the nuclear energy alternative is promising, it is extremely important to take into consideration the Fukushima accident. \"Data is available and it must be one step at a time without rushing things,\" he says. Otwoma says the new nuclear Kenya can develop a good nuclear safety culture from the outset, \"but to do this we need to be willing to learn all the lessons and embrace them, not forget them and assume that won't happen to us\". Oil barrels Nigeria: would nuclear bring more benefit than oil has? Undeterred by Fukushima, Nigeria is forging ahead with nuclear collaborations. There is no need to panic because of the Fukushima accident, says Shamsideen Elegba, chair of the Forum of Nuclear Regulatory Bodies in Africa. Nigeria has the necessary regulatory system to keep nuclear activities safe. \"The Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Authority [NNRA] has established itself as a credible organisation for regulatory oversight on all uses of ionising radiation, nuclear materials and radioactive sources,\" says Elegba who was, until recently, the NNRA's director general. \"It is not only that we say so: an international audit came here in 2006 to assess our procedure and processes and confirmed the same. Elegba is firmly of the view that blame for the Fukushima accident should be allocated to nature rather than human error. \"Japan is one of the leaders not only in that industry, but in terms of regulatory oversight. They have a very rigorous system of licensing. We have to make a distinction between a natural event, or series of natural events and engineering infrastructure, regulatory infrastructure, and safety oversight.\" Erepamo Osaisai, Director General of the Nigeria Atomic Energy Commission (NAEC), has said there is \"no going back\" on Nigeria's nuclear energy project after Fukushima. Nigeria is likely to recruit the Russian State Corporation for Atomic Energy, ROSATOM, to build its first proposed nuclear plant. A delegation visited Nigeria (26- 28 July) and a bilateral document is to be finalised before December. Nikolay Spassy, director general of the corporation, said during the visit: \"The peaceful use of nuclear power is the bedrock of development, and achieving [Nigeria's] goal of being one of the twenty most developed countries by the year 2020 would depend heavily on developing nuclear power plants.\" ROSATOM points out that the International Atomic Energy Agency monitors and regulates power plant construction in previously non-nuclear countries. But Nnimmo Bassey, executive director of the Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN), said \"We cannot see the logic behind the government's support for a technology that former promoters in Europe, and other technologically advanced nations, are now applying brakes to. \"What Nigeria needs now is investment in safe alternatives that will not harm the environment and the people. We cannot accept the nuclear option.\" Cairo Egypt was the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to have a nuclear programme Thirsty for electricity, and desirous of political clout, Egypt is determined that neither Fukushima ― nor revolution ― will derail its nuclear plans. Egypt was the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to own a nuclear programme, launching a research reactor in 1961. In 2007 Egypt 'unfroze' a nuclear programme that had stalled in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. After the Egyptian uprising in early 2011, and the Fukushima accident, the government postponed an international tender for the construction of its first plant. Yassin Ibrahim, chairman of the Nuclear Power Plants Authority, told SciDev.Net: \"We put additional procedures in place to avoid any states of emergency but, because of the uprising, the tender will be postponed until we have political stability after the presidential and parliamentary election at the end of 2011\". Ibrahim denies the nuclear programme could be cancelled, saying: \"The design specifications for the Egyptian nuclear plant take into account resistance to earthquakes and tsunamis, including those greater in magnitude than any that have happened in the region for the last four thousand years. \"The reactor type is of the third generation of pressurised water reactors, which have not resulted in any adverse effects to the environment since they began operation in the early sixties.\" Ibrahim El-Osery, a consultant in nuclear affairs and energy at the country's Nuclear Power Plants Authority, points out that Egypt's limited resources of oil and natural gas will run out in 20 years. \"Then we will have to import electricity, and we can't rely on renewable energy as it is still not economic yet — Egypt in 2010 produced only two per cent of its needs through it.\" But there are other motives for going nuclear, says Nadia Sharara, professor of mineralogy at Assiut University. \"Owning nuclear plants is a political decision in the first place, especially in our region. And any state that has acquired nuclear technology has political weight in the international community,\" she says. \"Egypt has the potential to own this power as Egypt's Nuclear Materials Authority estimates there are 15,000 tons of untapped uranium in Egypt.\" And she points out it is about staying ahead with technology too. \"If Egypt freezes its programme now because of the Fukushima nuclear disaster it will fall behind in many science research fields for at least the next 50 years,\" she warned.

Ed Davey, speaking to journalists at the United Nations climate change talks on Friday as the fortnight-long conference in Warsaw drew to a close, said the expertise of UK-based financiers would be essential to raising funds from the private sector to divert towards developing nations. Rich countries have agreed that poor nations should receive $100bn a year by 2020, to help move to a greener economy and to protect infrastructure against extreme weather. Although a proportion of this will come from taxpayers in rich countries, the public sector funding will be used to leverage private investment. \"There is a huge appetite within the City of London and investor institutions for this,\" said Davey. \"Lots of financial institutions are among the most progressive on climate change. Some insurance companies are the most progressive.\" He added: \"I have been really impressed by the level of interest and engagement from very large scale financial institutions, in London and elsewhere.\" London already has a climate finance industry, with expertise in finance, law and accounting, and some of these firms are looking to broader investment opportunities as the carbon trading market in the EU has shrunk. Davey was also notably enthusiastic about opportunities to work with China. \"I asked minister Xie [who leads the Chinese delegation in Warsaw] about the Chinese government's commitment to an 'ecological civilisation'. He was lyrical about how they are seeing this in a holistic way, with politics, economics, societal programmes, and cultural programmes … China is racing ahead.\" He said the Chinese government was committed to taking action on greenhouse gas emissions and the environment. He added: \"It was also very interesting [to see] the warmth they have for Britain, and the EU. They see Britain and the EU as leading the way, they see us as partners from whom they have learnt, whom they have copied.\" The coalition has been keen to court the Chinese government, which is seen as a key market and source of investment for the UK. David Cameron is shortly to make a major visit to China, building on the visit made by the chancellor George Osborne and mayor of London Boris Johnson in October. China now has an interest in the UK's low-carbon economy, through an investment in Hinkley Point C, the first new nuclear reactor scheduled to be built in the UK for nearly two decades.

From the Treasury's enthusiasm for a new dash-for-gas based on 'fracking' underground shale rock, to the announcement of a new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point, policy-makers' minds were focused on 'keeping the lights on' as Britain's creaking energy infrastructure comes up for renewal. For the rest of us, it is the relentless price-hikes in energy bills that stick in the mind, as power companies' profits soared and the spectre of fuel poverty raised its ugly head again. But if energy was ubiquitous in 2013, then climate change was virtually invisible. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its 5th Assessment Report, detailing in ever more gory detail the risks of unchecked climate change. Save for a brief ripple of news interest and commentary, the report was ignored. Rising bills should have placed the increasing costs (and carbon impacts) of finite fossil fuel resources at the heart of the debate about energy. But instead, green charges were axed from energy bills in a short-sighted strategy to deflect public anger. Even protests against 'fracking' in Balcombe focused on the risks of contaminating ground water, rather than the much greater climate risks of burning more gas. Climate change has been conspicuous by its absence – and for all our sake's, this has got to change. In a report published at the end of the year for the Climate Outreach &amp; Information Network (COIN) we argued that the challenge for anyone invested in re-igniting public interest in climate change – from businesses to community groups – is to start talking about it again. The vast majority of the public are not sceptical about climate change, or opposed to taking action to tackle it. For most people, the issue has simply fallen off their radar. But in the vacuum created by the absence of a climate change narrative from public figures, the appeal of sceptical arguments grows. It is understandable that people assume climate change is not such a big deal if they never receive the social signals that tell them that it is. Genuinely sustainable businesses – organisations that want to make sustainability their central organising principle – have a role to play. Channels of communication exist between companies and their customers that do not exist elsewhere. It is not possible to 'sell' climate change to people like physical products, because the challenge is one of collective action not individualistic consumption. But businesses have the ear of large numbers of people. The signals they send out – that climate change is real, that they want to play their part in tackling it – provide the background against which people form their own views. We don't all need to agree on what the best way of dealing with climate change is – just getting everyone to agree that it needs urgent and radical attention would be a start. If, instead of climate silence, the public received a chorus of climate change messages and signals from not just businesses but politicians and other public figures, then 2014 will hold a great deal more promise for getting to grips with sustainabiliy than 2013 did.

The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has spoken again, but does anyone expect government policies or public opinion to change much as a result? Fortunately, Keith Barnham does have something new to say: he cuts through the current morass of fossil-fuel and nuclear lobbyists' negative propaganda with a clear and original vision for solar power. He begins with Einstein's two great equations from 1905 and traces the consequences that led to our present impasse. You already know one of them, but the other, simpler equation, describing the interconvertibility of light and electricity (the photoelectric effect), is the equation that led to the silicon solar cell. Barnham argues that E = mc² is Bad and E = hf is Good. Despite their level-pegging in 1905, these two equations produced results at very different rates: nuclear research led to the atomic bomb inside 40 years, with nuclear-powered electricity a decade later. The first the world knew of the photoelectric effect was the photocell-operated automatic door, patented in 1959 and emphatically not the stuff of Manhattan Projects; silicon solar cells first powered a calculator in 1978. Barnham finds it hugely significant that the US and Britain, the nations that principally developed nuclear technology, lag behind the world in renewable solar energy, whereas the leaders in the field are the three defeated nations of the second world war: Germany, Japan and Italy, all of which were barred from developing nuclear weapons. He cites many instances of British governmental prejudice in favour of nuclear energy, despite a history of technical and commercial failures. Barnham is a leading researcher and developer of silicon solar cells and, for a while, his team held the world record for the most efficient version of this rapidly improving technology. He is not an ivory-tower scientist and has worked to commercialise his discoveries – but he has come up against the chronic failure of British industry and finance to nurture such innovative technology. He has a conceit to make the point about solar versus fossil and nuclear fuels. Imagine there really are more advanced civilisations in the universe than ours: the reason we've never heard from them is that they've taken one look at earth, where we are still burning fossil fuels and uranium instead of using solar power, and decided that \"earthlings are too stupid to be worth colonising\". Propagandists for fossil fuels and nuclear power have tried to discredit renewable energy with lazy, superficially plausible objections: in a country like Britain there's not sufficient sun, the wind doesn't always blow, and so on. But, as with all science, common sense is a poor guide. Barnham demonstrates that even in northern countries there is quite enough renewable energy available. Indeed, the Scandinavian countries plus Germany are the leaders in renewables, with Iceland (geothermal) and Norway (hydroelectric) close to 100% in renewable electricity generation. If they can do it, so can Britain. Barnham proposes a combination of technologies. As a leading photovoltaic solar cell inventor, he gives this pride of place, along with onshore wind, biogas from waste food and underground heat pumps. The last two are the least familiar but perhaps most promising for filling the gaps when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. In Sweden more than 90% of new homes have ground source heat pumps installed: just two metres down the ground retains sufficient warmth to provide hot water for a house via reverse refrigeration technology. Biogas technology puts to use the methane from household waste. Instead of adding to global warming by dumping waste in landfill (methane is 25 times more potent a greenhouse gas than CO2) it can be used either to supplement natural gas to generate electricity or for domestic heating and cooking. Perhaps the most important of all Barnham's correctives to the received wisdom on energy sources is his stress on developing biofuels from the very CO2 that is tipping the world's climate into the danger zone. Carbon dioxide is the source of all living plant material (biomass) and fossil fuels. The best-known technology for reducing CO2 emissions at source is carbon capture and storage, but why pay to bury it when it could be put to use? To do this we have to learn what every leaf knows: how to turn sunlight, CO2 and water into biomass. The race to mimic nature's two photosystems is the greatest scientific challenge of our time, the Manhattan Project and the Moonshot rolled into one: far more important in fact but not necessarily more expensive or more demanding of resources or ingenuity. Unravelling nature's mechanism is almost complete – an achievement arguably as great as DNA sequencing but, astonishingly, so far unknown to almost everyone. One of the pioneers is Barnham's colleague at Imperial College, James Barber. Photosystem II, which Barber revealed, is almost unbelievably complex. But that's because it evolved: we will be able to simplify it. Nature has to make sugar as the universal fuel, but we only need to make methanol to get the wheels of industry turning and to start the chemical synthesis chains. Labs all over the world are racing towards the goal of artificial photosynthesis to produce economically viable biofuel from CO2; this will certainly be achieved, despite the many hurdles thrown in the way by uncomprehending governments and malign lobbies. Besides urging the adoption of this ambitious solar project, Barnham also has sound practical advice for consumers wanting to install renewables at home: ground storage as well as solar panels. The vision is clear: making energy from CO2 solves two problems at once. It transforms CO2 from the problem to the solution. And this will change everything. When we can produce biomass from CO2 and sunlight we will have options on what to do with it. Unlike the electricity from solar cells it is stored solar energy, to use when and where we choose. Besides producing our energy, plastics, drugs, paints and so forth from it, we will be able to control to some extent how much of it re-enters the atmosphere as CO2. Solid matter is easier to sequester than gas. It is a bold vision, a necessary one, and the world needs to be fired up about it.

Later this month the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), will begin removing more than 1,500 fuel assemblies from the pool, the first step in a decommissioning process expected to last at least three decades. On Thursday, the Guardian witnessed Tepco's preparations for an unprecedented operation that the utility's critics claim has the potential to end in disaster. The risk posed to the reactor by earthquakes and other natural catastrophes has made removal of the fuel – 1,331 spent assemblies and 202 fresh ones – a matter of urgency. An event similar to the 9.0 magnitude quake that crippled the plant on 11 March 2011 could collapse the fuel pool altogether, some observers say, leading to the leaking of huge quantities of radiation into the atmosphere. Tepco, however, insists the structure could withstand such a quake. Reactor No 4 had been shut down for maintenance checks when the quake and subsequent tsunami struck, but a hydrogen explosion days later blew off its roof and exposed the fuel pool, located 100 feet above ground, to the elements. In the 32 months since the disaster, workers have reinforced the reactor building and covered it with a huge steel canopy. Tepco officials conceded, however, that the fuel removal carries significant risks, particularly if the assemblies collide or are exposed. \"If, for some reason, the water levels dropped, the fuel would quickly heat up,\" said Takashi Hara, a Tepco employee in charge of fuel removal. There are fears, too, that some of the uranium pellets inside the fuel rods may have been damaged, although Tepco says it has found no evidence of this. The man who will oversee the delicate operation played down fears of a major accident. \"The potential for another disaster is very close to impossible,\" said the plant's chief, Akira Ono. \"Removing spent fuel is done at any ordinary nuclear power plant, and the equipment and methods we'll be using here are not that different.\" Yet what is considered routine at other nuclear plants represents uncharted territory at Fukushima Daiichi. A newly built crane that will manoeuvre the fuel must be operated manually, rather than automatically, because the assemblies are not exactly where they should be; and the pool is still littered with tiny pieces of debris caused by the blast. Each batch of fuel rods will be placed into dry casks, which will then be lowered to ground level and transported to a safer storage site nearby. Tepco says work could begin as early as next week, adding that it hopes to complete the task by the end of next year. The risks prompted the head of Japan's nuclear regulator, Shunichi Tanaka, to call on Tepco to exercise extreme caution. \"The process involves a very large risk potential,\" he reportedly told the firm's president, Naomi Hirose. \"In a sense, it is more risky than the radioactive water crisis.\" Some nuclear experts say Tepco, still reeling from international criticism of its inability to stem massive leaks of contaminated water into the Pacific ocean, is deliberately playing down the risks. \"A task like this has never been done before, and obviously it is extremely dangerous,\" said Charles Perrow, an emeritus professor at Yale University. \"I would be reassured if experts from other nations were allowed to inspect the site, make recommendations and observe the process. Or better yet, do the work. Rather than damage the nation's pride, it would increase other nations' confidence in the ability of Tepco to handle the job.\" Shaun Burnie, a nuclear consultant, said Tepco had \"clearly demonstrated its inability\" to manage the cleanup. \"Does that mean they cannot be trusted to remove the fuel from Fukushima?\" he asked. \"That's irrelevant. They are going to remove the fuel and therefore the question is whether their plan is the best option without risk. \"They have to remove the fuel as early as possible – the risk from major structural failure leading to pool collapse is a greater threat than leaving the fuel in situ. \"The probability that the operation will go wrong in some way given the unique challenges and Tepco's track record must be considered a real risk.\" But Dale Klein, former chairman of the US nuclear regulatory commission and chair of Tepco's nuclear reform monitoring committee, said the removal of the spent fuel would be \"a milestone\". \"The engineers were very creative in building a new fuel-handling device for the spent fuel in No 4 pool,\" Klein said. Fuel removal is not the only challenge facing the 6,000 workers battling to make Fukushima Daiichi safe. Large areas of the plant are still a chaotic network of pipes and cables – reminders that this was the world's worst nuclear crisis in over a quarter of a century. The pipes carry water from the damaged reactors to a hanger-like decontamination facility, where dozens of radionuclides, including caesium, are removed. The 860-acre site is now home to more than 1,000 storage tanks, holding a combined 350,000 tons of contaminated water. Wooded areas are being cleared to make room for more tanks. Near the coastline, the rusty, mangled remains of vehicles swept up by the tsunami have been left exactly where the waves dumped them, while workers focus instead on bolstering the plant's defences against a possible future tsunami and trying to stem leaks of toxic water into the Pacific ocean. Even if all goes to plan, Tepco officials concede that securing reactor No 4 is only a first step: work to remove molten fuel from three neighbouring reactors that suffered meltdown won't begin for at least another six years. Radiation levels in those reactors are still too high for humans to enter, and attempts to use robots to determine the exact location of the melted fuel have failed. Instead, officials are placing their faith in the law of gravity, assuming only that the highly hazardous material lies somewhere deep inside the reactor basements. Given the potential dangers ahead, handling spent fuel rods could prove the least of Japan's nuclear worries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/feb/24/forget-cause-of-eating-disorders-promote-good-mental-health","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-24T16:40:10Z","webTitle":"Forget the 'cause' of eating disorders – we must promote good mental health | Daisy Buchanan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/24/forget-cause-of-eating-disorders-promote-good-mental-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/24/forget-cause-of-eating-disorders-promote-good-mental-health","fields":{"headline":"Forget the 'cause' of eating disorders – we must promote good mental health","bodyText":"Eating Disorders Awareness Week starts today, and charity Beat is working with Cosmopolitan magazine to campaign for doctors to take eating disorders more seriously, and to treat them before they get out of control. In the past year there has been an 8% rise in the number of admissions of patients being treated for eating disorders – most markedly among the under-15s, with some patients as young as five. And, according to research from mental health charities, there is an anorexia epidemic in Britain's independent schools, with girls from aspirational families thought to be the fastest growing group of sufferers. Following the recent fashion weeks in New York, London and Milan, I suspect that the finger is about to be pointed at the industry once more. It may be true that young girls idolise slender celebrities; an airbrushed picture in a magazine might be enough to make a healthy young woman ditch her dinner. Our problem with bodies is external, and so the solution must be too – but it isn't that simple. As a features writer for the teen magazine Bliss, I spoke to many young readers, male and female, about what it was like to live with an eating disorder, how it was triggered, how it developed, and how it affected the way they looked at life. Every single one had a different story. And mine was different again. I am a recovered anorexic, and although seeing pictures of Kate Moss on the catwalk has never helped my self-esteem, the fashion industry had no greater effect on my body confidence and eating patterns than the nuclear power one. When I was 12, like many children I started a new school. I thought I would love it. But the pressure to perform was intense, and the feeling that failure was not an option didn't do much for my mental health. Many girls in my year were starting to experience a form of disordered eating, now known as Ednos (eating disorder not otherwise specified). I had always loved food and been a bit bigger than my peers, but when everything around me seemed frightening and chaotic, skipping lunch proved I had power over my body and mind. My resolve to stay in control was stronger than my urge to lose weight. Puberty was frightening, my friends could be cruel, and my family were sometimes baffling – but my ability to avoid putting food into my body stayed consistent. I had begun to receive some bewildering attention as my hips and breasts started to emerge – but not eating took care of that. The theme common among the sufferers I know is the sense of powerlessness. When their lives seem chaotic, with no means to speak out or fix the problem that was making them sad, they took charge using one of the only methods available to them. And it is frustrating for them that people think the only way to end the problems caused by eating disorders is with a Whac-A-Mole approach, shutting down anything that might be considered dangerous or difficult without trying to get to the root of the problem and talking to teens about how they are feeling. When I was suffering from anorexia in the late 90s I didn't have access to a series of \"thinspiration Tumblrs\". However, when I was seriously ill I was energetically consuming every young adult novel and TV programme that discussed the disease. For young women currently in the grip of the illness these \"pro-ana\" sites are enormously attractive, offering comfort and community when you feel especially isolated – but you have to be deep in the grip of the disease before you seek them out. It is worth remembering that the sites are created by sufferers who need just as much compassion, help and support as their readers. Counselling helped me overcome anorexia – I was lucky that my school had an enlightened attitude to mental health. My compassionate therapist didn't try to guess my motives, but made me realise I was missing out on all sorts of teenage fun because I was so fixated on getting the most A*s and into the smallest jeans. There are many external factors that compound the causes of eating disorders. If you are depressed or anxious and have a complicated relationship with food, any material focusing on body image and weight loss might validate what you're doing. But this week, I hope we will all wake up to the fact that the prevention of eating disorders among young people lies in keeping them happy and mentally – as well as physically – healthy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/02/1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-02T10:57:31Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: IPCC climate report, rhino poaching record and wildlife comeback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/02/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/02/1","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: IPCC climate report, rhino poaching record and wildlife comeback","bodyText":"IPCC climate report • UN climate panel: 30 years to climate calamity if we carry on blowing the carbon budget • The digested read • IPCC report and reaction – as it happened • 'Carbon budget' talks urgent, warns Lord Stern • Interactive: how hot will it get in my lifetime? - interactive Environment news • Greenpeace activists charged with piracy by Russian authorities • BBC coverage of IPCC climate report criticised for sceptics' airtime • Rhino poaching hits new record in South Africa • Global warming can have a positive side, says Owen Paterson • Ikea to sell solar panels in UK stores • David Attenborough supports effort to save orangutan from extinction • BP returns to court over Deepwater Horizon spill as £11bn in fines loom On the blogs • US wakes up to illegal ivory trade • IPCC: Europe has been warming faster than the global average • Green NGOs cannot take big business cash and save planet • Natalie Bennett: The badger cull is disrupting wildlife and dividing communities • Owen Paterson v the science of climate change • Badger cull: the police and NFU are losing the battle • IPCC model global warming projections have done much better than you think • Beaver and bison among European species making a comeback Multimedia • Wildlife comeback in Europe - in pictures • The week in wildlife – in pictures • IPCC presents report on climate science - video • Tornado season: extreme weather in the US – in pictures Features and comment • Look, a badger – kill it! • False widow spider: small, deadly – and in the UK • How can I make sure my recycling isn't incinerated? • How Spain saved the lynx Best of the web • Tiger growl recordings deter crop-raiding Indian elephants • First US nuclear power closures in 15 years signal wider industry problems • Is US offshore wind power finally ready to take off? ...

The less good news is you will abandon the rest of Earth to certain doom and live in a mud burrow with only nerds for neighbours. Such are the quandaries that passengers will face if plans work out for an interstellar spaceship designed to serve as a lifeboat for Earth should the planet face disaster in the next century. Architects, designers and scientists have joined forces to explore the technologies needed to build a spacecraft that could be launched within the next 100 years and sustain human life for generations. Early designs for the ship envisage a giant 15km-wide ball filled with soil that will support complex ecosystems of microbes, plants and animal life. Rather than building homes on top of the soil, humans will live within, carving out rooms in a network of connected burrows. \"We need to think how we might live in space long term,\" said Rachel Armstrong, lead researcher on Project Persephone at of Greenwich University. \"So far, our approach to space has been very top-down. We take a vessel, put an environment in it, and off we go. For generational starships we need a different approach.\" Armstrong, a doctor-turned-architect, hopes to develop synthetic soils that are optimised to support life and recycle waste. Electronic circuits sowed throughout the soil could monitor biochemical activity and use organic signals to communicate with plants and microbes to reshape the ecosystem as it evolves. The goal is to make the spaceship self-sufficient, life-supporting and self-fuelling, perhaps by mining asteroids or scavenging materials from space junk. \"By asking these questions the project is challenging the industrial view of sustainability. It's all very fine to conserve energy and be considerate about polluting the environment, but is that actually sustainable? We want to build sustainable environments that promote life,\" Armstrong said. Urgency \"There's an urgency to this and the urgency is our own sustainable practices. I don't see my generation as being the ones that solve the starship [question]. It may be my grandchildren's generation that makes something qualitatively different from people who have only known an industrial era.\" The lessons learned from the project will have a more earthly impact long before any cosmic Noah's Ark has been built, by improving the sustainability of homes and cities, the researchers believe. Project Persephone has no central funding, but the team's studies are supported by individual grants secured by the researchers. The project is part of an international non-profit foundation called Icarus Interstellar, which is dedicated to starship research and development. Designing a self-sufficient, closed environment is a daunting task. In the 1990s, US \"crews\" tried twice to grow all their food and recycle waste and water at Biosphere 2 in Arizona. The missions faced a number of problems, including almost continuous hunger, falling oxygen levels, an explosion of cockroaches and ants, and a water filtration system clogged with dead fish. Armstrong concedes that humans might not turn out to be the best lifeforms to save when the end of Earth is nigh. \"We might decide that a giant microbial culture is all that the starship can support. We might have to have the humility to accept we're not the most likely to survive,\" she said. There are other challenges beyond generating enough food, water and air for a trip with no certain end. The spaceship will need to simulate gravity if humans and other life are to survive the voyage. And then there is the need for a radical and revolutionary propulsion system to blast the ship into space. These problems are the focus of other Icarus Interstellar projects. Though closer to the realm of science fiction than science fact, Icarus Interstellar are not the only ones with an eye on interstellar travel. In 2012, the US launched the 100 Year Starship, an ambitious project funded by Nasa and the government's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), to explore technologies needed to make interstellar space travel a reality a century from now. Richard Brown, director of the Centre for Future Air-Space Transport Technology at Strathclyde University, who is not involved in Persephone or the 100 Year Starship, said the projects could stimulate useful discussions. \"The more people are interested in these things, the more debate there is, and the more consideration we'll have of what humankind's future might be,\" he said. One of the greatest hurdles facing space exploration today is the cost of reaching Earth's orbit. To explore beyond the solar system, spacecraft might in future be built at orbiting manufacturing facilities. \"Once you are in Earth's orbit, you have solved half of the problem,\" Brown said. Catastrophe Steve Fuller, a sociologist at Warwick University who works on Persephone, said the project was one of several that takes seriously the idea that humanity may face a global catastrophe in the not too distant future. \"The project is trying to put in some safeguards so that humanity can survive somewhere else. \"This is a different kind of spaceship from the ones we are used to. It isn't necessarily designed to come back to Earth. We're talking about a spaceship that a new generation of people would be born on. There might be people who live their entire lives in this place,\" he said. The project's researchers have not nailed down the precise global catastrophes that might warrant the launch of a giant spaceship to save life as we know it. But beyond who decides when to abandon Earth, is the thorny question of who would get a seat on board. Armstrong said a ball-shaped spaceship 15km across might support 50 to 500 people, a tiny fraction of the Earth's 7 billion-strong population. \"Who are you going to take? They are going to look for diversity, and high-end skilled people,\" said Fuller. \"You're not going to take people who lack skills. You're not going to take homeless people, though that's not official policy.\" Faced with the prospect of living out their years in a mud burrow with no one but scientists and engineers for company, some may prefer to take their chances on Earth. \"Some people will say we wouldn't be in this situation if it wasn't for science and technology and these clever clogs who gave us the industrial revolution and nuclear power, let them go and find their own planet,\" said Fuller."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/jun/20/britain-took-more-out-of-india","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-20T17:00:00Z","webTitle":"Britain took more out of India than it put in – could China do the same to Britain? | Ian Jack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/20/britain-took-more-out-of-india","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/20/britain-took-more-out-of-india","fields":{"headline":"Britain took more out of India than it put in – could China do the same to Britain?","bodyText":"According to an editorial published in China's Global Times to coincide with this week's London visit of premier Li Keqiang, the British live in \"an old, declining empire\" that, like some drooling elderly relative, needs the patience and understanding of rising nations such as China. Last year, during David Cameron's trip to Beijing, the same paper announced that Britain was \"just an old European country apt [that is, suitable] for travel and study\". As the Global Times is an offshoot of the Chinese Communist party's official newspaper, the People's Daily, we can assume its blunt diagnosis reflects the governmental view. The present tense – \"declining\" rather than \"former\" or \"sunken\" – suggests an overestimate of Britain's status on the part of the writer, but perhaps only in the negative sense that its downward journey isn't yet quite complete. We have been preparing for such moments for more than a century, since that July morning in 1897, at the height of Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee, when readers of the Times found on its leader page Rudyard Kipling's admonitory poem Recessional, which called for British humility and God's mercy in the light of the fact that no empire lasts for ever. \"Lo, all our pomp of yesterday/ Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!\" And yet for most of its postwar history Britain managed to compensate for – even to disguise – its downward global trajectory by spreading its wealth more equally, putting on magnificent royal pageants and, arguably more than any other nation, embracing the cult of youth. An inquisitive teenager in the 1960s might fret with his parents over the shedding of fleets and factories, but he was much more likely to be lost in Tolkien, CND or the Beatles' new LP. It has taken 50 years of economic impotence and political wrong-headedness for the eventual consequence to emerge in the landscape: the rundown post-industrial settlements that have had their public funding cut, where town halls, shops, courts, police stations, post offices and local newspapers are closed or closing, stripping the place (as the Labour MP Jamie Reed wrote this week) of every symbol of permanence, community strength and civic identity, and forcing the more able individuals to up sticks and get out. But the fate of Nineveh and Tyre, the ancient cities of the Assyrians and Phoenicians, doesn't seem quite the right historical precedent for towns such as Burnley and Paisley. A closer parallel is Bengal, the Indian province whose economy was destroyed by the technological strength of northern Britain in what the writer Jeremy Seabrook has called \"the first great de-industrialisation of the modern world\". For at least two centuries the handloom weavers of Bengal produced some of the world's most desirable fabrics, especially the fine muslins, light as \"woven air\", that were in such demand for dressmaking and so cheap that Britain's own cloth manufacturers conspired to cut off the fingers of Bengali weavers and break their looms. Their import was ended, however, by the imposition of duties and a flood of cheap fabric – cheaper even than poorly paid Bengali artisans could provide – from the new steam mills of northern England and lowland Scotland that conquered the Indian as well the British market. India still grew cotton, but Bengal no longer spun or wove much of it. Weavers became beggars, while the population of Dhaka, which was once the great centre of muslin production, fell from several hundred thousand in 1760 to about 50,000 by the 1820s. Tigers and leopards roamed the streets. Seabrook gives a memorable picture of dereliction: \"The city of men had become a city of animals. Weavers' dwellings were overgrown, the thatch alive with birds, snakes and insects, while roussettes – bats small and multi-coloured as butterflies – flew in and out of earth-mounds that had been homes; hunched vultures surveyed tracts of land in which the human voice was stilled. People lost the skill of their fingers, and only the roughest-made country cloth still found a market among the poorest.\" Subsequently, India became the exporter of raw materials and foodstuffs – raw cotton and jute, coal, opium, rice, spice and tea – rather than manufactured goods. British shareholders could also make money by investing in Indian infrastructure, principally the railways, where the Indian government attracted funds by guaranteeing returns on capital of 5% net per year. If the railway company couldn't achieve that return on its own, then the government made up the shortfall from its revenues, which came from Indian and not British taxes. In the event, it was 20 years before the first lines earned more than 5% of their capital outlay, but that did nothing to inhibit their extravagant spending: a mile of Indian railway cost double the same distance in the equally difficult terrain of Canada and Australia. It was a splendid racket for everyone, apart from the Indian taxpayer. In terms of a secure return, Indian railway shares offered twice as much as the British government's own stock. Guaranteed railway shares absorbed up to a fifth of British portfolio investment in the 20 years to 1870 – the first line opened in 1853 – but only 1% of it originated in India. Most of the rest came from small shareholders with addresses in southern England: from bankers, barristers, spinsters, retired army officers and people known simply as \"gentlemen\". Their holdings averaged only £1,500, but the total invested meant that India's railways represented one of the 19th century's largest flows of money between continents. India got an expansive railway system far in advance of any other Asian nation, but Britain retained its grip on the technology as the supplier of all its equipment, which meant once again that the profits were repatriated. The English economist William Thomas Thornton, who was secretary of public works at the India Office, described the guaranteed scheme in a phrase that became well known. It was, he said, \"private enterprise at public risk\". When arguments began to be made for Indian independence, it was also evidence for the idea that Britain took more out of its most magnificent colony than it put in. Colonialism no longer flies a flag or sends gunboats, but its underlying economic facts may not have changed very much. China is on its way to becoming the world's most industrially powerful country, the position that Britain enjoyed when it crushed Bengal's textile industry and built India's railways. According to the trade deals announced this week between China and the UK, China will now build and operate Britain's forthcoming high-speed railway. It will also build, own and operate the first in a new series of nuclear power stations. China needs ever-increasing supplies of food and raw material, and markets for its manufactures. Britain can't supply the first, but it can supply titbits for China's new rich – whisky, salmon, Jaguars – and allow Chinese engineers and technology to have charge of Britain's most important new infrastructure. David Cameron sees these developments in an interesting way – that Britain is \"playing a part in the rise of China\" by helping economic growth to lift millions of its citizens out of poverty. Perhaps this is his altruism coming out. Certainly no impoverished weaver in Bengal would have taken a similar view in 1800. \"How pleased we are to have helped the British Empire by pointing thousands of England's rural labourers towards the smoke of Manchester, where their power looms have made us redundant.\" No, that doesn't work.

What happened at Hemsby, and also along the coast at Happisburgh, was extreme. But not unprecedented. \"O Tide that waits for no man / Spare our coasts!\" sing the Suffolk fishing villagers in Britten's 1945 opera Peter Grimes, and, over the next 50 years from now, hundreds more homes could be claimed by rising water, inland as well as coastal. The task of holding back the floods is overwhelming the capacity to do it. The question for government is how far and how fast it is going to retreat. The floods on the Somerset Levels have already lasted a month, and are not over yet. They show just how tough addressing this issue will be. The Levels are a manmade environment that has been managed so ingeniously for 2,000 years that the area now supports towns, countless farms and villages, a motorway, railway lines and even a nuclear power station. Over the centuries, the sea has occasionally surged inland, but flooding from rivers has always been a regular winter event. What has changed is that local people feel that they have become collateral damage in a plan in which they have had no voice. At the weekend, David Cameron told the local newspaper: \"We will sort this out.\" It is a promise he is unlikely to be able to keep. Some things he can do: he can redress the deep cuts in funding of 2010 so that the Environment Agency can afford both to invest in new flood defences and, as importantly, maintain existing ones. Other things have already been done: the military and emergency services are offering the limited help they can while the rivers are too full to carry away the flood water. Local councils may get some extra help. But the weather and the tides are beyond political control. Progress, which for so long has been about dominating the forces of nature, is now going to involve some accommodation with it. Climate scientists are in no doubt that this kind of flooding – and last month's coastal erosion – is only going to become more frequent. Coping with it will involve more and better defences. But it will also mean retreat. That will work best if it comes from bottom-up planning: the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, was right to challenge people on the Levels to come up with their own proposals to make their livelihoods sustainable. Some already have: but the Parrett catchment project, completed five years ago, now appears to exist only in academic studies. A plea to revive it after last year's flooding got no response. At the end of last week, the Somerset Drainage Boards Consortium unveiled its proposals in response to the Paterson challenge. It recognises that there is no single solution and that keeping life on the Levels sustainable won't come cheap, even though the dredging that people have been demanding for years is only a part of an answer. The plan also involves investment on a sluice gate near the mouth of the Parrett to stop high tides flooding upstream, blocking the water coming down. There would have to be work on the uplands to slow the flow on to the Levels. Farmers need help to improve their flood resilience. But even with all of this, the plan bluntly says, it will not be possible to restore the status quo. In the next few years, some of the most vulnerable homes, and some farmland, will have to be given up. That is a hard conclusion to draw and accept, and it's certainly not a decision to be taken under the duress of the kind of extreme weather the Levels have endured for weeks past. There has to be careful planning in which everyone feels they have had a fair hearing. Central government – and in particular the Environment Agency – needs to listen. Local government needs to engage, as it already is, facilitating land swaps, underwriting short-term mortgages, easing the passage to a more sustainable future.

The cheapest and least risky route to dealing with global warming is to abandon all dirty fossil fuels in coming decades, the report found. Gas – including that from the global fracking boom – could be important during the transition, Edenhofer said, but only if it replaced coal burning. The authoritative report, produced by 1,250 international experts and approved by 194 governments, dismisses fears that slashing carbon emissions would wreck the world economy. It is the final part of a trilogy that has already shown that climate change is “unequivocally” caused by humans and that, unchecked, it poses a grave threat to people and could lead to wars and mass migration. Diverting hundred of billions of dollars from fossil fuels into renewable energy and cutting energy waste would shave just 0.06% off expected annual economic growth rates of 1.6%-3%, the IPCC report concluded. “The report is clear: the more you wait, the more it will cost [and] the more difficult it will become,” said EU commissioner Connie Hedegaard. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said: “This report is a wake-up call about global economic opportunity we can seize today as we lead on climate change.” The UK’s energy and climate secretary, Ed Davey, said: “The [report shows] the tools we need to tackle climate change are available, but international efforts need to significantly increase.” The IPCC economic analysis did not include the benefits of cutting greenhouse gas emissions, which could outweigh the costs. The benefits include reducing air pollution, which plagues China and recently hit the UK, and improved energy security, which is currently at risk in eastern Europe due to the actions of Russia – a large producer of gas – in Ukraine. The new IPCC report warns that carbon emissions have soared in the last decade and are now growing at almost double the previous rate. But its comprehensive analysis found rapid action can still limit global warming to 2C, the internationally agreed safe limit, if low-carbon energy triples or quadruples by 2050. “It is actually affordable to do it and people are not going to have to sacrifice their aspirations about improved standards of living,” said Professor Jim Skea, an energy expert at Imperial College London and co-chair of the IPCC report team. “It is not a hair shirt change of lifestyle at all that is being envisaged and there is space for poorer countries to develop too,” Skea told the Guardian. Nonetheless, to avoid the worst impacts of climate change at the lowest cost, the report envisages an energy revolution ending centuries of dominance by fossil fuels – which will require significant political and commercial change. On Thursday, Archbishop Desmond Tutu called for an anti-apartheid style campaign against fossil fuel companies, which he blames for the “injustice” of climate change. Friends of the Earth’s executive director, Andy Atkins, said: “Rich nations must take the lead by rapidly weaning themselves off coal, gas and oil and funding low-carbon growth in poorer countries.” Along with measures that cut energy waste, renewable energy – such as wind, hydropower and solar – is viewed most favourably by the report as a result of its falling costs and large-scale deployment in recent years. The report includes nuclear power as a mature low-carbon option, but cautions that it has declined globally since 1993 and faces safety, financial and waste-management concerns. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) – trapping the CO2 from coal or gas burning and then burying it – is also included, but the report notes it is an untested technology on a large scale and may be expensive. Biofuels, used in cars or power stations, could play a “critical role” in cutting emissions, the IPCC found, but it said the negative effects of some biofuels on food prices and wildlife remained unresolved. The report found that current emission-cutting pledges by the world’s nations make it more likely than not that the 2C limit will be broken and it warns that delaying action any further will increase the costs. Delay could also force extreme measures to be taken including sucking CO2 out of the air. This might be done by generating energy by burning plants and trees, which had absorbed carbon from the atmosphere, and then using CCS to bury the emissions. But the IPCC warned such warned such carbon removal technologies may never be developed and could bring new risks. “This is a very responsible report,” said Professor Andrew Watson, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Exeter who was not part of the IPCC team. He said there were economic and social risks in transforming the energy system to cut carbon. “However, there are even bigger risks if we do nothing and rely exclusively on being able to ride out climate change and adapt to it.” Environmental campaign groups, which have previously criticised the IPCC for being too conservative, welcomed the new report. WWF’s Samantha Smith said: “The IPCC report makes clear that acting on emissions now is affordable, but delaying further increases the costs. It is a super strong signal to [fossil fuel] investors: they can no longer say they did not know the risks.” Kaisa Kosonen, at Greenpeace International, said: “Renewable energy is unstoppable. It’s becoming bigger, better and cheaper every day. Dirty energy industries are sure to put up a fight but it’s only a question of time before public pressure and economics dictate that they either change or go out of business.” • This article was amended on 27 May 2015 to correct a figure from the IPCC report."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"big-energy-debate/energy-provider-pressure-consumers-price-companies","type":"article","sectionId":"big-energy-debate","sectionName":"The big energy debate","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-24T08:45:00Z","webTitle":"You tell us: what do you want from an energy provider?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/big-energy-debate/energy-provider-pressure-consumers-price-companies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/big-energy-debate/energy-provider-pressure-consumers-price-companies","fields":{"headline":"You tell us: what do you want from an energy provider?","bodyText":"Billy Ahmed, 20, hospitality worker: 'Allow us to roll on bills' I live in a shared house with four other housemates, and sometimes deciding who pays the bills or who's responsible for the direct debit can cause a lot of problems. We just switched our gas and electricity bill from pay as you go to a standing order; on reflection it was much easier before, because at least you didn't have to chase people for money they owe. I haven't noticed the rise in energy prices, but what would be good is if energy companies would allow you to roll on unpaid bills, which might make getting cash out of housemates a bit less stressful. Eleanor May, 23, service industry manager: 'Let's pay monthly' I live in a house with one other person, and it's a nightmare to heat and the bills are enormous. At the moment we're paying our bills quarterly, which isn't something we wanted. We've tried changing it to a monthly, but the energy company won't let us – they said we have to pay either quarterly or every four months. I don't know how much of a difference that makes in terms of price, but it would make things a lot easier for us to budget if we were allowed pay monthly, because it's simpler to work out what we need to save. David Saunders, 64, technology consultant: 'Stop cosying up to power' The way politicians have framed this issue doesn't help. The problem is that despite supposedly having a free market, energy bosses and MPs still like to cosy up to one another. Also, energy prices are going to be the last thing people worry about when we inevitably reach the stage when water is becoming scarce. Regardless, this talk about nationalisation of energy doesn't help – it comes from all over the world. One novel solution to the political issue would be to start counting spoilt votes, to see just how disenfranchised we are with our elites. But with regards to the energy issue? We're at the mercy of large corporations, and they're even more impenetrable than small governments. Marie Bridges, 40, educationalist: 'Pick up the telephone' My main issue is that when you have a problem with your gas or electricity service or have a query about your bill, you can never speak to someone directly about it. I know call centres are part and parcel of the modern age, but I don't find it reassuring that when I need to speak to someone, often you end up discussing it with someone who has no expertise. Also it would be good if more was done to utilise green energy, such as wind farms or solar energy – anything to keep the cost of the bills down. Michelle Kirana Oh, 26, designer: 'Keep offering a cheap fixed price' I rent my own business premises with other people and the gas bill is always pretty cheap. It's never more than £30 a month, so that's fine. And the bill for my flat that I share with my boyfriend is usually about £44 a month, so again, that's fairly affordable. Our home is relatively new and has few rooms, so this could be why it's so inexpensive. Nonetheless, we haven't really felt the pinch of rising energy costs. When they went up last year, we changed to a lower fixed tariff, which we're tied to for 12 months. But it's cheaper than what we were paying before, so we're happy. Rasha Kahil, 34, magazine editor: 'Don't underestimate estimates' I share a flat with two friends, and last winter it was so cold and we were so fed up of splitting bills that we switched to an estimated flat rate for that quarter, and just left it at that. When the actual bill arrived, it was considerably more than what we'd paid as an estimate, leaving me with a shortfall in cash. It's annoying. Our flat is in London and these expensive energy prices feel like just another punitive tax for living in the capital alongside rent prices, travel cards and living costs. Phil Johnstone, 27, researcher: 'Keep investing in gas' The plan to solve the energy crisis with new nuclear power stations seems misguided. It doesn't look like they're going to go online until 2023, and similar models being built in Europe have gone vastly over budget. Moreover, they haven't generated the energy they were expected to so, inevitably, we're going to need more gas anyway. Paul McGuinness, 30, legal aide: 'Set out a Scottish offer' Our energy bills just keep getting more and more expensive. Our last quarterly bill for gas and electricity was £250. I'm from Ireland but I live in Glasgow, and all the houses I've lived in here seem to have had huge, single-pane windows and been poorly insulated. Energy prices would therefore be something that might encourage me to vote in the Scottish independence referendum, if one of the parties were to begin explicitly addressing this issue. At the moment I don't intend to vote because I don't consider it's my place, but this issue might sway me – and other voters who are unsure.

The report produced by hundreds of experts and backed by almost 200 world governments, will detail the dramatic transformation required of the entire globe's power system, including ending centuries of coal, oil and gas supremacy. Currently fossil fuels provide more than 80% of all energy but the urgent need to cut planet-warming carbon emissions means this must fall to as little as a third of present levels in coming decades, according to a leaked draft of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report seen by the Guardian. There is heavy emphasis on renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, and cutting energy waste, which together need hundreds of billions of dollars of investment a year. But despite the scale of the challenge, the draft report is upbeat: \"Since [2007], many renewable energy technologies have substantially advanced in terms of performance and cost and a growing number have achieved technical and economic maturity, making renewable energy a fast growing category in energy supply,\" the report says. It also highlights that the benefits of clean energy, particularly in reducing deadly air pollution and providing secure energy supplies, \"outweigh the adverse side effects\". The IPCC report is the last part of a trilogy compiled by thousands of the world's most eminent scientists which gives the most definitive account of climate change to date. The first report, released in September, showed climate change was \"unequivocally\" caused by human activity and prompted Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, to say: \"The heat is on. Now we must act.\" The second, published in March, warned that the impact of global warming, from extreme weather to reduced food production, posed a grave threat to humanity and could lead to wars and mass migration. The International Energy Agency said the IPCC's work showed \"the urgent need of enabling a global transition to clean energy systems\". The report will address how to avert the worst dangers by cutting carbon emissions, which have been rising despite the global recession of 2007-08. Nuclear power is cited among the low-carbon energy sources needed, but the draft report warns it \"has been declining since 1993\" and faces concerns about \"safety, nuclear weapon proliferation risks, waste management security as well as financial and regulatory risks\". Another way to produce low-carbon energy is to burn fossil fuels but capture and bury the carbon emissions. The IPCC experts note that, unlike renewable energy, this technology \"has not yet been applied at a large, commercial scale\". The draft report concludes that increasing carbon emissions are due to rising coal use, along with increasing demand for energy from the world's growing population. But it notes that policies implemented to cut carbon emissions will also cut the value of fossil fuel reserves, particularly for coal. It also says increased use of gas could cut emissions in the \"short term\", if it replaces coal. China's vast coal burning represents a huge challenge but a new analysis from Greenpeace, published on Friday, suggests it may have reached a turning point. \"The range of coal caps and anti-smog measures put in place by the Chinese authorities could see the country cut its carbon emissions by more than twice the UK's annual footprint by 2020, making it possible for global carbon levels to peak before climate change spirals out of control,\" said Li Shuo, Greenpeace East Asia's climate and energy campaigner. On Thursday, Nobel peace prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu called in the Guardian for an anti-apartheid-style campaign against fossil fuel companies. \"It is clear that [the companies] are not simply going to give up; they stand to make too much money,\" he wrote. Over half a trillion dollars a year are spent subsidising fossil fuels – six times more than spent supporting renewable energy – and US president Barack Obama and other leaders have pledged to phase these out. The draft IPCC report states this could be done without harming the poor: \"Many countries have reformed their tax and budget systems to reduce fuel subsidies, that actually accrue to the relatively wealthy, and used other mechanisms that are more targeted to the poor.\" The draft report runs counter to some of the UK's key energy policies. It states that decarbonising electricity is key to cost-effective cuts in emissions, but the coalition government voted down a plan to do this by 2030. The report also warns that building high-carbon energy infrastructure developments will lock societies into high emissions and may be \"difficult or very costly to change\", but UK ministers are strongly pushing shale gas exploration. The UK's carbon plan includes significant burning of biofuels and biomass (usually wood), which is supposed to be carbon neutral. But the IPCC report says scientific debate about whether biofuels cut emissions \"remains unresolved\" and that without policy safeguards \"large scale bioenergy deployment could increase emissions\". Friends of the Earth's executive director, Andy Atkins, said: \"We can only avoid catastrophic climate change if we reduce our dependency on fossil fuels – we're already on track for four degrees warming, which will be impossible for human society to adapt to. We have the technology to prevent dangerous climate change. What we lack is the political will of our leaders to strongly champion renewable power and energy efficiency.\" Li said: \"We stand at a fork in road. One way leads to more dependence on dwindling fossil fuels that are wrecking our climate and damaging our health; the other to a world powered by a booming clean energy sector that is already driving growth and creating jobs. The sooner we act, the cheaper it will be.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2013/oct/31/dark-tourism-murder-sites-disaster-zones","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-31T14:58:07Z","webTitle":"Dark tourism: why murder sites and disaster zones are proving popular with travellers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/oct/31/dark-tourism-murder-sites-disaster-zones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2013/oct/31/dark-tourism-murder-sites-disaster-zones","fields":{"headline":"Dark tourism: why murder sites and disaster zones are proving popular","bodyText":"When it comes to holiday jaunts, the site of a nuclear disaster zone, the home of a serial killer or the execution chamber of a former state prison don't scream \"wish you were here\". But while it might not be everyone's idea of fun, demand for macabre attractions and disturbing experiences that recreate horrific moments in history is growing – dark tourism is on the rise. Last month the Sacramento Old City Association opened the home of notorious 1980s Californian serial killer Dorothea Puente for a tour that included pointing out the spot in the garden where her victim's bodies were buried. This spring, the notorious Missouri State Penitentiary, nicknamed \"the bloodiest 47 acres in America\", opened to visitors with a chance to see the gas chamber once used for executions. And there are currently plans underway to turn the disaster site of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into a tourist destination. In the case of the latter, radiation levels mean it will be at least 25 years before the site could possibly open to the public. Places such as Auschwitz-Birkenau, the Cambodian killing fields and Ground Zero are some of the best known destinations that fall under the dark tourism category. But Dr Philip Stone, executive director of the Institute for Dark Tourism Research at the University of Central Lancashire, which was founded last year, says dark tourism is any travel associated with death, disaster or the macabre. \"It's the commercialisation of death,\" he explains. \"Take the Flight 93 crash site. Soon after it happened farmers were selling tours of the field. But now there's an established memorial. There's been a process of commercialisation from that initial demand to becoming a formal destination.\" As well as the well-known sites of memorial and human tragedy, there are increasing opportunities for travellers to immerse themselves in unpleasant experiences of the past. In Vietnam, visitors to the Cu Chi tunnels, used during the Vietnam war, are invited to crawl around inside, while above ground a firing range offers the chance to use an AK47 – the weapon of the choice for the Viet Cong army. This week photographer Ina Fassbender reported on her experience of spending the night in a former Stasi bunker in East Germany. The bunker museum at Rennsteighoehe offers a \"reality experience\", where visitors can spend a gruelling 16 hours dressed as and being treated like a former DDR soldier. Some of the \"officers\" leading the tour actually were soldiers during the Cold War. Similarly, in Latvia, the Karosta Prision, now a hotel, invites guests to be a prisoner for the day. Before being shown to your cell, guests must sign an agreement allowing them to be insulted and treated like a prisoner. If you disobey orders guards can be force you to do physical exercise or cleaning jobs. Recently, the behaviour of some people at dark tourism destinations came under scrutiny when Jason Feifer, a journalist from New York, began re-posting tourists' inappropriate self portraits, or \"selfies\". The Selfies at Serious Places tumblr account features one teenager doing a thumbs up at the holocaust memorial in Berlin. \"I think most people are going to these places with a purity of curiosity,\" says Feifer, who hoped the blog would start a discussion around the issue. \"I work opposite Ground Zero and I watch tourists taking photos. People take selfies there. It's funny. People just want to capture a moment down there and they don't know how to do it.\" One tourist who featured on Heifer's blog is Jake Fletcher, a 20-year-old student from Hull. He is pictured open-mouthed in front of the Chernobyl nuclear power station. He doesn't regret taking the photo, but the experience has fuelled his interest in dark tourist destinations. \"Normal beach holidays can't compare to the experience I had at Chernobyl,\" he says. \"It's one of a handful of places on Earth that you could actually call a dystopia. While you're there you do get a strange feeling. I felt a sense of gladness that myself and my family haven't had to experience horrors like those in Chernobyl.\" For Mark Watson, executive director of ethical travel campaign group, Tourism Concern, there's not a clear cut answer to whether dark tourism is right or wrong. \"People go for a huge variety of reasons, so it's very difficult to assess their motivations,\" he says. \"At places like Auswchitz and the Rwandan Genocide Memorial, people go to really understand what happened and are genuinely moved by it. You've got to look at the impact on the communities and understand the local sensitivities. It shouldn't be a case of blundering in and taking some photos.\" But despite the uncomfortable nature of dark tourism, it seems to be something most of us will have engaged with at one point in our lives. \"Dark tourism doesn't need dark tourists,\" says Stone. \"It just needs people who are interested in learning about this life and this world.\" Five dark tourism sites Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, Cambodia: At a former high school that was used by the Khmer Rouge as the notorious S-21 prison during the 70s, visitors can walk through cells still containing the rusted chairs and beds where as many as 20,000 prisoners were tortured and killed. Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, Japan: Dedicated to the memories of the 140,000 direct and indirect victims of the nuclear attack on Japan, the memorial park includes the skeletal ruins of the building now known as the A-Bomb Dome – the closest building to the centre of the explosion to remain standing. Auschwitz Birkenau, Poland: The concentration and extermination camp where approximately one million European Jews were murdered by the Nazis. Each year over a million people visit the site, to reflect upon and learn about the events of the holocaust. Hoi An, Vietnam: Tourists visiting the city of Hoi An can book tours to the nearby site of the My Lai Massacre, where hundreds of women and children were brutally murdered by US soldiers during the Vietnam war. Robben Island Prison Museum, South Africa: For over three centuries, Robben Island, just off the coast of Cape Town, was used to hold political prisoners.

The result represented an overwhelming setback for the prime minister, who had tried to thwart the outcome by discouraging Italians from taking part. The referendum needed a turnout of at least 50% to be binding. Interior ministry figures projections indicated that more than 57% of the electorate had taken part. Greenpeace called it a historic result. Quorums were also reached in three other referendums held simultaneously – the first time in 16 years that a quorum had been achieved in any referendum in Italy. Official projections showed more than 95% of voters rejecting water privatisation and a law allowing Berlusconi and other ministers to cite government business as a reason for delaying trials in which they were defendants. The expected majority against nuclear power was 94%. For the prime minister it represented a second, bitter setback in under two weeks. His government, which yokes his Freedom People movement to the regionalist and Islamophobic Northern League, first ran into serious trouble on 30 May when his candidate for mayor of Milan lost in a local election runoff. Milan is Berlusconi's home city and traditionally a weather-vane accurately pointing to Italy's future political direction. Acknowledging defeat even before the polls closed, Berlusconi said: \"We shall probably have to say goodbye to nuclear [energy].\" He told a press conference in Rome that his government would now throw all its energy into developing renewable sources. The outcome was a huge success for the anti-nuclear movement in the world's first nationwide vote on the issue since Japan's Fukushima disaster. The ballot was also the latest, and most persuasive, evidence that a majority of Italians have turned against their flamboyant prime minister. The government, which appealed to the courts for the vote to be scrapped, did all it could to keep turnout low. Berlusconi boycotted the vote and Italian television, largely under his sway, almost ignored the approaching ballots until the final days of a poorly funded, low-profile campaign. Following the defeat in Milan, many rank-and-file Northern League supporters have been urging their leader, Umberto Bossi, to cut himself free of Berlusconi. The party leadership has so far remained wedded to the coalition while pressing for a radical change in economic policy that would deliver tax cuts to its lower middle-class electoral base. But as the results of the two-day ballot became known on Monday, it was clear that even some of the League's top officials were losing patience. Roberto Calderoli, a cabinet minister, said: \"In the local elections two weeks ago we took the first hit. Now, with the referendum, has come the second. I would not like taking hits to become a habit.\" Italy abandoned its nuclear programme following a similar referendum in 1987. The government of the day opted to phase out all the country's existing plants. The last one shut down in 1990. Berlusconi had planned to generate a quarter of Italy's electricity with French-built nuclear plants. Construction of the first was due to start between 2013 and 2015. Vittorio Cogliati Dezza, president of the environmental organisation Legambiente, said: \"The era of nuclear [energy] is coming to an end today. Definitively. A new season of development for the country is beginning.\" Recalling Italy's first and most famous legislative referendum in 1974, when voters were asked whether divorce should be outlawed, the leader of the biggest opposition group, Pier Luigi Bersani of the Democratic party, said the latest ballot had also been a referendum on divorce. But this time, said Bersani, it was about \"the divorce between the government and the country\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/mar/17/benn-crow-twitter-death-ritual-absurd-praise","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-17T21:07:22Z","webTitle":"Tony Benn, Bob Crow: the true mark of greatness is to avoid Twitter's death ritual | John Harris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/17/benn-crow-twitter-death-ritual-absurd-praise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/17/benn-crow-twitter-death-ritual-absurd-praise","fields":{"headline":"Tony Benn, Bob Crow: the true mark of greatness is to avoid Twitter's death ritual","bodyText":"By the end of last Tuesday, Bob Crow had turned into Princess Diana. To question his life and legacy was to come dangerously close to moral indecency – and anyway, who could argue that he was in fact a proud and principled example to us all? \"Bob Crow was a fighter and a force,\" said Nick Clegg. \"Didn't always agree with him but he was a man of principle and said what he thought,\" reckoned Labour's Chuka Umunna, confirming the idea that politicians of his standing do actually think in cliches. \"Bob Crow was a doughty and committed advocate for his members,\" offered the director general of the CBI, now a proud brother in struggle. Boris Johnson said that Crow was \"slightly misunderstood by the wider public, if I might say so\", to which the obvious answer was: no, you might not. For London's mayor had not only long refused to meet the RMT leader, but only a month before rather encouraged the public to misunderstand him by making hay with Crow's supposedly hypocritical cruise trip and accusing him of \"holding a gun\" to the head of the capital? Then came the death of Tony Benn, and true absurdity. First, a great line of modern Labour politicians hammering at their smartphones, 90% of whom embody – whether rightly or wrongly – a kind of progressive politics that has been washed of all traces of what Benn represented. \"Tony Benn was a powerful, fearless, relentless advocate for social justice and people's rights,\" raved Gordon Brown, who reckoned he would \"continue to have a profound influence on generations to come\" (even though Benn once said Brown was \"unfit to run a corner shop\"). A few places back in the queue was Stephen Twigg, whose mercifully brief spell as shadow education secretary perhaps underlined the drawbacks of politics completely free of ideology. \"Tony Benn was a true political giant – hearing him speak at a public meeting when I was 15 was what made me join the Labour party,\" he said. Really? \"The final corruption of radical politics is that you become a sort of well-loved eccentric, seen at parties,\" Benn wrote in his diaries. Posthumously, his worst fears came true – as evidenced by additional tweeted tributes from such notables as Stephen Fry, Gary Lineker, Simon Pegg, and Arlene Phillips, who had lately seen him \"walking around Belsize Park\". Such is one of the more surreal aspects of modern discourse, which lends itself to an amusing parlour game. Take a random celeb and an equally random issue or news event, and you're off: who fancies Ken Hom's views on Scottish independence, or what Mick Hucknall makes of the fate of that Malaysian airliner? Is the key difficulty here the medium or the message? In other words – quite apart from the fact that social media self-evidently encourages the madness of crowds – given that Twitter now sits at the heart of the modern death ritual, is the fact that the complexities of lives have to be squeezed into 140 characters the source of the problem? Or does the fact that so many people have embraced that means of communication reflect what little time human beings have for nuance and complexity anyway? Whatever, if we have always had a tendency to respond to others' passing with cant and silliness – don't speak ill of the dead, and all that – that variety of behaviour is now going nuclear. Can you imagine what would have happened if Twitter was around when John Lennon was shot? What great blizzards of nonsense will eventually mark the deaths of Bob Dylan, Bill Clinton, John Major or David Bowie? And might it be the mark of true greatness to breathe your last and somehow escape all this, remaining as controversial in death as in life? That certainly applied to Margaret Thatcher. It will also surely be true of Arthur Scargill. And, come to think of it, Tony Blair. Benn, it seems to me, was thoroughly decent, personable and sometimes inspirational, a man whose essential values were beyond reproach. Beyond that, ambivalence takes hold. He and his followers played much the biggest role in ensuring that the Labour party spent much of the Thatcher years in a mire of unelectability. He was no less capable than other politicians of shameless about-turns, as anyone who followed his volte-face on nuclear power would know. Circa 1985, in holding fast to the old maxim \"no enemies on the left\" and supporting the presence of Trotskyist wreckers in the Labour party, he rather did my head in – because I was fighting a gaggle of them who had moved into my constituency, hell-bent on taking over an essentially meaningless little branch of the Labour Party Young Socialists by being as unpleasant to other people as possible. I could say more, but that's the basis of what flipped through my brain last Friday: 857 characters, which kind of makes my point. On a different subject, it may be worth pointing out that though, as Ken Livingstone observed, Bob Crow did indeed ensure that tube drivers are the only well-paid working-class people in London, he paid far too little attention to modern trade unionism's most pressing task: the need to defy a stereotype of stubborn, intransigent white men, and present a slightly more sympathetic face to the world. Am I allowed to say that yet? Given that the most rousing lines in the Internationale include \"Away with all your superstitions\", I would hope so."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/nov/28/nuclear-uk-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-28T10:04:00Z","webTitle":"UK's faith in nuclear power threatens renewables, says German energy expert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/28/nuclear-uk-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/nov/28/nuclear-uk-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"UK's faith in nuclear power threatens renewables, says German energy expert","bodyText":"Building new nuclear power stations will make it harder for the UK to switch to renewable energy, said one of the top German officials leading the country's nuclear energy phase-out. Germany said shortly after the Fukushima disaster in March that it would phase out its nuclear plants by 2022, while the UK is planning to build eight new nuclear plants as well as massively increase the amount of energy generated from wind power. But Jochen Flasbarth, president of the Environmental Protection Agency in Germany, who advises the German government, said: \"We are not missionaries, and every country will have to find its own way in energy policy, but it is obvious that nuclear plants are too inflexible and cannot sufficiently respond to variations in wind or solar generation, only gas [power stations] do.\" Flasbarth robustly defended Germany's nuclear phase-out, saying it would be smoother than critics think. \"The phase-out is doable and I don't expect unsolvable problems,\" he told the Guardian in an interview. \"I wonder why Germany feels the pressure to defend its decision, but not the countries who stick to nuclear energy, which has been proved to be unsustainable.\" He said he did not expect power shortages and it would not be necessary to import nuclear power from neighbouring countries such as the Czech Republic. \"During the last month, there was no need for electricity imports due to capacity shortfalls in Germany. Short-term imports were merely market-driven,\" he said. Nuclear power is deeply unpopular in Germany, with polls showing around 80% of Germans backing Angela Merkel's decision this year to phase out nuclear faster than planned. A new poll published on Friday suggests that globally, just 22% of people agree that \"nuclear power is relatively safe and an important source of electricity\". However, the Globescan poll of 23,231 people in 23 countries showed that support in the UK actually rose from 33% to 37% since 2005. That chimes with a British Science Association-commissioned poll published in September showing UK support for nuclear power has remained steady since Fukushima. It found 41% of respondents agreed that the benefits of nuclear power outweighed the risks, up to 38% in 2010 from 32% in 2005. Flasbarth also rebutted suggestions that Germany's nuclear phase-out could increase its greenhouse gas emissions, which it plans to cut 40% by 2020. Stephan Kohler, head of the German Energy Agency, has criticised the phase-out, saying that it contradicts the government's carbon-cutting efforts as more coal will be burned. Although eight of Germany's 17 nuclear reactors have been shut down immediately and the remaining nine are to be taken offline by 2022, Flasbarth said greenhouse gas emissions will fall due to the European-wide emissions trading system. If companies burn more coal they need more emissions certificates – limiting certificates elsewhere. \"There would only be a problem if energy suppliers lobby successfully against strict greenhouse gas limits after 2020, or for new subsidies for coal power plants,\" Flasbarth added. Other critics of the nuclear phase-out, including Juergen Grossmann, head of energy giant RWE, have said companies would turn their backs on the country as energy prices would rise. Grossmann said: \"The deindustralization won't come all at once. It will be a gradual process.\" Flasbarth said such fears were overblown. Consumers will pay little for the new energy strategy, Flasbarth said. \"We will have a slight increase during the next ten years in renewables while our energy infrastructure will be refurbished, but no expert has stated that prices rise more than 5%. The renewable track is economically the best one. The energy intensive industry is actually privileged, ie they pay lower energy taxes and get direct and indirect subsidies.\" To fill the power gap after the nuclear phase-out, the new energy plan also includes fostering growth of green energies, moreso than any other industrialised nation. Wind turbines, biomass plants and solar panels, power storage sites and new grids are all planned. Tennet, a private grid operator, warned in a letter to chancellor Merkel that they can not connect offshore wind turbines to the onshore grid as fast as hoped. \"The warning letter to Merkel came from a company with a shortage of capital. This is a very specific situation with regard to this company, but we do not have a structural problem. We have to make big efforts, but there are enough companies ready for the task,\" Flasbarth said. The German Energy Agency has calculated that 3,600km of high-voltage transmission lines will be needed by 2020. Public initiatives against \"monster masts\" have already been founded and have received broad media coverage. But the German public's opposition to some renewable energy developments is dwarfed by the opposition to nuclear. Thousands of demonstrators took the streets in cities across the country after Fukushima, and badges saying \"Atomkraft nein danke\" became popular. Flasbarth says this anger goes back to 1970 \"when nuclear power was very much connected to nuclear weapons and East and Western Germany had the highest density of nuclear weapons\". He added: \"Those who argue that there will be a lack of public support for renewables are driven by wishful thinking.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/german-elections-blog-2013/2013/sep/20/peer-steinbruck-angela-merkel-negligence-nsa","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-20T07:32:41Z","webTitle":"Peer Steinbrück accuses Angela Merkel of negligence over NSA revelations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/german-elections-blog-2013/2013/sep/20/peer-steinbruck-angela-merkel-negligence-nsa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/german-elections-blog-2013/2013/sep/20/peer-steinbruck-angela-merkel-negligence-nsa","fields":{"headline":"Peer Steinbrück accuses Angela Merkel of negligence over NSA revelations","bodyText":"The NSA affair became a German election issue on Thursday when Social Democrat candidate Peer Steinbrück accused Angela Merkel of \"negligent\" treatment of the issue. He said the revelations of US internet surveillance represented a \"far-reaching interference with our basic democratic rights and personal self-determination\", and that Merkel had failed to \"protect German citizens' freedoms and interests\". His announcement followed a one-hour meeting with a group of writers and intellectuals who had signed an open letter to Merkel expressing their concern with her inaction over the NSA revelations. The letter, originally published in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in July, had since gathered 67,407 signatures. On Wednesday, the group of writers, which includes novelist Juli Zeh (Dark Matter, The Method) and short story writer Ingo Schulze (Simple Stories), had organised a protest outside the chancellory, but were snubbed by the German leader. Asked why he had decided to get involved in the protest, the writer and essayist Ralf Bönt said that \"writers and essayists have an acute sense of the distinction between the private and the public word, which the government seems to pretend doesn't exist. I would have liked to walk into Angela Merkel's office and got her to sign a document saying I've got nothing to hide.\" Novelist Priya Basil, a British citizen based in Berlin, expressed her regret that a similar debate hadn't sprung up among writers in the UK. She said: \"Britain as a society has to invite writers to speak up, and be ready to listen and respond to what they say even if it's tough and disturbing.\" In Germany, the protest by the self-billed \"writers' delegation\" was a throwback to the 1950s and 60s, when writers such as Günter Grass, Heinrich Böll and Hans-Magnus Enzensberger frequently spoke out on political issues such as engagement with the country's National Socialist past, nuclear power or the 1968 student protests.

We're told that no-one wants a wind turbine in their back yard. It's common knowledge that going green is only for the economic good times. And everyone knows that the only thing people are interested in when it comes to the energy system is the cost of their bills. The trouble with truisms, though, is that they aren't always as true as they first appear. And as a new report on a major programme of work exploring public attitudes towards the UK energy system shows, many widely shared assumptions about what motivates public views on energy are probably in need of revision. The report – produced by my colleagues in the Understanding Risk group at Cardiff University for the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) – is one of the first to document public perceptions of the energy system as a whole (rather than as individual technologies such as nuclear or solar power). Based on a series of interviews, in-depth discussion groups and a nationally representative survey, the project documented how people think the energy system should change between now and 2050 – the date by which British emissions of carbon dioxide must be reduced to 80% of their current level. Ready for change First and foremost, people expect and even want change. Taking a pragmatic position in the face of inevitable transformation over the next 30 years, most people see an opportunity to \"do it right\". And for the majority of people, doing it right means a reduction in fossil fuels – seen as archaic, polluting and finite – and an increase in renewables. There were mixed views on whether wind turbines spoiled landscapes, or were actually good for local communities. But when considered in the context of other technologies, such as nuclear power, the message was clear: 21% opposed the building of a wind farm in their area, while 54% opposed the building of a nuclear power plant. Cost was found to be a critical determinant of public perceptions, with energy bills understandably featuring prominently. But, strikingly, the cheapest options were not necessarily the most preferred, particularly if they came with other undesirable attributes (eg fossil fuel reliance). In fact, through a closer inspection of the underlying principles on which public views were based, the report was able to describe a set of core values on which perceptions of the energy system seem to crucially hinge. These values included fairness, security, affordability, minimising damage to the natural environment and avoiding wastefulness. Particular technologies or social practices that embodied these values were likely to be viewed more favourably. Fairness, for example, was found to underpin beliefs about the openness and accountability of energy suppliers, the involvement of local communities in decisions about siting new technologies, and the potential for importing fossil fuels to cause global conflict. Only by taking a more holistic approach to the study of public views about the energy system were commonalities like these possible to identify. And, as the increasingly heated debates around fracking demonstrate, these are lessons that urgently need learning. Government must listen Despite acute concern over the development of fracking operations in Balcombe, West Sussex, and broader debates about the implications for climate change and energy policy, government and industry rhetoric has failed to engage with public values. In fact, local authorities have apparently been advised by central government to ignore fracking protests. This strategy, however, is likely to run into trouble. As the Cardiff report says: \"If actors do not consider and take into account public values in their decision-making, resistance to energy-system transformations or conflict over particular issues is more likely to result.\" In other words, governments and energy companies ignore the views and values of the public at their peril: a contract for social change will not be achieved by marginalising or otherwise excluding public views from the debate. And nothing less than a contract for social change is likely to deliver transformation in the UK energy system between now and 2050. For sure, there are multiple pathways to sustainability. But none will come to fruition if they do not embody values such as fairness and frugality – the underlying drivers of public beliefs. Public views about the energy system are about much more than household bills and nimbys. The sooner the government and industry bodies engage seriously with the values the public cares about, the more successful – and politically popular – that transformation is likely to be.

The internet now powers the movies we watch, the music we hear, how we communicate and the way we do business. This has led to an explosion in the amount of data we collate and consume, and all of that data requires a large and rapidly increasing amount of electricity. Most people would be surprised to hear how much electricity is needed to power the web's infrastructure. If the internet were a country, it would now rank sixth in the world for its electricity demand. By some estimates, the internet now uses 2% of the world's electricity – as much as the aviation industry – and that figure is expected to increase rapidly as we move from three billion people online today to as many as six billion by the end of the decade. This sounds like the beginning of a sad and familiar story of the 20th century: when other industries such as automobiles or air conditioning grew at breakneck speed, they drove damaging environmental impacts at the same rapid pace, especially with regard to our climate. Instead of following that script and building our dependence on polluting sources of energy, the internet can be a positive force for the environment and a driver of sustainability, but only if the companies behind it decide to power it with renewable energy. And some are doing exactly that. Six tech companies so far, including heavyweights like Google, Apple, and Facebook, have committed to powering their Internet operations with 100% renewable energy. Other influential companies like Salesforce, Rackspace, and Box have joined that commitment. These are some of the most innovative, forward-looking technology companies in the world, and they're applying that innovation to the energy they use in addition to the products and tools that they build. Their commitments are manifesting as real change, not just words on paper. For instance: • In North Carolina, Google, Apple and Facebook convinced the largest utility in the country (and one of the dirtiest) – Duke Energy – to start offering more renewable energy options. • Google has signed two contracts with wind developers to power its data center in Finland with 100% renewable energy. • Apple built the largest privately-owned solar farm in the country to help power its data center in North Carolina, and has announced that its data center in Nevada will be powered with solar and geothermal energy. • Facebook's decision to build a data center in Iowa helped to drive the local energy provider to scrap plans to build a nuclear power plant, and instead build a $2bn(£1.23bn) wind farm, which has led to the biggest single order of wind turbines on record. Many of these tech companies are honest that, while their renewable energy commitments reflect a sense of corporate responsibility, they aren't motivated entirely by altruism. With renewable energy flourishing and getting cheaper every quarter, the most profitable technology firms in the world simply see it as good long-term financial investment to use wind and solar power instead of outdated polluting forms of energy such as coal and gas. Unfortunately these bright spots are outliers in a sector that is still waking up to its environmental responsibility. Amazon Web Services (AWS), while not a household name, is a division of Amazon and host to one of the biggest corners of the internet. AWS is still building its prolific infrastructure with no regard for whether it is powered by clean or dirty energy. The company has failed even to disclose any information about its energy use, bucking a trend of greater transparency from other tech companies. Amazon's failure to embrace clean energy implicates a broad swathe of the internet, as popular companies including Pinterest, Spotify and Netflix are AWS customers. We should be able to use the web's incredible tools and services with the knowledge that our online work (and fun) is helping the environment, not hurting it. That possibility is becoming more real thanks to corporate leadership from some technology companies, but it won't be fulfilled until Amazon and the rest of the IT sector join those pioneers in applying their best qualities – innovation, competition, and big, forward thinking – to their energy use as well.

In order to remain as dry land, all the water that arrives at the Levels – by rainfall or by river flow – in 24 hours must flow out to sea in the 12 hours a day when the tide is low enough. In this area well-maintained drainage channels are essential. This was understood by the medieval monks who created the Levels, by Brunel, whose first effort at an iron ship was the little steam dredger he built for Bridgwater docks, and by the people who live there now. Flooding any farmland kills that season's crops of grass or vegetables, and is likely to reduce yields in later crops, putting up food prices and risking hunger among poor people. This is due to market forces when food is traded as a commodity. The argument that suggests dredging was stopped to protect the river bank wildlife always was nonsense. The wildlife had survived on the river banks because the previous management produced suitable conditions for it. There were arguments about the scale and speed of mechanical dredging, but allowing the upper levels of water voles' burrows to flood is as stupid as flooding villages. Huw Jones Pwll-Trap, Carmarthenshire • George Monbiot seems to be the only public person who has read and understood the technical knowledge relating to flood events. Piecemeal panic solutions are not the answer. In the transitions from the River Authorities to the National Rivers Authority to the Environment Agency, which deskilled and outsourced much professional engineering competence, local experience and knowledge of how to respond to flood events was lost. The need for \"whole catchment management\" has long been researched and published by the UK research and consultancy centres CEH Wallingford and HR Wallingford, which are highly regarded international experts in this field. Rather than making panic pronouncements about dredging, it would be better to commit to investment in competent expert studies of the problem catchments and how to manage them to minimise flooding in the future. Michael Thorn Helston, Cornwall • Dredging the rivers in the Somerset Levels would be little more effective than digging a big hole to hold the floods. A simple scenario may help George Monbiot's case. Imagine a stream flowing across a garden that occasionally floods the lawn. If it is deepened, it will merely hold more water. The outward flow will still be the same and it will still flood. Extending this deepening to the entire length of the stream would also do no good, as it is the slope of a water course that determines the amount of water it shifts. Deepened rivers shift the same amount of water as before, they just flow more slowly. To protect the garden, the banks of the stream would have to be raised, promptly sending the water next door. John Linfoot Bournemouth • Surely it is now the time to start building the Severn Barrage, both to remove the threat of high tides (in the same way as the Thames Barrier) and to generate non-polluting power, to fill the looming power gap of about 25%, as old generating stations are closed down. It is estimated that the Severn Barrier could produce the same power as four nuclear power stations – yet be non-polluting and totally renewable. Dr Brian Parsons Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire • Looking down from the Mendip Hills, a vast lake currently covers parts of the northern stretches of the Somerset Levels (Report, 3 February). Given that this is the part of the Levels least affected by flooding, it really makes you think what Britain will look like 50 years from now. By then the rise in global average temperatures will be approaching 2 degrees (in contrast to the havoc already being caused by our present 0.8 degree rise). Those friends of the British countryside (including the National Trust) who oppose proposals for wind and solar farms such as the Atlantic Array (an opposition campaign spearheaded in North Devon by Ukip) would do well to consider what \"natural landscape\" it will be that they are preserving through their opposition to renewables. There is a strong strand of conservative environmentalism which is still in deep denial about the actuality of climate change, and some of this can currently be heard demanding river dredging and other \"finger in the dyke\" solutions in south Somerset.

Almost all sources of energy, including many renewable ones, require large amounts of water to produce and in India, the trade-off is stark. India wants to expand its grid to the third of rural population with no access to power, yet existing power production is often undermined by poor water management and drought. A year ago the state of Maharashtra had to shut down all six units of a 1130MW thermal power plant after water levels in the dam fell to critically low levels. Diego Rodriguez, senior economist in the World Bank's water unit, says India is not alone. In the US, several power plants have had to rein in production due to low water flows or water temperatures too high to cool plant. France periodically is forced to cut back nuclear power production, and hydropower production in Sri Lanka, China and Brazil have all been compromised by lower water levels caused by drought. And the situation is predicted to get worse as rapidly expanding economies and more extreme weather conditions squeeze the world's limited water resource. By 2035, the World Bank says, global energy consumption will increase by 35% while water use for energy will go up 85%. For the first time last year, the International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook included a section on water, and warned that water constraints \"can challenge the reliability of existing operations and the viability of proposed projects\". At the Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi last month the World Bank launched its Thirsty Energy initiative to try to help countries manage the \"water-energy nexus\". It is aimed squarely at the energy community, Rodriguez said, because the conventional approach of tackling it from the water perspective has not worked. \"We always go from the water perspective, but if you see the minister of energy sitting beside the minister of water resources, it is pretty clear who will win in any debate.\" Rodriguez says the World Bank is offering to send in a core team to help countries integrate their water and energy planning. In most countries there is little joined up thinking about energy and water availability at the planning stages. \"A country's [water resource] is divided by watersheds while energy is divided by national, regional and sub-regional grids.\" Future expansion plans for the energy sector rarely internalise the cost of building infrastructure such as canals and pumping stations to supply water. Nor do they take into account the environmental and social impacts of water use by power plants, he says. \"Even if you don't consume the water, if you abstract it and discharge it at a different temperature there will be a potential impact on the ecosystem.\" South Africa has been experimenting with dry-cooling technologies in power plants, but these use more energy to run, and are two to four times more expensive. And it is not only fossil fuel plants that need water for their cooling processes. Of the renewable sources, only wind power and photovoltaics use negligible amounts of water. Morocco last year awarded contracts to a Saudi consortium to build a 160MW concentrated solar power plant in the desert at Ouarzazate, with another 300MW planned. Rodriguez points out that CSP requires large amounts of water to keep the mirrors clean. \"We must understand the trade-offs. You can't look at the water and energy sectors in isolation anymore,\" Rodriguez says. \"You need to have constant feedback between the two.\" This week's conference in Delhi is only one of many this year that will highlight the issue. Global Water Intelligence, organisers of a global water summit in Paris in April, says water risk is the biggest challenge the global economy faces. It predicts that in the next 10 years everyone on the planet will \"experience a water related event – a shortage, a flood, an infrastructure failure, an interruption to business, an economic disruption – which will have a bigger impact on our lives than we have ever experienced before.\" Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

Europe, defence, nuclear, history, government spending. But the prime minister is human; mere flesh and blood. So for at least part of the time, David Cameron will have been saying one thing to President François Hollande while thinking another; this guy - this short bespectacled guy with the slicked back hair; with that time-worn look – merging Jack Nicholson and Sven Göran Eriksson. With his place at the centre of an infamous love triangle, and not for the first time either - how does he do it? And the answer is that in his way President Hollande is a bit of a smoothy. Happy to talk for hours in a fashion seemingly effortless. Confident in his own skin. Happy to milk the limelight on his own terms. And we all saw that during their press conference at RAF Brize Norton on Friday when the president - who came to talk about Europe and defence and history and government spending - was asked by the man from a British newspaper (the super, soaraway Telegraph) about the recent entanglements in his private life. \"Monsieur Le President,\" began senior political correspondent Chris Hope. \"I know this is a very sensitive subject for you. Do you think your private life has made France an international joke. Are you still having an affair with Julie Gayet. And do you wish she was here?\" Cameron's reaction was not to react. He launched into an answer to a question about his referendum, and it was clear that even he had no idea what was coming out of his mouth. He was playing for time on Hollande's behalf. Hollande himself mouthed something about Britain being entitled to have a referendum if it wanted one. As to his own wants and desires, he smiled an uneasy smile and said. \"With regard to your last question, I'm afraid I decline to answer.\" A question later, the prez and the prime minister stepped down from their respective podiums to continue discussions at an Oxfordshire pub. Hollande may have needed a drink, and he did shoot a final glare at the press before leaving the auditorium. But there was an impressive composure about the French president. So many admirers. They can't all be wrong. When they talked policy, it seemed that the two men agreed on the things that united them and agreed to disagree about the rest. Discussing nuclear power and the fact that EDF Energy will build the first new power station in a generation at Hinkley Point in Somerset, Hollande looked rather smug and Cameron rather grateful, particularly at the mention of thousands of jobs. They jointly expressed concern about the continuing tragedy in Syria, rattled sabres at the errant president supervising repression in Ukraine, and reminisced about military co-operation during French-led operations in Mali and the Central African republic. They also said they would work together to stop the number of young people being radicalised by terrorists and extremists; between 600 and 700 young people on either side of the Channel. That part was easy, indicated Hollande. \"We have the same interests and the same values.\" Both would collaborate over the 70th anniversary of D-Day and fuss over the Queen. Both countries would work together on satellite research in space. But it was clear there had been, and would be, little common ground over Cameron's demand for EU reform. Both said they wanted an efficient Europe: neither pretended they saw the nuts and bolts of that in the same way. They would never agree on everything said Cameron. \"François is a French socialist and I am a British Conservative.\" France wants the UK inside the EU, said Hollande. And he was not above a spot of mischief on that score, imagining perhaps - and despite the prime minster's known stance – a time of closer European integration. EDF will build at least two new nuclear reactors, he said. \"This is at least £16bn worth. I am talking of pounds here. Not for the time being of euros. I don't want to embarrass David.\" Which was kind, for the prime minister had probably sufficient embarrassment for one week, having faced a Commons rebellion from 80-odd of his backbenchers over the immigration bill. He was asked about the chaos at Westminster. Chaos? What chaos, he said? Everything went perfectly. Another thing for the two leaders to agree on. Life's trials only bother if you let them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/mar/26/nuclear-free-future-energy-strategy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-26T15:22:09Z","webTitle":"Nuclear-free future not an option for UK energy strategy, says chief adviser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/26/nuclear-free-future-energy-strategy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/mar/26/nuclear-free-future-energy-strategy","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear-free future not an option for UK energy strategy, says chief adviser","bodyText":"A nuclear energy-free future for the UK is not something the coalition \"is thinking seriously about\", the government's chief science adviser said on Tuesday at the launch of the country's long-term nuclear strategy. The government said its nuclear strategy would help seize the economic opportunities of a £1 trillion global market and provide 40,000 UK jobs. Prof Sir John Beddington, the government's chief scientific adviser, said new nuclear power was essential: \"We really can't see a future for the UK energy sector, if we are to meet our climate change obligations and have resilience in the power sector, without a significant component of nuclear. A non-nuclear scenario is not one the government is thinking seriously about.\" Beddington led a review of the nuclear research and development programme needed if the government's high-nuclear scenario for future energy is to be feasible. Prof David Mackay, chief scientific adviser at the department of energy and climate change, said this scenario – one of four set out in the 2011 carbon plan – envisaged 75GW of nuclear capacity in 2050 providing 86% of the UK's electricity, a situation he compared to France today. The industrial strategy, welcomed by the nuclear industry which worked with government to develop it, covers every part of the nuclear chain from new build, operations and maintenance and waste management. It includes: • £15m for new research facilities in the UK. • Collaboration with the $450m US government programme to build small, modular reactors than can be transported or stacked together. • £12.5M to join the Jules Horowitz Test Reactor programme being constructed in France to develop future advanced nuclear fuels. • Examining new technologies including thorium reactors, which cannot meltdown, and fast reactors, which can be fuelled by waste plutonium. • A focus on training the next generation of nuclear engineers, as 70% of current senior staff are due to retire in the next 10 years. The energy secretary, Ed Davey, said: \"Nuclear and other forms of low-carbon power mean highly skilled jobs and sustainable growth. We need all our energy options in play in the fight against climate change, and to keep the lights on in a way that is affordable to consumers.\" The business secretary, Vince Cable, added: \"We need to sharpen [the UK's] competitive advantages to become a top table nuclear nation.\" Craig Bennett, at Friends of the Earth, said: \"The nuclear industry has always over-promised and under-delivered and it is extremely risky for this government to bet the UK's energy future on new designs of nuclear reactors that we don't know the cost of and we don't know will ever be built. In contrast, there are huge opportunities for the government to throw its weight behind renewable and energy efficiency technologies that already exist and are proven to work.\" The government is in the middle of tense negotiations with EDF, the energy company controlled by the French state, over the guaranteed price it will receive for electricity from its two planned reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset. But Mackay said the government would be committed to future nuclear power even if the EDF deal fell through. Mackay alluded to the enormous projected cost of the EDF reactors, when describing the attraction of small modular reactors. \"One reason for interest in them is that they are easier to finance than the large reactors we have now, so they may be more attractive to the economy,\" he said. Beddington added: \"There is the potential of synergy by working with the US, which is setting up a large SMR programme. It creates the possibility for piggy-backing on the US work.\" Future decisions on the UK's energy mix \"will depend on political and financial issues\", said Beddington. \"Our job was to [recommend the R&amp;D measures needed] to ensure that if the choice was made in future to go for the higher nuclear level, we could do it.\" He said his panel had presented some advice to government in December: \"The broad response is that it has been accepted.\" Greenpeace's policy director, Doug Parr, said: \"In 2010, the Climate Change Committee identified the low-carbon technologies the UK should develop and deploy in order to become world leading. The list included offshore wind and marine energy. It did not include nuclear. With the cost of offshore wind predicted to be on par with or cheaper than nuclear by 2020, there is no rationale for distorting policy to prop up the nuclear dinosaur.\" Mackay said the approach to dealing with the UK's 100 tonne stockpile of plutonium was changing from a heavy focus on the mixed-oxide fuel (MOX) approach, a programme which has suffered huge and costly failure in the past, to include consideration of advanced \"fast\" reactors, which can consume plutonium. The International Energy Agency has estimated that there will be £930bn of investment in new nuclear reactors in the next 20 years, and £230bn in decommissioning and waste storage. In January, the government suffered a serious setback when councils in Cumbria rejected a proposal to host a deep geological disposal site. The prime minister, David Cameron, said previously that a permanent waste solution should be in place before new reactors were built."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/dec/03/fukushima-daiichi-tsunami-nuclear-cleanup-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-03T19:22:36Z","webTitle":"Fukushima two years on: a dirty job with no end in sight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/03/fukushima-daiichi-tsunami-nuclear-cleanup-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/dec/03/fukushima-daiichi-tsunami-nuclear-cleanup-japan","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima two years on: a dirty job with no end in sight","bodyText":"Carefully, gently, one-by-one. The removal of nuclear fuel rod assemblies from a badly damaged building at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant is finally under way. Months in the planning, the job is risky, complex, and crucial. Here begins the first major step in the toughest decommissioning project ever attempted. Fukushima is home to six nuclear reactors, three of which were running when the giant tsunami swept across the site on 11 March 2011. The defuelling operation centres on the building for reactor four. Though the reactor was shut down for maintenance when the towering wave struck, all its radioactive fuel, and more from earlier runs, was held in a storage pool on an upper floor of the building. Under normal conditions, the storage pool above the reactor was a safe haven. But four days into the crisis a hydrogen explosion tore through the structure and blew the walls and roof off. Moving the radioactive fuel from the wrecked building to a more secure site became a high priority. Some fuel assemblies have already been moved. Workers use a crane to reach down into the pool, lift an assembly from its rack, then lower it into a waiting cask that sits upright on the pool floor. When a cask is full – each can take 22 fuel assemblies – a second crane hoists it from the pool and places it on a trailer. Filled casks are then transported to a more secure storage facility on the site. The procedure sounds straightforward enough. But there are 1,533 fuel assemblies in the pool at building four. Each is 4m long, and holds up to 80 individual fuel rods. The team of 36 workers that are responsible for the job will work in six shifts around the clock. The job will take until the end of 2014. And that is with no glitches. But the work at reactor four is only the start. Once the fuel is removed to a safer place, workers will turn their attention to a further 1,573 fuel rod assemblies held in similar pools in the buildings for reactors one, two and three. All were running when the tsunami struck; all suffered meltdowns. The radiation in these buildings is still intense, and access inside is limited. Though delicate and painstaking, retrieving the fuel rod assemblies from the pools is not the toughest job the workers face. More challenging by far will be digging out the molten cores in the reactors themselves. Some of the fuel burned through its primary containment and is now mixed with cladding, steel and concrete. The mixture will have to be broken up, sealed in steel containers and moved to a nuclear waste storage site. That work will not start until some time after 2020. To fully decommission Fukushima Daiichi might take 40 years and no one expects a cakewalk. Independent researchers point to the litany of mishaps that has blighted the cleanup. They doubt the plant's operator Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) is up to the task, and want a global team of experts to take over. Even high-level advisers signed up by Tepco describe the decommissioning project as an \"unprecedented\" challenge. At stake is Tepco's reputation, the health and livelihoods of local communities, and the future direction of the industry worldwide. \"With the sheer number of things that are going wrong, they should be more openly bringing in help,\" says Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts, who has analysed seawater for radiation directly offshore from Fukushima. \"Tepco is a nuclear power producer, not a cleanup operation. There are people with expertise in decommissioning reactors, and they need to be brought in whether they are Japanese, European or American. Every time they have a problem, they come up with a solution that takes a long time to bring in, and then doesn't even solve the problem. \" Tepco does have international advisers. In the wake of criticisms over its handling of the crisis, the company set up an independent Nuclear Reform Monitoring Committee. The committee is led by Dale Klein, former chairman of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). His deputy is Lady Barbara Judge, former head of the UK Atomic Energy Authority. They do not underestimate the long job ahead: this is make or break time for Tepco. Who should the public trust? In nuclear issues it can be hard to know. The engineers with most experience, those best placed to make a dangerous site safe, are industry insiders. Nuclear is their livelihood. But who does not have biases? Are anti-nuclear activists better qualified, more honest? Are academics more independent? University staff who work on nuclear technology are often funded by, or have close links to the industry. Perceived biases can be just as harmful to trust as real ones. John Large, a UK-based nuclear consultant, says Tepco needs more outside help to decommission the plant. He wants the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to arrange for a team of engineers with hands-on experience to assess the site, and come up with a fresh plan of action. But he concedes there are problems with the idea. Industry engineers will defend the industry, he says. \"They need to be told: 'Forget the fact that you design these reactors, right now we need your expertise.'\" Tepco has planned heavily to reduce the danger of another high-profile mishap while it removes fuel from the storage pool at unit four. Engineers have beefed up the cranes that will move the fuel. If a fuel assembly jams in its rack, the crane should stop pulling immediately, to reduce the risk of breakage. A second crane that lifts the cask is designed to hold its load even if power is lost. All these will help. A dropped nuclear fuel assembly will not go critical, but more radiation might escape. That may not be dangerous beyond the site, but it could be the final straw for Tepco's reputation. \"We haven't had a problem of this magnitude before in decommissioning,\" says Lady Judge. \"When you're dealing with decommissioning a reactor where there's been an accident you have to respond to difficulties. When you're dealing with decommissioning a reactor that's reached the end of its productive life, you are being proactive and you can do it in a much more slow and methodical manner.\" Good news is hard to find around Fukushima. In the earliest days of the crisis, a plume of radioactive material blew northwest from the site and settled as a teardrop scar reaching more than 30km across the land. From the coastline, through the towns of Okuma, Futaba and Namie, are huge patches of ground where the additional annual dose of radiation is more than 50 millisieverts. Natural background radiation, from cosmic rays and sources in the air and rock, reaches 2 to 3 millisieverts per year. A preliminary IAEA report in October on efforts to clean up the contaminated land was full of praise for the remediation work so far, and made a handful of gentle suggestions for improvement. Yet the work is far behind schedule in seven of 11 selected towns and villages; the deadline of March 2014 is now unachievable. This month, officials in Japan admitted for the first time that thousands of evacuees from the worst affected areas may never return home. The governing Liberal Democratic party says a more realistic approach is needed: it wants compensation for the 160,000 people displaced by the radioactive leak, so they can rebuild their lives elsewhere. Up on the cliff overlooking the Fukushima plant is a bleak reminder of an ongoing battle at the site. This strip of land was once filled with trees, a place for workers to go walking. Tepco has cut the trees down now, to make room for 1,000 huge metal storage tanks. They hold more than 360,000 tonnes of radioactive water, enough to fill 140 Olympic swimming pools. The volume rises every day. Over the next three years, Tepco wants to add storage for another 270,000 tonnes of radioactive wastewater. Ultimately, the water must be returned to the Pacific. There is nowhere else for it to go. The steady accumulation of contaminated water is in part down to geology. The three reactors that were running when the tsunami struck are kept cool by flushing them with 400 tonnes of water each day. The process leaves the cooling water laced with radioactive contamination. But Fukushima sits at the bottom of a hill, on land with a high water table. Hundreds of tonnes of water drain down the hill every day, quietly beneath the surface. When this subterranean flow reaches the power plant, it enters the cracked reactor buildings and mixes with the contaminated cooling water. Much is pumped out and passed through a filter made with zeolite clay, which removes dangerous caesium isotopes. But the other radioactive substances remain. This water, around 300 tonnes a day, is pumped into the storage tanks up on the hill. Some scientists questioned from the start Tepco's decision to store contaminated water. Another earthquake could rupture the tanks and see another major radioactive release from the site, they feared. So far, Tepco has been spared that particular disaster, but the concerns are still justified. Smaller accidents have been rife. In August, workers discovered that 300 tonnes of radioactive water had leaked from one of the tanks. The radiation emanating from the puddle left on the ground was enough to give a bystander the industry's five-year maximum permissible dose in just one hour. In October, half a tonne of contaminated water spilled on to the ground and may have drained to the sea, when tanks overflowed with rainwater. \"It's clearly something they need to get a handle on,\" Allison Macfarlane, chair of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told the Guardian. \"Water is a big issue for them, but they've also got to keep the reactor cores cool, and they've got to clean it up.\" Tepco has taken on a US consultant, Lake Barrett, who led the NRC's cleanup of Three Mile Island, the worst commercial nuclear power accident in the nation's history. \"It's certainly confidence-shaking to hear about spills and inadvertent releases from the plant. Even though the radioactivity levels are quite small, the public certainly don't have trust and confidence in Tepco's ability to do the more important things like the defuelling, and that is a problem for them,\" he says. In a November report, Tepco said it had set up 15 specialised teams to replace old bolt-fastened tanks with welded ones, install water level gauges, and up the number of patrols that inspect the tanks for leaks. While two thirds of the storage tanks are welded steel vessels, more than 300 are makeshift, added in haste to increase capacity at the site. They are made from steel sheets that are bolted together and sealed with plastic packing. Water stored in the tanks is contaminated with a host of radioactive substances. One of the most troubling is strontium-90, which mimics calcium when it gets into the body. The substance concentrates in bones, so even low levels in the environment can build up over time and become harmful. When released into the ocean, strontium works its way into fish bones, which can make catches unfit for consumption. The hazard will last a long time: strontium's radioactivity takes 30 years to fall by half. Tepco is trying to decontaminate the water with an \"advanced liquid processing system\" (Alps). In principle, the technology can strip all radioactive substances from the water, except tritium, one of the less dangerous radioactive substances, which was spread widely through the environment by nuclear bomb tests in the 1950s and 1960s. Tepco claims the system will ultimately decontaminate more than 500 tonnes of water a day. But that may be optimistic. The equipment has suffered multiple failures. In the latest setback on Sunday, an ALPS unit was shut down when a pipe began to leak acid. Workers wrapped a vinyl bag around the joint to stem the flow while Tepco investigates. Even at a rate of 500 tonnes a day, cleaning the stored water will take many years. But Tepco must get Alps up and running. The company then needs to arrange disposal of the treated water, and the radioactive material filtered out by the system. The radioactive waste will go into containers and be sent for long-term storage. The tritium-laced water will be released into the Pacific, but Tepco has yet to get public support for the move. \"The problem hasn't gone away,\" says Macfarlane. \"The water is cleaner, but you still end up with tritium in there, so they're going to have some tough decisions about what to do.\" Fukushima is the first nuclear accident to release large amounts of radioactive material directly into the ocean. Radiation levels surged in seawater after the tsunami struck, with concentrations of caesium-137 recorded at 60 million becquerels per cubic metre near the plant. The nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima released 89 trillion becquerels of caesium-137. The levels in the waters off Fukushima fell sharply though, as the caesium dissolved and dispersed on the ocean's currents. Tepco estimates that around 300 tonnes of contaminated groundwater still flow into the Pacific each day. The levels of radioactivity are small compared with the releases in 2011. Buesseler has measured contamination in water, fish and other organisms from a ship off the coast of Fukushima since the accident unfurled. He is not worried about the immediate health risk, but says fish and other marine life will concentrate radioactive substances, making them unsuitable for consumption for years. \"We're not talking about levels that cause direct harm when I'm one kilometre offshore,\" says Buesseler. \"But through the uptake into the seafood and fisheries, you end up having to keep those closed, and that's a billion dollar industry and a cultural loss for Japan.\" Buesseler is critical of what he sees as false reassurances from the Japanese government. \"They have said some silly things, that it's largely under control. That doesn't really mean anything when you are out on a ship and you are seeing elevated levels of these isotopes. 'Under control' is not a good phrase for the situation right now,\" he says. Tepco's latest plan to stem the flow of radioactive groundwater into the ocean is to solidify the soil around the site to form an impermeable \"icewall\". This should divert groundwater around the site, and stop it mixing with contaminated cooling water. The project will not be cheap. The Japanese government has pledged £300m to help build the barrier, insisting that the danger of leaks and spills make the wall essential. Ice wall technology has been effective in the construction and mining industries, but has never been tried on the scale planned at Fukushima. Lake Barrett, the US consultant brought in by Tepco, is sceptical of the plan. \"I don't think it'll make that big a difference. It's several hundred million dollars, and some of that might be better spent on an integrated water plan,\" he says. Even if the ice wall works, it could cause fresh problems. Groundwater flowing out to the ocean keeps seawater from seeping inland at Fukushima. Block that flow, or divert it, and saltwater is sure to encroach. Normally, this would not be a problem. But the soil around Fukushima is laden with radioactive caesium. The substance binds to clay in freshwater conditions, but crucially is released again by saltwater. \"If you stop the fresh water flowing out, that would very likely cause the caesium in the ground to be released. You then have a pulse, of what is currently in some way safely buried, going back into the ocean,\" says Buesseler. \"It is certainly something they should think about.\" More mishaps are inevitable at Fukushima. The plant is wrecked and decommissioning will take decades of arduous, complex work. In Japan and in other countries, the crisis has already dented public confidence in nuclear power. That has harmed their economies, says Judge. \"Many countries, not just Japan, overreacted to Fukushima and they are suffering. In Germany they are buying gas from Russia, they're buying nuclear energy from France. The Poles are planning, right on the German border, a nuclear power plant to service the German market. They're burning coal, which is really amazing, because their emissions are also going up. So what was a political decision has turned out to be detrimental to the entire economy and particularly to the people,\" she says. The media have not helped. \"Two years ago there was a huge earthquake and tsunami that killed around 20,000 people. But every day when I read the paper, it said, 'nuclear disaster, nuclear disaster, nuclear disaster'. In actual fact, not one person has died of radiation, nor is anyone likely to. \"The straight story is the Japanese didn't have a nuclear response plan. There were a lot of human errors during what happened at Fukushima. It was old technology, badly maintained, and the regulator was not respected. Those are the facts. They have to be faced and dealt with.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/jan/10/india-asks-us-withdraw-diplomat-delhi-devyani-khobragade","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-10T18:31:23Z","webTitle":"US withdraws diplomat from Delhi over Devyani Khobragade row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/10/india-asks-us-withdraw-diplomat-delhi-devyani-khobragade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/10/india-asks-us-withdraw-diplomat-delhi-devyani-khobragade","fields":{"headline":"US withdraws diplomat from Delhi over Devyani Khobragade row","bodyText":"The US state department has agreed to India's request to withdraw a diplomat from Delhi in connection with a row that has threatened to badly damage relations between the countries. It appears that the dispute – sparked by the arrest of India's deputy consul general in New York on charges of visa fraud and underpaying her maid last month – is moving towards a conclusion. Devyani Khobragade was expected to land in Delhi late on Friday on an Air India flight from New York after a battle of nerves over two days that resulted in her effective expulsion from the US hours after she was granted immunity from the charges against her. \"The drama is coming to a close. It was beginning to seriously affect the relationship and, because there is still sufficient goodwill despite the outrage, we have seen serious efforts in recent days to find a way out,\" said Raja Mohan, a foreign affairs analyst in Delhi. Khobragade's arrest caused outrage in India and prompted a range of retaliatory measures in Delhi against US diplomats. Though John Kerry, the US secretary of state, expressed regret after the incident, this fell short of the apology demanded by India. Senior US officials postponed trips to India while Indian officials expressed \"deep disappointment\". Hours after a grand jury in New York indicted Khobragade, 39, for visa fraud and making multiple false statements, and with a court appearance due next week, a series of last-minute moves saw the US first grant a visa confirming her full immunity, then ask India to waive that immunity and finally ask the mother-of-two to leave the country. Indian official sources said they had applied for the visa, normally a formality, about three weeks ago. Khobragade flew out of the US, according to her lawyer, with \"her head held high\". \"She looks forward to assuring that the truth is known,\" the lawyer said. The US state department confirmed a US official would leave Delhi, saying it deeply regretted the move. Senior officials in Delhi had earlier confirmed a demand for the US diplomat of Khobragade's rank to be withdrawn – tantamount to an expulsion – following a \"strict principle of reciprocity\".Officials in India have not directly denied US prosecutors' claims that Khobragade lied to visa officials about the salary she would pay her maid, who had been flown over from India, but say the charges are a \"grey area open to interpretation\". \"The worst that can be said about her is that she did not comply with the amount that was supposed to be paid under the law,\" Salman Khurshid, India's foreign minister, told the Guardian last month. The indictment claims Khobragade showed visa officials in India a contract which stated she would pay her Indian maid $4,500 per month but subsequently wrote out a second contract offering a significantly lower rate of pay and eventually gave her employee far less than the US minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. It is also claimed that Khobragade withheld her maid's passport and had forced her to work 13- to 15-hour days, seven days a week. She denies all wrongdoing. Though the exact sequence of events leading to the arrest is unclear, it appears the US state department alerted Indian authorities to the pending prosecution of Khobragade several weeks before the diplomat was arrested. Usual practice in such cases is for the official in question to be quietly withdrawn. However, no action was taken as the legal case against Khobragade gathered momentum. Indian authorities had shifted Khobragade to their mission at the UN after her arrest, a move that should have guaranteed full diplomatic immunity rather than the limited immunity that comes with a consular post. However, without a crucial visa from US authorities the possibility remained that Khobragade could still have been open to prosecution. If found guilty she would have faced up 10 years in jail. One sticking point in the deal, according to Indian officials, was Khobragade's own demand that she be allowed to return to the US in the future. It does not appear that this demand has been met. Her husband is a US citizen and her two children were still in the US last night, officials told the Guardian. While New Delhi and Washington stressed the importance of their bilateral relationship during the crisis, it took weeks of complex wrangling to find a workable solution both sides could live with. Earlier this week Indian authorities ordered the US embassy to close a club for expatriate Americans there. Security barriers outside the embassy were removed in the days after the arrest of Khobragade in \"a spirit of strict reciprocity\", said one Indian official with direct knowledge of the case. A trip to India next week by the US energy secretary, Ernest Moniz, was postponed around the same time. The US assistant secretary of state for south Asia, Nisha Desai Biswal, delayed her first visit to the country to avoid the trip becoming embroiled in the dispute. Khobragade's departure removes the focus of current friction between New Delhi and Washington but it is unclear how long it will take for the anger to subside in the run-up to national elections in India in May. Outrage in India has been fuelled by politicians' unwillingness to seem out of step with public mood. On Friday opposition leaders accused the ailing administration of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, of failing to protect Indian interests. \"Bringing Khobragade is our defeat, not a win, because a case will be on against her in the US. The US has decided,\" Yashwant Sinha, of the Bharatiya Janata Party, told reporters. The treatment of Khobragade – who was briefly detained with other criminal defendants and strip-searched – caused particular anger. Relations between the US and India have long been rocky, though steadily improving since a nadir in the 1970s. Barack Obama received a warm welcome on his visit in 2010 when he described the two countries' shared interests as the foundations of \"a defining partnership for the 21st century\". However there remains deep suspicion of Washington in Delhi, and in India more generally, and many US officials see India as a difficult partner. Critics accuse Obama of failing to pay sufficient attention to ties with a country viewed as a key strategic counterbalance to China and an engine to boost the US economy, while American hopes of building a more robust business relationship with India have run into bureaucratic hurdles. Frustration has grown among the US corporate lobby. Indian sourcing rules for retail, information technology, medicine and clean energy products are contentious and US firms complain about \"unfair\" imports from India of everything from shrimp to steel pipes. In June more than 170 US lawmakers signed a letter to Obama about Indian policies they said threatened American jobs. Earlier this week the Indian prime minister cited a 2008 deal with the US on civil nuclear power as one of the major achievements of his nine-year tenure. However, implementation of the deal was blocked when Indian lawmakers passed crucial legislation affecting the liability of overseas firms investing in nuclear power in the south Asian country. Khobragade's arrest touched a range of sensitivities in India. Almost all middle-class households in India employ at least one, and often several, members of staff who will undertake tasks from cleaning and cooking to childcare and driving. With few Indian diplomats paid enough to legally employ local staff to perform such functions in postings in the west, the practice has long been to fly out Indian workers and paid rates that, if low in the US and elsewhere, would be generous at home. Preet Bharara, the prosecutor in Khobragade's case, said last month: \"In fact the Indian government itself has been aware of this legal issue and that its diplomats and consular officers were at risk of violating the law. The question then may be asked: is it for US prosecutors to look the other way, ignore the law and the civil rights of victims … or is it the responsibility of the diplomats and consular officers and their government to make sure the law is observed?\" There have been several previous incidents involving senior Indian diplomats in the US and domestic staff brought from India. In 2011 the Indian consul general, Prabhu Dayal, was accused by his maid of forced labour and sexual harassment, charges he called \"complete nonsense\" and that were later dropped. A year earlier a US judge recommended that an Indian diplomat and her husband pay a maid nearly $1.5m in compensation for being forced to work without pay and suffering \"barbaric treatment\" in their luxury Manhattan apartment. Bharara, the prosecutor, made the highly unusual move of issuing a lengthy statement addressing the arrest. He said Khobragade was afforded courtesies most Americans would not get, such as being allowed to make phone calls for two hours to arrange childcare and sort out personal matters, after she was arrested by state department agents outside the school that her children attend in Manhattan. Bharara, who was born in India but moved with his family to New Jersey, defended his case. \"One wonders whether any government would not take action regarding false documents being submitted to it in order to bring immigrants into the country,\" he said. \"And one wonders why there is so much outrage about the alleged treatment of the Indian national accused of perpetrating these acts, but precious little outrage about the alleged treatment of the Indian victim and her spouse?\" Khobragade will now take up a post in Delhi, a statement from the Indian ministry of external affairs said. \"At the time of her departure for India, Counsellor Khobragade reiterated her innocence on charges filed against her. She affirmed her gratitude to the government of India, in particular to the external affairs minister, and the people of India, as also the media, for their strong and sustained support during this period,\" it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2017/may/30/general-election-2017-may-corbyn-paxman-snp-manifesto-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-30T20:05:58Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn interviewed on The One Show – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/may/30/general-election-2017-may-corbyn-paxman-snp-manifesto-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2017/may/30/general-election-2017-may-corbyn-paxman-snp-manifesto-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn interviewed on The One Show – as it happened","bodyText":"We are wrapping up today’s edition of Politics Live - here’s a brief summary of Tuesday’s highlights on the campaign trail: Theresa May sought to relaunch her general election campaign with her strongest personal attack on Jeremy Corbyn, claiming the Labour leader’s performance in Monday night’s live television debate showed he would be “naked in the negotiating chamber” when Brexit talks start next month. Jeremy Corbyn appeared to forget the cost of a key Labour childcare pledge during a tense interview on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour. He later apologised for not knowing the figure and defended presenter Emma Barnett’s right to ask him questions, saying it was “unacceptable” that she received antisemitic abuse on Twitter following the interview. A second Scottish independence referendum should be held after the Brexit process is complete, Nicola Sturgeon has said, signalling a significant change in her party’s constitutional strategy. The Conservative party is trying to use Monday’s TV leaders’ interviews as a chance to reboot its faltering election campaign with an online push focusing on Brexit and immigration. Jeremy Corbyn ended the day with an interview on BBC1’s The One Show that focused on personality rather than policy, but was not joined by his wife in contrast with a similar appearance by Theresa May and her husband Philip earlier this month. Scott D’Arcy of the Press Association has compiled this handy list of five things we learnt from Jeremy Corbyn’s interview on The One Show. The Corbyn household’s chores are not split between “boy jobs and girl jobs”. Asked if he and his wife Laura Alvarez divided housework along gender lines, in a similar way to Theresa May and her husband Philip, Corbyn simply shook his head. The hedge outside his house used to be concrete. “That’s an entrance to a garage and that was a lump of concrete. It was the devil’s own job to break up that concrete and turn it into a garden.” He was a tearaway toddler. After being shown a picture of himself as a toddler harnessed into his pram, Corbyn said: “I was a bit, sort of, free-spirited and I kept climbing out of the pram and running off.” His parents were not pushy. Naomi and David Corbyn may have met at a demonstration in support of the Spanish republican government, which at the time was under threat from Franco’s fascists, but he said their “strong views” were never imposed on him. “They never pushed the views down our throats at all. They were very much liberal thinkers - they believed people should think for themselves and discover themselves and a path for themselves.” He was an academic failure. Asked about having left Adams’ grammar school with two E grades at A-level, Corbyn said: “I was not an academically successful student. My mum was an ever-generous lady and I said, ‘well these are pretty poor, these results’, and she sort of looked at me and said, ‘they probably couldn’t read your writing’.” He said he may have written “overlong answers to one question because I was quite interested in the subject and forgot the rest of it”. A touch of non-Corbyn news for a moment. John Bercow could face opposition if he seeks to remain Commons Speaker after rowing back on his pledge to step down next year. Bercow, who originally said he would serve nine years in the Speaker’s chair, said the snap election had persuaded him to change his mind. But Tory MP James Duddridge, a prominent critic of the Speaker, called Bercow a “self-serving parasite” who should not be returned to the role. Bercow is standing for re-election in Buckingham and told Sky News that if returned to the Speaker’s chair by MPs after 8 June, he would like to continue for the full term of the parliament. His critics on the Tory benches were angered earlier this year by the revelation that he voted remain in the EU referendum and by his handling of the row over President Donald Trump’s state visit. Some had held off the idea of opposing his return to the role because of the expectation he would stand down. But Bercow, who was elected Speaker in 2009, said: “I had originally indicated an intention to serve for approximately nine years. If I may legitimately say so, I made that commitment eight years ago, it was before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, it was before the EU referendum. “I’m looking to the people of Buckingham to re-elect me as their member of parliament and then I will, if I am successful in that quest, ask the House whether it is willing to allow me to continue as Speaker for the 2017 parliament, which can run up to five years.” Daily Mirror political editor Jack Blanchard gives his take on Corbyn’s One Show appearance: Here’s a clip of Jeremy Corbyn’s One Show interview: And that’s it from Jeremy Corbyn on The One Show. The twitterati seem to be saying that Corbyn comes across as far warmer and nicer than Theresa May did. The Mirror’s Kevin Maguire: Jim Pickard of the Financial Times adds: We are also treated to a picture of Corbyn’s allotment. What does he like about it? The open space, the chance to grow things, and unwind, he answers. There is “something magic” about growing your own peas, potatoes and the like, he says, before presenting Alex and Ore with a pot of homemade jam. Now we’re on to Corbyn’s love of manhole covers. Behind a picture of a Thomas Crapper cover is an image of the Labour leader with an Arsenal scarf. He sometimes referees under-10s matches and is asked whether they, or the parliamentary Labour party, are easier to control. No prizes for guessing his answer is the former. Corbyn says his parents were liberal thinkers who brought up their children to think for themselves. “I try to carry on in that tradition.” Despite going to grammar school, he only got two Es at A level. Realising he wasn’t going to get into university with those grades, he applied to VSO and went for a “weird interview” in which he was asked how he felt about chickens being slaughtered. Corbyn responded that he was a vegetarian but that if others wanted to eat meat that was fine by him. Initially thinking he would be going to Malawi, he was sent to Jamaica instead. Corbyn says his attitudes and principles haven’t really changed over the years. He enjoys meeting variety of people and learning from them: “You have to be prepared to listen to others.” We learn that he was a Sunday paper boy in rural Shropshire and that his grandfather was a solicitor who became known as the “poor man’s lawyer” after moving to Ealing in west London. Asked about media coverage of his family and personal affairs, Corbyn says that “intrusion in my life is not nice”, but adds “it goes with the territory”. In case we needed reminding, co-host Ore Oduba reminds viewers that the interview, which continues after the show’s first film, will be about personality rather than policy. Corbyn says he never set out in life to be prime minister but that he is “giving everything he can” to win this election. We are then treated to a picture of Jeremy as an infant in a harness, shackled to a pram. Jeremy Corbyn is on The One Show and Alex Jones kicks off by asking if there are boys and girls’ jobs in the Corbyn household. The Labour leader shakes his head, but does say he demolished a concrete wall outside his north London home to replace it with a green hedge. Jeremy Corbyn will appear on The One Show without his wife, Laura Alvarez, after choosing not to follow the example of Theresa and Philip May’s joint interview with the BBC1 programme. Labour rejected the offer of a similar format because Corbyn maintains that his family is completely out of bounds during the general election campaign. Alvarez, a Mexican human rights lawyer who runs a fairtrade coffee company, became Corbyn’s third wife in 2013 after they met some years before at a Latin American group. The 48-year-old has rarely spoken to the press but told Vice News in a documentary of her pride in Corbyn’s response to David Cameron being rude about his dress sense. Alvarez said: “Jeremy stood very strong. It was amazing.” The Labour leader very rarely speaks about his family life, acknowledging last month in the speech he was “averse to talking about myself”. Philip May also has a relatively low profile but revealed a few personal details in the One Show interview, including that his wife had wanted to be prime minister for at least seven years. Speaking about their division of the domestic labour, the prime minister also said there were “boy jobs and girl jobs”, with her husband taking the bins out when he was asked to do so. He said he made the tea “from time to time”. Ken Loach, the award-winning director of films including I, Daniel Blake and Cathy Come Home, has made another Labour election broadcast. While the first featured Jeremy Corbyn, this time it is shadow chancellor John McDonnell’s turn to shine. Loach said his new film was about the insecure, low-paid work that was “blighting the lives” of millions of Britons. “This is a film about insecure, low-paid work, which is blighting the lives of millions of working class people. This has soared under the Conservatives, especially in the large parts of Britain which they have neglected and left behind, without jobs or investment. Labour’s programme will restore security to people’s lives, enabling everyone, regardless of their background, and all communities across our country, to thrive.” In the broadcast being aired on BBC One at 6.55pm, McDonnell said Labour will not accept “foodbank Britain”, adding: “Everybody, whatever their contract, will have equal rights at work - sick pay, holiday pay and a real living wage. We will end zero hours contracts. No-one will be forced into bogus self-employment.” If you want more Jeremy Corbyn, though, stay tuned after the broadcast for his interview on The One Show with Alex Jones and Ore Oduba. Chances are he may have an easier ride than the grilling he got on Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour this morning. Jeremy Corbyn is yet to decide if he will take part in tomorrow’s BBC TV debate with other political leaders, at which the home secretary, Amber Rudd, will stand in for Theresa May. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, is believed to have been lined up to represent Labour in the BBC election debate in Cambridge, but it is understood no final decision has been made and the official decision will be announced on Wednesday morning. The Labour leader has previously said he would not attend unless he was debating the prime minister. Rudd will attend the BBC debate along with the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, Ukip’s Paul Nuttall, the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru’s Leanne Wood. The SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, has confirmed she will not attend and her party will be represented by her deputy, Angus Robertson. More here. Gary Gibbon has written an interesting post on Theresa May’s Brexit speech on his Channel 4 News blog. Here’s an extract. To add to their queasiness, Theresa May conjured the image of Jeremy Corbyn going naked into the negotiating chamber. If you hadn’t got the image, she repeated it later in her address. She used the word “weak” to describe him three times in one sentence. That is the adjective that comes back particularly strongly in focus groups, rather then “leftwing” or “extreme”. One Tory candidate from the region said he hadn’t seen anything of the wobble that the polls were talking about. He said: “I wouldn’t want to be anything other than a Tory in the West Midlands right now. She works better than Cameron here – the background, something about that I think. She’s a bit like Thatcher was in the West Midlands.” That’s all from me for today. My colleague Chris Johnston is taking over now. Jeremy Corbyn has condemned people who have made abusive comments about the BBC journalist Emma Barnett after she tripped him up in an interview by asking about the cost of his childcare plans. (See 11.15am.) Some of it has involved people calling her a Zionist. Corbyn said: It is totally and absolutely, completely unacceptable for anyone to throw abuse at anyone else. Journalists do ask difficult questions and journalists do do a job that does require asking difficult questions sometimes in difficult circumstances. If you don’t like what a reporter says or asks me, or anybody else, understand the question they’re asking. We will all do our best to answer those questions, but under no circumstances whatsoever should anyone throw personal abuse at anyone else, because they are doing the job that they have been employed to do and I will not tolerate it under any circumstances. He also claimed he did not mind people asking him difficult questions. There isn’t such a thing as being unfair to politicians. If you put yourself up for elected office in public life you are subject to permanent scrutiny. I never get upset by these things. Never be so high and mighty that you can’t listen to everybody else and make sure that you understand the motives of the majority of our people and the kind of society that we want to live in. Josh Pope, who is standing for the Greens in the Plymouth Moor View seat, is notable for two reasons, firstly his age – he’s only 19. But he’s also possibly the only election candidate who is urging their supporters to back somebody else. As with many Greens, the local party had been in talks with Labour over the idea of the so-called progressive alliance – the Greens standing down so as to increase the chances of a Labour win, in return for some reciprocal policy commitments. This didn’t work out and the party stood Pope. Now, however, he’s posted a message on his official website saying people should back the Labour candidate, Sue Dann, anyway. The seat is currently held by the Conservatives’ Johnny Mercer with a majority of 1,206, precisely three votes more than the Greens took in 2015. While the Greens were very different from Labour, Pope wrote, “I have to be pragmatic and realise what is best for the country”. He continued: The Green party is leading by example, taking steps to help ensure that there is a strong opposition after the election, one that will hold the government to account on important issues. I would love to do that myself, but I recognise that in this election it is the Labour candidate, Sue Dann, who has the best chance of beating the Conservatives and helping to create a more balanced parliament. Here is the ICM write-up of today’s poll. And here are the tables (pdf). Theresa May’s jibe that Jeremy Corbyn would be “alone and naked in the negotiating chamber” (see 12.54pm) if he was responsible for the UK’s Brexit talks was a deliberate echo of one of the bitterest and best remembered phrases in the Labour party’s internal history. At the 1957 Labour party conference in Brighton, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, Aneurin Bevan, who as health minister in the 1945 Labour government presided over the creation of the National Health Service, made a speech on the nuclear weapons issue containing the phrase that would haunt the Labour party for a generation. More than 120 resolutions on nuclear weapons had been submitted to the conference. One, from Sunderland, demanded that a future Labour government “shall not under any circumstances produce or use any form of nuclear weapons”. Another, from Huddersfield proposed that “Britain should give a lead to the world by unilaterally renouncing the manufacture and use of the hydrogen bomb”. The resolutions put Bevan, traditionally the darling of the constituency parties and the unchallenged leader of the postwar Labour left, in a quandary. In the weeks running up to the conference, Bevan gave a number of speeches which flirted with the idea of supporting the anti-nuclear cause in some way. But when he rose to speak he had already decided on a different course. Making the argument that a unilateralist Britain would have no diplomatic leverage, Bevan retorted in his mellifluous Welsh voice that: “You will send a foreign secretary, whoever he may be, naked into the conference chamber.” A few minutes later, in a second devastating comment that made Bevan’s ally Michael Foot wince as if in pain, Bevan said of unilateralism: “You call it statesmanship. I call it an emotional spasm.” It was, said the leftwing writer Mervyn Jones “the speech that put an end to Bevanism,” a movement on the left of the Labour party that had been dedicated to making Bevan party leader. After Brighton, Bevanism collapsed. Bevan himself was to die of stomach cancer at the age of 62, in 1960, the year in which Labour briefly adopted a policy of unilateral disarmament. But that devastating speech of 1957 has never been forgotten, not least by May’s speechwriters this week. Matthew Goodwin, the academic and Ukip specialist, has been looking at our Guardian/ICM polling numbers. He says they show Ukip voters from 2015 seem to have stopped drifting to the Tories: As promised, here are more results from today’s Guardian/ICM poll. One way to assess who is winning a campaign is to look at the headline state of the parties’ numbers. But another way is to ask directly about the campaigns being run by parties and their leaders. We did this four weeks ago, and again this weekend, and the results are striking. Four weeks ago Theresa May was the only leader judged overall to be running a good campaign, and the Conservatives were the only party that people said they were more likely to vote for based on what they had seen of the campaign. Now that has reversed, and Labour and Jeremy Corbyn are seen as winning the campaign. Labour has been doing best at gaining voters in the campaign, the ICM poll suggests. Four week ago the Tories were the only party that seemed to be picking up new voters, but now it’s Labour. Corbyn is the only party leader who is overall seen to be running a good campaign, the poll suggests. Four weeks ago it was May, but she has thrown away her lead on this measure. Here are the figures: We asked people, on the basis of what they have seen of the campaign in the six weeks since the election was called, whether their chances of voting for each main party had increased or decreased. Conservatives Increased: 14% Decreased: 24% Stayed the same: 52% Don’t know: 10% Net: -10 (down 13 points from the +3 net when ICM asked the same question four weeks ago, when the election campaign had been running for just two weeks) Labour Increased: 25% Decreased: 18% Stayed the same: 47% Don’t know: 10% Net: +7 (up 13) Lib Dems Increased: 9% Decreased: 19% Stayed the same: 60% Don’t know: 12% Net: -10 (down 3) Ukip Increased: 6% Decreased: 22% Stayed the same: 61% Don’t know: 12% Net: -16 (down 4) Greens Increased: 6% Decreased: 15% Stayed the same: 67% Don’t know: 13% Net: -9 (down 2) We then asked about the party leaders, and whether they were running a good campaign or a bad campaign. Theresa May Running a good campaign: 34% Running a bad campaign: 37% Don’t know: 29% Net: -3 (down 22 points from the net +19 when ICM asked the same question four weeks ago, when the election campaign had been running for just two weeks) Jeremy Corbyn Running a good campaign: 36% Running a bad campaign: 34% Don’t know: 30% Net: +2 (up 21) Tim Farron Running a good campaign: 18% Running a bad campaign: 31% Don’t know: 51% Net: -13 (down 2) Paul Nuttall Running a good campaign: 8% Running a bad campaign: 37% Don’t know: 54% Net: -29 (down 6) Caroline Lucas Running a good campaign: 12% Running a bad campaign: 18% Don’t know: 70% Net: -6 Jonathan Bartlett Running a good campaign: 5% Running a bad campaign: 16% Don’t know: 80% Net: -11 We also asked two questions about the Manchester attack. Thinking about how Theresa May has responded to the Manchester attack, do you think she has handled it: Well: 53% Badly: 17% Don’t know: 30% And if Jeremy Corbyn were prime minister, how do you think he would have handled it: Better than May: 17% Worse than May: 32% Much the same as May: 32% Don’t know: 18% A majority of people think May handled the Manchester attacks well, the poll suggests. A third of people think Corbyn would have handled them worse, the poll suggests. The rest either think he would have handled them better or much the same, or don’t know. (That is a useful lead for May, but perhaps not as big for May as she might have hoped given that security and home affairs is supposed to be her strong point.) ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative sample of 2,002 adults aged 18+ online on 26 to 29 May 2017. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. UPDATE: Here is the ICM write-up of the poll. And here are the tables (pdf). The Institute of Fiscal Studies has put out an analysis of the SNP’s plans for tax and spending and of Scotland’s fiscal position. The SNP has no chance of forming a government at Westminster, but it has set out the the kind of spending plans it thinks a government at Westminster should adopt. This is what the IFS says about those plans: Like Labour, the SNP would like a target of balancing the current budget (the difference between tax receipts and day-to-day spending) by 2021–22, stating they would support borrowing only for investment purposes from that year onwards. Overall the SNP say their plans would allow £120bn of extra spending between 2017–18 and 2021–22. This increase in spending – and borrowing – would be consistent with falls in national debt as a share of GDP, but at a slower pace than under current plans. The additional day-to-day spending on public services the SNP plans would allow is less than that set out in Labour’s manifesto. On welfare though, the SNP plan to go further than Labour in reversing planned benefit cuts – ending the cash-terms freeze to working-age benefits and revoking restrictions on tax credits and universal credit to the first two children in a family, for instance. Their plans imply a net increase in taxes relative to current plans – including an increase in the top rate of income tax, an increase in the bank levy, a bankers’ bonus tax and the cancellation of further cuts to corporation tax – although there would be tax cuts targeted at SMEs. However, unlike Labour whose plans mean increases in day-to-day spending will be largely funded from (much larger) tax increases, the SNP’s plans imply most of the increase in spending would be funded by additional borrowing. The 2.3% of GDP target for overall borrowing set out by the SNP is consistent with investment spending increasing in line with the plans set out in March 2017 and implies lower investment than under Labour’s plans (an additional £250bn over 10 years). Jeremy Corbyn was in Watford to launch Labour’s race and faith manifesto. Speaking at the launch, he said: Labour is the party of equality. We were built on the values of social justice, internationalism and human rights. Our values are rooted in the fundamental truth that whatever your background, wherever you are from, you should have the means and opportunity to fulfil your potential. People continue to be treated unfairly due to their ethnicity or faith. The recent rise in hate crimes, including antisemitic and Islamophobic attacks, underscores how far we still have to go. Labour will repair the damage done by the Conservative government, which has sown the seeds of division in our communities. Only Labour can be trusted to unlock the talent of black, Asian and minority ethnic people, who have been held back by the Conservatives. We will guarantee equality is at the heart of our programme for government. Labour will implement a comprehensive strategy for racial equality, one that effectively challenges the disadvantage many black, Asian and minority ethnic communities suffer. We will work every day for a fairer society, where every person is enabled to get on in life, regardless of race, faith or ethnicity, to build a Britain that works for the many, not the few. Speaking at a Labour campaign event in Watford, Jeremy Corbyn apologised for not being able to give the cost of his childcare policy in his Woman’s Hour interview earlier. He said: I didn’t have the exact figure in front of me, so I was unable to answer that question, for which obviously I apologise. But I don’t apologise for what’s in the manifesto and I will explain exactly what the cost is. It’s £4.8bn it will cost by the end of the parliament and it means that 1 million children will get childcare, free childcare: 30 hours per week between the years of two and four. The SDLP, the smaller nationalist party in Northern Ireland, wants a poll on a united Ireland after Brexit. A demand for a “border poll” was the centre piece of the SDLP’s manifesto launch today. Colum Eastwood, the SDLP leader, said Brexit had created a route for Irish nationalists “for actually winning a border poll”. Eastwood denied that only nationalists would vote for a united Ireland, claiming non-nationalist pro-Europeans would also opt to stay in the EU by joining the Irish republic. All successive opinion polls in recent years however have shown a large majority within Northern Ireland in favour of remaining within the UK. The region did vote to remain inside the EU at last year’s referendum, with 56% voting to stay. Sinn Féin is also in favour of a border poll and this may be perceived as the SDLP’s move to defend its greener nationalist flank in response to the surge in support for Gerry Adams in last March’s elections to the Northern Ireland assembly. However, key figures in the peace process, most notably former Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern, have said any border poll would be dangerous and divisive, and could stir up sectarian divisions inside Northern Ireland. Here is today’s Guardian daily election podcast. It features Owen Jones, Jonathan Freedland and Sonia Sodha talking about last night’s “debate” and whether or not the election is a Brexit election. The latest Guardian/ICM poll is out. And it suggests that the size of the Conservative lead continues to drop, although not to the extent that other polls are saying. Here are the figures. Conservatives: 45% (down 2 from Guardian/ICM last week) Labour: 33% (no change) Lib Dems: 8% (down 1) Ukip: 5% (up 1) Greens: 3% (up 1) Conservative lead: 12 points (down 2) And here is a commentary from Martin Boon, ICM’s director, which helps to explain why ICM are giving the Tories higher leads than other polling organisations. Nerves are now certainly jangling in Conservative Central Office, with a YouGov poll last weekend showing a drop to only a 5-point lead, before easing to a 7-point lead yesterday. Survation, with a phone poll this morning split the difference with a 6-pointer for GMTV. This, from an ICM 22-point Conservative lead just three weeks’ ago. We too see a continuing Tory tumble with our latest Guardian poll showing a more comfortable, but still rapidly dwindled 12-point Conservative lead. The Tories have dropped two points since our last Guardian poll a week ago, and one point compared to our Sun on Sunday poll published yesterday. Labour remain stable or are up one, depending on your comparison preference. This poll was completed before last night’s leaders’ grilling on Sky/Channel 4. The dramatic shifts in polling numbers have been argued in many places to be a function of a sudden surge in young voters and/or 2015 non-voters, motivated by Jeremy Corbyn’s populist platform including the abolition of student tuition fees and return to state funded grants. The Survation poll this morning revealed that 82% of 18-24s would/already have voted, which compares favourably with the next two older age cohorts and is only a tick below that of the uniformly voting 55+ cohorts. Either this a full re-writing of the psephological textbook or needs to be viewed with extreme caution. Our own poll, suggests that about half that number (44% saying 10/10 certainty) of 18-24s will actually vote (even when full unweighted, it was only 50%). Clearly, this difference does bring to a head the new methodological battleground. Some pollsters, especially ICM, believe that the turnout scale no longer has value in disentangling voters from non-voters, because the fieldwork process (phone and telephone) predominately fails to reach the latter who are less interested in politics and by corollary, less interested in answering survey research. ICM stopped phone polling after the EU referendum, partly because we found it incredibly difficult to reach certain demographic groups – especially 18-24s. We, along with other pollsters typically reached half or less of the 18-24 target (by phone). We note with interest that Survation did a brilliant job in reaching them though – a full 80% of the target number (up-weighting them takes care of the missing residual). Whether Survation achieved this through full random digit dialling or whether they utilised some targeted sample would be interesting to know, but either way, the great irony about being good at their job is that this success could easily introduce the very skew that kills the poll’s accuracy. If the 18-24s reached are in some way different to the 18-24s not reached, i.e in saying they will disproportionately vote and vote Labour at that - when their wider counterparts will not and do not - it’s likely that the same failings of 2015 will be very much embedded in this sample. So how pollsters address the turnout issue is now central to what the poll says. We at ICM turnout weight using a matrix that assumes younger people will be less likely to vote than older, and less affluent people will be less likely to vote than the wealthy. This has been the general pattern of general election’s for an age, and whether you believe our poll findings or those of others will depend on whether or not you think Jeremy Corbyn can actually buck that trend. The poll also included questions about Manchester and about how the parties have fared in the campaign. I will post those results soon. ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative sample of 2,002 adults aged 18+ online on 26 to 29 May 2017. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. UPDATE: Here is the ICM write-up of the poll. And here are the tables (pdf). Theresa May delivered a substantial speech today, not just the standard stump one with a topical line thrown in. As I reported earlier, it included an audacious claim about wanting to “shift the balance of Britain in favour of ordinary working people”, which is not matched by May’s record so far on actual policy. (See 10.07am.) But it also contained a sustained and highly personal attack on Corbyn. Here are the key elements of it. May claimed that Corbyn demonstrated in last night’s Sky/Channel 4 election programme that he is not fit to lead the UK. She said: He is not prepared to use the nuclear deterrent. He is not prepared to take action against terrorists. He is not prepared to give the police the powers they need to keep us safe. He is not prepared to take a single difficult decision for the good of our economy. He is not prepared to answer questions about his long track record of supporting people who want to harm and even attack our country. She claimed Corbyn was particularly ill-prepared to lead the Brexit talks. And with Brexit negotiations due to begin only 11 days after polling day, he is not prepared for those negotiations. But I am prepared – prepared to take the difficult decisions that leadership demands. Prepared to do what is necessary to protect and defend our country. Prepared to go into the negotiating chamber with the EU just 11 days after polling day. I am prepared. I am ready to go. Jeremy Corbyn is not. Last night confirmed that. Only one of us has the determination to deliver the will of the people and make Brexit happen. And only one of us has the plan to make Brexit a success. She claimed that Corbyn would be “alone and naked” in the Brexit negotiating chamber. Last night showed that Jeremy Corbyn’s minders can put him in a smart blue suit for an interview with Jeremy Paxman but, with his position on Brexit, he will find himself alone and naked in the negotiating chamber of the European Union. Now, I know that’s an image that doesn’t bear thinking about, but actually this is very serious. She said that having Corbyn in charge of Brexit talks would lead to the UK paying more and having less independence. She said: [Corbyn’s decision to rule out leaving the EU with no deal] means being willing to accept any deal, however bad, signing up to any bill, however vast, accepting any terms, however unreasonable. It means signing up to Britain being governed by EU laws and EU courts for years to come, so that we have no control over our laws, to free movement continuing indefinitely, so we have no control over our borders, and paying what Europe wants us to pay, so we have no control over our money either. As always with Jeremy Corbyn and Labour, the shambles and the responsibility would be theirs but the consequences and the bill would be ours. The speech was opportunist because, in many respects, the Labour and Conservative Brexit negotiating aims are remarkably similar. Labour has set out six priorities for Brexit. All six overlap with what May wants. It was also hypocritical of May to attack Corbyn for being “alone” in the Brexit negotiating chamber. It is May and her government who have alienated EU partners; Corbyn does have allies in the party of European Socialists. But there is one big, key difference; May says she is willing to walk away from the EU with no deal, because “no deal is better than a bad deal”, while Corbyn is not willing to say that. He and Labour adopt the view that no deal would be a bad deal. May is pushing hard on this point because the opinion polls suggest the people agree that no deal would be better than a bad deal. She may also have been influenced by focus group research showing that people are uncomfortable about the idea of Corbyn representing the UK at Brexit talks. This has cropped up in published focus group research, and so presumably it is coming up in the Tories’ private focus groups too. For example, this is from a focus group convened by Lord Ashcroft, the former Tory deputy chairman who is now a polling specialist, in three Labour-held seats in the north of England. Those with doubts – particularly those previous Labour supporters who had voted leave last year – kept coming back to one point: ‘I would have voted Labour as per usual but I’m not sure that gentleman is the right one to go into the negotiations on coming out.’ For some distressed remainers, it hardly mattered who was speaking for Britain (‘We’ll get what we’re given. We’re outnumbered, we’re in a parlous position. We’ll rue the day, whoever is leading the so-called negotiations’), but for many others, which team would represent the country was the single biggest point at stake: ‘That’s the main thing for me that may swing me from Labour to Conservative’; ‘Brexit plays a part because there’s been nothing mentioned that I’ve seen about if Labour do get in, what are their plans? At least Theresa May is putting a plan into place.’ Caroline Lucas and a small gaggle of Green party activists have spent the morning carrying a large, cutout question mark around central London. Why, you might well ask? To highlight what her party argues is the lack of debate about the environment in the election campaign. The group stopped off at the Labour HQ and then Downing Sreet, before a photo opportunity with the slightly homemade-looking question mark and a brief speech by the Greens’ co-leader in Parliament Square. Afterwards Lucas told me the reasons for the stunt: The complete absence of this issue from the election campaign has been shocking. It remains the greatest threat that we face – we had the hottest year on record last year, and the 2016 State of Nature report which said our country was one of the most nature-depleted in the whole world. It’s meaningful to people when it then translates into things like air pollution. In a place like London, where kids can’t play in playgrounds because their parents are too afraid about what that’s going to do to their lungs and their health, this is a public health emergency. And even that hasn’t captured the imaginations of the other parties. Even as a supposedly radical party, Labour had a “blind spot” over continued support for fossil fuel subsidies and nuclear power, Lucas said: Until they loosen their grip on those old policies from a previous century, then they’re not going to be able to do the work that’s necessary and urgent when it comes to protecting our environment. George Osborne is getting the hang of this editing lark. His latest editorial in the Evening Standard is a corker. Here’s an excerpt. At home we face profound choices about everything from who we let into the country to how we sustain support for the free market and the free trade it depends on. Yet hardly any of this has featured in what was supposed to be the Brexit election. Labour knows the public shudders at the thought of Jeremy Corbyn representing the country abroad, so what passes for its campaign strategy has been a focus on softer domestic issues, from childcare to haircuts. The Conservative campaign has meandered from an abortive attempt to launch a personality cult around Mrs May to the self-inflicted wound of the most disastrous manifesto in recent history and, after the atrocity in Manchester, shrill attacks on Mr Corbyn’s appeasement of terrorism. Their campaign seems to have gone out of its way to avoid the very issue – Brexit – that was supposed to be the very reason we were having an election in the first place. The result can be summed up by what we imagine to be the conversation around the breakfast table in Downing Street: “Honey, I shrunk the poll lead.” The Standard editorial, which we can safely assume was approved by Osborne in his new capacity as editor, even if he did not actually write it himself, goes on to address the questions the Tory campaign should answer. It’s not too late to get back to the issues that count. Let’s be told how immigration is going to be reduced – not the blank responses this paper got from Cabinet ministers today. Let’s hear how we are going to try to keep tariff-free access to our largest export markets. Let’s debate how we are going to change the global view that thinks Britain is turning its back on the world. We have had no answers from Labour or the Conservatives. In other words, treat the public like grown ups, and allow them a chance to give the mandate the government claims to seek. Just in case anyone has missed it, Osborne has tweeted a link. Prime ministers give interviews to newspapers and often editors chose to conduct those interviews themselves, alongside their political editors. An Osborne/May interview would be a gripping read. But, sadly, there’s probably more chance of May doing a sit-down with the Morning Star. Q: Aren’t you telling voters they can have incompatible things on Brexit: frictionless trade, but withdrawal from the single market too? May says Labour would be happy to give control straight back to Brussels. A vote for her will be a vote for strong and stable leadership, she says. And that’s it. I will post a summary soon. Q: How much time have you been able to spend on the Brexit planning? And wasn’t it irresponsible to call an election so close to such important talks? May says she called the election because it was important to to get a mandate for Brexit. Q: Aren’t your increasingly personal attacks on Jeremy Corbyn a sign of desperation? And aren’t you demeaning the office of PM? May says her message has been the same through the campaign. There are only two people who could be PM: her or Corbyn. People have a choice. This is a choice between her “strong and stable leadership” and a “coalition of chaos”. Q: You said you want partnerships with the EU. Angela Merkel says she can no longer rely on the UK. What is your reaction? And what is your reaction to Labour’s Angela Rayner calling you an “ogre” in Brexit talks? (See 8.06am.) May says she wants a strong and deep partnership with the EU. She was working with Merkel at the Nato and G7 meetings last week. May ignores the Rayner question. Q: Isn’t it the truth that you are resorting to scaring people about Brexit negotiations to get their vote? May says she is setting out the position. The prime minister elected on 8 June will have to be ready to go into negotiations. She has the plan, the will and the determination to do that, she says. The prime minister has to be prepared. Nobody else is. Q: Last night you said no Brexit deal was better than a bad deal. But experts say whole sectors of the economy could be affected. Airplanes might not be able to fly to the EU. There could be a recession. What could be more catastrophic than that? May says other parties are willing to give anything away. Corbyn wants to do the worst deal for Britain at the highest possible price, she says. Q: [From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg] Don’t elections test leaders? Don’t people expect more from you than attacks on Jeremy Corbyn and the same speech you gave when you became prime minister? May says she has strong and stable leadership. She is being open about the tough choices ahead. She repeats the line “strong and stable” several times. Q: You have had a difficult election over social care. The polls suggest women voters are turning away from you. Are you a female prime minister with a women problem? May laughs this off (not entirely convincingly, it seems to me). She says the Tory plans on social care will take away risk. People will be able to keep their homes, and there will be a cap on what they pay. It is a policy that is fair, she says. May says Jeremy Corbyn has a “chaotic” approach to Brexit. She says that he called for article 50 to be triggered straight away. That would have been a mistake, because it would have meant the government not having time to prepare its negotiating strategy. And she claims that Labour has adopted seven different policies on Brexit. Here is Theresa May on why Brexit is so important. Our place in the world, our economic security, the vital public services upon which we all rely, our future prosperity – everything depends on, and will be defined by, the outcome of these next five years. If we don’t get them right, everything else we want to do in this country will be that much harder to achieve. If we don’t make a success of the next five years, our economic prosperity will suffer, jobs and livelihoods will be put at risk, and with them the security and peace of mind of working families. If we don’t make a success of Brexit, we won’t have the financial means to fund the public services upon which we all rely. Our National Health Service – the institution which is there for us at the most difficult times – needs us to make a success of Brexit to ensure we can afford to provide it with the resources it needs for the future. Every school in every village, town and city needs us to make a success of Brexit. If we want to continue to provide a sustainable welfare system, with help targeted at those who need it most – we need to make a success of Brexit. If we want to go on investing in transport infrastructure – our roads and bridges and railways – we need to make a success of Brexit. If we want to continue to play our part on the world stage, standing up for our liberal values, with strong defences to protect us – we need to make a success of Brexit. Everything depends on getting Brexit right. Here is the Theresa May quote about Jeremy Corbyn going “naked” into the Brexit negotiating chamber. Last night showed that Jeremy Corbyn’s minders can put him in a smart blue suit for an interview with Jeremy Paxman but, with his position on Brexit, he will find himself alone and naked in the negotiating chamber of the European Union. Now, I know that’s an image that doesn’t bear thinking about, but actually this is very serious. May is now talking about how the EU referendum vote reflected the fact that many people think life is not fair. These extracts were released in advance. See 10.07am. That is why, since the first day I stepped through the door of No 10 as prime minister, I have been clear that the mission of the government I lead is not just to get the best possible deal for Britain in Europe, but to take this opportunity to shift the balance of Britain in favour of ordinary working people. To fight for all those for whom life is more difficult than many seem to think or realise. Those who are just about managing to get by. People who are working around the clock and giving of their best, but for whom life is still too often a struggle. They do not ask for much. They just want to get on with their lives and to be able to do their best for their children. Above all, they just want to be given a fair chance. Because for too long – for too many people – life has not seemed fair. May says she only has to lose six seats for Jeremy Corbyn to become prime minister. (As Channel 4 News’ FactCheck pointed out recently, this claim is not credible.) Theresa May is speaking in Wolverhampton now. She says last night she saw that Jeremy Corbyn was not prepared to govern. He is not prepared to take difficult decisions. But she is. I am prepared. I’m ready to go. Jeremy Corbyn is not. She says Corbyn’s minders can put him in a suit. But he would go naked into the negotiating chamber, she says (channelling Nye Bevan.) That is not an image that bears thinking about, she goes on. “May v Corbyn Live: The Battle for Number 10” got a combined audience of 3.28m last night. It was averaging 2.9m on Channel 4, and 415k on Sky. In 2015 the equivalent Channel 4/Sky programme, featuring David Cameron and Ed Miliband, attracted a combined audience of 2.9m in a slightly later slot (9pm to 10.30pm, not 8.30pm to 10pm.) The programme did better last night than the BBC1, BBC2 and Channel 5 competition, my colleague Mark Sweney points out. The verdict of German commentators on Theresa May’s performance in the TV duel, which was livestreamed on many media sites last night and watched closely by political observers, might be summed up as rather damning. Interestingly, they pay far less attention to Corbyn in their analysis this morning. The Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) noted that May avoided answering several important questions, most notably over Brexit. “Asked if she thought Brexit a good idea (having voted against it) she dodged the question,” the paper said. “Theresa May is a worse election campaigner than expected,” it went on, adding that she was on the wrong foot from the start, having called an election after saying she wouldn’t. May, who was always presented as someone who was straight down the line and reliable, broke a promise because it suited her to do so in that moment. To watch May as an election campaigner, it continued, “is to see a speech robot who always comes out with the same slogans”. Seeing the Tories’ sinking poll ratings, the SZ concluded: Probably it was a mistake to have focused the campaign so much on May, a woman who the British are only now getting to know better … May promised a strong and stable government, but now the Tories appear nervous, even aggressive, resorting to personal attacks against Corbyn. Die Welt said May was “unashamedly laughed at by the public in the TV duel”. It continued: She was laughed at, she didn’t have her facial expressions under control, she swallowed too often, and shrugged her shoulders apparently for no reason. A few times she opened her mouth and no sound came out. She gave the impression of being distracted and nervous. Deutschland Funk, the main news radio station, said May was “visibly under pressure,” suggesting that she had deliberately avoided a direct duel with Corbyn because she knew she wouldn’t perform well. “Theresa May was evasive, particularly on why, in her six years as home secretary, she had not succeeded in restricting immigration,” the broadcaster noted, and over the Brexiters’ promise of £350m per week that would go towards the NHS. Confronted on these issues by Jeremy Paxman, it added, she looked “far from strong and stable, as is her her motto”. A second Scottish independence referendum should be held after the Brexit process is complete, Nicola Sturgeon has said, signalling a significant change in her party’s constitutional strategy. The first minister launched the Scottish National party’s general election manifesto in Perth, a key Conservative target, on Tuesday and sidelined her quest for a second independence vote in favour of an attack on Tory austerity. But in a key passage of the SNP manifesto, she appeared to drop her demands made in March for a second independence referendum to be held between autumn 2018 and spring 2019. She said then that she wanted the vote to be held after the terms of Brexit were clear but, if possible, before a final deal was signed. The document launched on Tuesday states: “At the end of the Brexit process, when the final terms of the deal are known, it is right that Scotland should have a choice about our future.” That implies the vote may not take place until later in 2019 or afterwards. Sturgeon had already signalled she would allow her previously rigid timetable to slip to late 2019, but Theresa May has said it could take several years after the UK signs article 50 in 2019 for the Brexit process to be complete. The manifesto repeats Sturgeon’s position that her government, having won the 2016 Holyrood elections, has a mandate to stage the referendum, but the failure to specify any date signals a softening stance. Sturgeon has finished taking questions. Q: Jeremy Corbyn said yesterday he would open discussions with you on a second referendum? And have you been too quick to write him off? Polls suggest he is winning the debate. Sturgeon says she watched some of the Sky “debate” last night. It would not be hard to come off better than Theresa May, she says. She says it is “outrageous” that the Tories are not answering questions about how their policies will impact on pensioners. Anyone watching that debate will have seen why May has dodged a debate, she says. She says only the SNP can stand up to the Tories. Q: You were on the front of previous SNP manifestos. But your picture is not on the cover of this one. Does this mean you are becoming less popular? Activists boo. Sturgeon jokes that she may allow that. She says you are damned if you do and damned if you don’t. She says when her picture was on the cover, people claimed it was a personality cult. She says there is a reason she is not on the cover: the baby on the cover is cuter. You can read the SNP manifesto here (pdf). Q: Have you got detailed costings for your plans? Sturgeon says the SNP’s borrowing plans would free up £118bn over the lifetime of a parliament. And the SNP’s tax plans would raise an extra £10bn. The SNP’s spending plans would cost £80bn. So they would be affordable under the SNP’s plans, she says. Q: The Conservatives are running their campaign on the basis that people do not want another referendum. There is some evidence that it is working. Do you worry that calling a second referendum could cost some SNP MPs their seats? Sturgeon says Ruth Davidson goes around Scotland saying Sturgeon talks about nothing but independence. But Davidson talks about it so much that she, Sturgeon, does not get a chance. She says Davidson’s support for the “rape clause” shames her. Q: Do you support Labour’s plans for a higher income tax rate for people earning more than £80,000 and lowering the threshold for the 50p rate? Sturgeon says she has set out the SNP’s plans here: a 50p rate for those earning more than £150,000. Q: If you lose seats, does that weaken your case for a second referendum. SNP activists start to boo. Sturgeon silences them. The media are here to do a job, and it’s an important job, she says. She says her view is that the party that wins the most votes wins. Q: Do you see the end of the Brexit process [the moment when she wants Scotland to have a say] as spring 2019? Sturgeon says Scotland must have a choice. Even today, May is talking about the damage Brexit could do if it goes wrong. She says has has spoken about Scotland having a choice “at the end of the process”. She says that is between autumn 2018 and spring 2019. That is May’s timetable, she says. If that changes, Sturgeon says she will change her position. Nicola Sturgeon is now taking questions. Sturgeon starts by saying the media do an important job of holding politicians to account. Q: What evidence is there that even a vast SNP presence at Westminster can constrain the Tories? Sturgeon says people have seen the SNP, not Labour, and Angus Robertson at PMQs, not Jeremy Corbyn, and that has been challenging Labour. She says Theresa May is “not so much the iron lady as the queen of the U-turn”. Sturgeon says, if the SNP wins a majority of seats, that will reinforce its mandate for a second independence referendum. Our future must be decided by us, not for us. Last year’s Holyrood election delivered the democratic mandate for Scotland having such a choice, and the recent vote of the Scottish parliament underlined it. If the SNP wins a majority of Scottish seats in this election, that will further reinforce our mandate. And in these circumstances, any continued Tory attempts to block Scotland having a choice - when the time is right and the options are clear - would be democratically unsustainable. However, that will be a choice for the end of the Brexit process. Sturgeon turns to Brexit. She says the single market offers a huge opportunity to Scotland. The European single market, already the world’s biggest, represents a massive opportunity for these areas of Scottish strength: in the digital economy, the services sector, energy, retail, the green and knowledge economy; the single market is still a work in progress, with huge potential still to be unlocked. That means a huge, potential economic prize for Scotland. It means a world of opportunity for our young people. But Brexit will put all of this at risk, she says. That is why I believe so strongly that at the end of the Brexit process – not now, but when the terms of the deal are known – Scotland must have a choice about our future; a choice between following the UK down the Brexit path or becoming an independent country. There is just too much at stake for Brexit simply to be imposed on Scotland, no matter how damaging it turns out to be. Sturgeon says the SNP will not support further reductions in the headline rate of corporation tax. And it will back targeted reductions in national insurance, she says. Sturgeon says the SNP’s plans for Westminster would allow health spending to be increased by more than the SNP government in Edinburgh already plans. We already have a pledge to increase the NHS budget by £2bn by the end of this Scottish parliament. But our alternative plan for the public finances would allow a further increase in frontline health spending across the UK. SNP MPs will call on the new UK government to increase health spending per head of population in England to the current Scottish level, which is 7% higher. That would increase the health budget in England by £11bn more than inflation by 2022 and it would deliver consequential funding to support additional investment in Scotland’s NHS of up to £1bn over and above our current commitment. Sturgeon says the SNP will protect the winter fuel allowance in Scotland (a matter for the Scottish parliament) and oppose the removal of the triple lock (a matter for Westminster). Sturgeon says the SNP remains committed to free personal and nursing care. The utter chaos that engulfs Theresa May’s plans for a so-called dementia tax makes me prouder than ever that the Scottish parliament introduced free personal and nursing care for the elderly. Those assessed as needing personal and nursing care in Scotland receive £249 a week – just under £13,000 a year – towards the cost of their care. That significantly reduces the burden on the personal assets of someone who has to fund their own care. So let me make clear today that the SNP will always protect free personal and nursing care. Sturgeon confirms that the SNP would back the top rate of income tax going up to 50p in the pound across the UK. And she sets out a three-point plan to tackle poverty. First, the SNP will back increasing the national minimum wage to “slightly more than £10 an hour” by the end of the next parliament. Second, the SNP will take a different approach to public sector pay. The 1% pay cap was designed to protect jobs at a time of spending cuts imposed by Westminster. While the SNP government has taken action to soften its impact on the lowest paid – ensuring, for example, that many nurses in Scotland are paid more than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK – there is no doubt that it has been hard for public sector workers. And at a time of rising inflation, it is increasingly unsustainable. Of course, pay rises must be affordable, but they must also reflect the real life circumstances people face and enable us to attract and retain staff in our public services. So for next year and in future years, we will not assume a 1% cap. Instead, we will set a remit for discussions with trade unions, and for our evidence to pay review bodies, that is based on a proper consideration of the impact of inflation – with a view to reaching fair outcomes that strike the right balance between affordability and the cost of living. And, third, the SNP will oppose further planned benefit cuts, Sturgeon says. So let me be clear, SNP MPs will stand against all of the further planned cuts to social security, because they will punish the disabled and those who work hard to make ends meet. We will also support the reversal of the two-child cap on tax credits. And we will campaign tirelessly against the immoral “rape clause” that goes with it, a policy that shames every Tory candidate who supports it. We will demand reversal of the cut to employment and support allowance that is removing £30 per week in vital support from disabled people. And we will oppose the freeze on working age benefits, a policy that is set to reduce the incomes of the poorest in our society by 6%. The reason we stand against the Tory assault on social security – on the poor, the disabled and the vulnerable – is this: These cuts strike at the very heart of how we see ourselves as a nation and our shared ambition for the future. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and Scottish first minister, is speaking at the launch of the SNP manifesto. She says Labour is not strong enough to take on the Tories. With Labour in disarray the Tories saw a chance to tighten their grip on the whole of the UK for many years to come. But with their true colours being exposed in this campaign, we have a real chance to keep them in check. And let’s be clear: Labour isn’t strong enough to do that. Voting Labour simply risks letting in Tory MPs. She says Tory policies will drive 1 million more children into poverty by 2021. That is a result of austerity, she argues. She says the SNP would adopt a different economic approach. So on the public finances, we are setting out a different approach. Our plan has three key aims: - firstly, to balance the UK budget for day-to-day spending by the end of the parliament, and after that borrowing only to invest; - secondly, to return the deficit to its pre-crash, long-term average; - thirdly, to set debt on a downward path. These responsible fiscal targets will return the UK’s finances to a stable and sustainable position. And, crucially, they will also free up an additional £118bn of public investment over the next parliament to grow the economy, safeguard public services and protect household incomes. Here is an audioBoom of Jeremy Corbyn not being able to say how much Labour’s childcare policy would cost. Emma Barnett asked Jeremy Corbyn about the online abuse women have received from some of his supporters. (Corbyn said he strongly opposed abuse of this kind, and that it did not happen in his name.) Barnett now seems to be getting a taste of it herself. Here is the transcript of the key exchange in the Woman’s Hour interview. Being a charitable sort, and having been up late last night myself because of the Sky/Channel 4 News debate, I have some sympathy with Jeremy Corbyn for not being able to say how much his childcare policy would cost. Channelling LBC’s Nick Ferrari (who has turned costings questions into a trademark), Radio 4’s Emma Barnett completely skewered Corbyn on this point. She even added a telling detail about Corbyn looking for the answer on his iPad. Alex Nunns, who wrote a sympathetic and rather good book about Corbyn’s election as leader (apart from all the bits slagging off the Guardian), thinks it doesn’t matter too much if a leader does not have instant recall of numbers. Many readers may agree. But election campaigns are unforgiving, and the general verdict is that it was a bit of a disaster for the Labour leader. (If you are a Labour supporter and you think otherwise, you also have to ask yourself what you would think if Theresa May had gone on Woman’s Hour and been unable to put a cost on the policy her party was promoting that day.) This is what political journalists and commentators are saying. From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg From the Daily Mirror’s Jack Blanchard From the BBC’s Chris Mason From Nyta Mann, the former BBC and New Statesman journalist From the Sun’s Steve Hawkes From ITV’s Carl Dinnen From the former Observer journalist Martin Bright UPDATE: I was trying to make the point earlier that, if you are trying to make a judgment about the seriousness of a gaffe by a politician you support, it is important to ask what you would think if someone on the other side made the same error. But Jack Seale is right to say that the example I used to make this case was a bit daft. One of the important facts about the election is that May and her party are not providing any costings for their plans at all. Q: If you lose, will you resign? Corbyn says he is looking forward to winning. Q: But if you lose … Corbyn says he is looking forward to winning. Q: At the weekend Ian Lavery, your election coordinator, said the Corbyn project was only just beginning. (This was taken as meaning Corbyn would stay on regardless.) Corbyn says Lavery was talking in terms of policy. Q: Do you really want this? Corbyn says he does. And that’s it. The interview is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: Labour has never elected a woman as leader. What single policy would you pick as best for women? Corbyn says educational investment. Q: So you are linking women to children? Corbyn says he is talking about improving opportunities for girls. He says he believes in telling girls they can do anything. Q: Only 10 months ago 45 Labour women MPs wrote to you saying you had to do more about the abuse of women MPs online. Corbyn says he is doing all he can on this. Abuse of women like this is totally unacceptable. People did not do this in your name. Q: They did. They were your supporters. Corbyn says he told people this was totally wrong. Q: On Trident, who should voters believe? The Labour manifesto, which is in favour? Or you, who are against? Corbyn says the Labour party has committed to Trident. But they are agreed a nuclear war would be disastrous. Q; CND says you are still its vice-president. Corbyn says he resigned as vice-president when he became Labour leader. Q: Can people trust you on this? Corbyn says people will accept this manifesto comes from Labour. He is proud to accept Labour democracy. Q: How much would you be willing to give to the EU? £100bn? Corbyn says he wants to negotiate a trade agreement. Q: Do you have a cash outpoint? Corbyn says he will not give one. Q: Would you be willing to leave the Brexit talks with no deal? Corbyn says this is a strange way to start a negotiation. Q: But would you be willing to negotiate to get a deal? Corbyn says he will get a deal. Q: If you say you will accept a deal on any terms, you go in on the back foot. Corbyn says he does not accept that. He says he is not threatening to turn the UK into a low-cost tax haven. Q: You have said you would give pension credit to help some of the Waspi women (the women who lose out from the increase in the state pension age). And you say you will look at other ways of compensating them. Corbyn says the principle is that they will not lose out. He says Labour has not had time to develop more detailed policies. Q: You have not said how you would fund for your social care plan? Corbyn says Labour would put in £2bn straight away. It would then come to an agreement on the long-term funding of social care. The money would go in to deal with the crisis, he says. The current system is very patchy. Q: So it is not costed. Corbyn says £2bn would go in now. Q: But the rest of it is not costed. Corbyn says it needs £2bn now. Barnett say says she has the figure. She quotes £2.7bn. Corbyn says that sounds about right. Q: But you are asking us to trust us with your money. And you have questionable links with the IRA and Hamas. You have never run anything. Harry Fletcher, who used to work for you, said your office was chaotic. Corbyn says Fletcher was briefly a volunteer in the campaign. Q: I didn’t expect you not to know how much your manifesto would cost. Corbyn says we have underfunded public services. Labour would raise corporation tax in order to pay for better health and social care. Q: You may want to start about childcare. You are promoting your childcare plans today. But this is not just a women’s issue, is it? Corbyn agrees. He says at the moment there is a patchwork of provision. Labour wants a universal offer of 30 hours a week. Q: How much will it cost to provide unmeans-tested childcare for 1.3m children? Corbyn says it will cost a lot. Labour is making it universal so every child will get it. Q: How much will it cost? Corbyn says he will give Barnett the figure in a moment. Q: You are logging into your iPad. Isn’t this the issue? You don’t know how much it will cost. Can we come back to this, Corbyn asks. Q: This is troubling. It hardly inspires the voters. Corbyn says people understand that if we don’t invest in children, they will do less well in school. Corbyn unable to say how much Labour’s free childcare policy will cost in radio interview. Emma Barnett is interviewing Jeremy Corbyn on Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour. The BBC’s Norman Smith says Tory protesters have turned up outside the SNP manifesto launch. Last night the Conservative campaign headquarters released large chunks of the Brexit speech Theresa May is giving later today in advance. It got overshadowed by the “debate”, but it contains some interesting lines. Here are the key points. May will claim that she wants to “shift the balance of Britain in favour of ordinary working people”. Firming up an argument that she has been making since the EU referendum result last summer, she will say: Because since the very moment the British people took that momentous decision, it was clear to me that it was not just a vote to leave the European Union. It was also a vote to change the way the country works – and the people for whom it works – forever. It was a quiet revolution driven by all those who felt let down and left behind for too long. A revolution in which millions of our fellow citizens stood up and said they were not prepared to be ignored anymore. That is why since the first day I stepped through the door of No 10 as prime minister, I have been clear that the mission of the government I lead is not just to get the best possible deal for Britain in Europe, but to take this opportunity to shift the balance of Britain in favour of ordinary working people. This is quite an audacious claim. Jeremy Corbyn is often accused of wanting to take Britain back to the 1970s, but, if this is anything to go by, it is Theresa May who is seeking inspiration from the Labour party of Harold Wilson and Tony Benn. The final sentence quoted above contains an echo of Labour’s 1974 manifesto promise to deliver “a fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people and their families”, a commitment that resurfaced in the 1983 Labour manifesto (aka, the “longest suicide note”). The “if” in the paragraph above is important. May’s rhetoric is one thing, but whether she can see it through in policy terms is another, as the social care U-turn illustrated. May, under the influence of her working class, leftish adviser Nick Timothy, originally proposed a “floor” on costs. “Floors” protect the poor, because they guarantee people can always keep a certain amount of their assets. The policy was supposed to be progressive. But, after Tory supporters protested, May proposed a “cap” too. “Caps” protect the rich, because they ensure that no one will have to pay more than a certain amount. This attempt to shift policy in the direction of ordinary working people failed. She will argue that Brexit is the most important issue facing the UK because in every other area of policy - such as health, welfare and infrastructure - the government will only succeed if Brexit works. For example, on health she will say: Our National Health Service – the institution which is there for us at the most difficult times – needs us to make a success of Brexit to ensure we can afford to provide it with the resources it needs for the future. She will say she is “100% committed to the cause” of Brexit. (That is not quite the impression she gave when interviewed by Jeremy Paxman last night, although in other respects she is increasingly starting to sound like a Brexit true believer). She will accuse the EU of adopting an “aggressive” negotiating position in the Brexit talks. The European commission has shown the importance of the choice faced by the British public next week. They are adopting an aggressive negotiating position, which can only be met by strong leadership on behalf of Britain. She will suggest that immigration causes unemployment. Because for too long – for too many people – life has not seemed fair. If you can’t afford to get on to the property ladder, or your child is stuck in a bad school … If you are one of the ordinary working people who made huge sacrifices after the financial crash, but see no evidence that the people who are better off than you did the same … If you’re one of those people who lost their job, who stayed in work but on reduced hours, took a pay cut as household bills rocketed, or – and I know a lot of people don’t like to admit this – someone who finds themselves out of work or on lower wages because of low-skilled immigration … In the past May has argued (on the basis of fairly limited evidence) that immigration depresses wages. Saying it causes unemployment goes further. (Again, the evidence for this is limited.) Only 13% of British Jews plan to vote for Labour, according to a poll for the Jewish Chronicle. Here’s an extract from its story. Labour’s overall 13 per cent voting intention figure represents an increase of 4.5 per cent since the question was last asked, in May 2016, by Survation, the polling company which questions Jewish voters on behalf of the JC. Asked the same question then, just 8.5 per cent of British Jews said they would vote for the party if an election took place. That result however immediately followed months of suspensions of party members for alleged antisemitism, and with no prospect of an imminent election. Ahead of the 2015 general election, 18 per cent of the community pledged support for Labour under Ed Miliband’s leadership. Asked this week, 14 per cent of British Jews said they had gone ahead and voted for the party two years ago, with the Tories receiving 67 per cent of the community’s votes. Claire posted an excellent summary of last night’s “debate” earlier. (See 6.34am.) The Times’s Matt Chorley also has a good round-up in his morning Red Box email briefing. Here is his conclusion. Did we learn very much? Not really. Both exceeded low expectations, and both camps could declare their candidate the winner with a straight face. Labour’s line that the audience laughed with Corbyn but at May had the ring of truth to it. What is clear though is we have a prime minister who cannot deal with mounting questions on domestic policy and wants to move the conversation abroad, and a Labour leader who prefers home territory rather than trying to explain his foreign policy outlook from Damascus to Dublin via Buenos Aires. If the big issue of the day remains Brexit, that favours May, who will use a speech today to try to win over working-class Labour and Ukip voters who wanted to leave the EU. But even if there are boys’ jobs and girls’ jobs, at some point she will also need to deal with the rubbish at home. Plaid Cymru is today publishing a “positive post-Brexit plan” for Wales. It includes five main points. 1 - A foreign trade shield to protect Welsh jobs and wages. 2 - New financial levers to give Wales a competitive advantage. 3 - A “Buy Welsh” procurement initiative to support Welsh firms. 4 - A Welsh “New Deal” incorporating continued regional development funding and agriculture support for a decade after Brexit, and securing Wales’ fair share of UK investment on infrastructure, research and innovation. 5 - A Welsh migration service to ensure a migration system that works for Wales. Adam Price, Plaid’s finance spokesman, said: Plaid Cymru wanted Wales to stay in the European Union but we respect the result of the referendum. The debate has to now move on to the task of making it work for Wales and not just the City of London and the south-east of England. It is about creating the kind of Wales we want beyond Brexit. Whilst our preferred option would be to maintain our membership of the single market and the customs union, both the Labour party and the Conservatives have committed to leaving both. It is our responsibility therefore to outline a contingency plan - to show how we can mitigate the risks and capitalise on the opportunities of Brexit. It is time to move on and face the political realities of the situation. Good morning. I’m taking over from Claire. Jeremy Corbyn breezed through his interview with Jeremy Paxman last night, but today he’s got a session with Mumsnet, which can be almost as tricky for a politician. Mumsnet has sent out some examples of the questions that have been submitted in advance. Would you be where you are today if you hadn’t gone to private school yourself? What kind of food do you have on board your battle bus? Is it healthy stuff, or are you living on crisps and Haribo Tangfastics? I’ve heard you have no sense of humour. Can you tell us a joke? What did you think of Theresa May holding hands with Donald Trump? Why didn’t you show up for the leaders’ debate? I felt like you didn’t bother to argue for my vote. How will you fund your spending plans if many of the banks currently based in London relocate? If Labour loses seats overall in the election, will you step down straight away? Was the manifesto leaked accidentally-on-purpose? You can read the thread here. Andrew Sparrow is now picking up the live blog. Your daily reminder: if you’d like the Snap election briefing email sent to you every weekday, do sign up here. The Brexit secretary is up next and he’s dismissing the polls that show a narrowing of the Tory lead: I always go into election campaigns assuming nothing. He wants to go back to talking about Brexit, as per the Tory campaign reboot. He says the Labour attitude is “naive”, claiming Rayner believes that “if we’re nice to them” – remaining EU members – the UK will get a good deal. Davis claims Jean-Claude Juncker and others have had to “back off” and admit Theresa May “is a good negotiator”. She doesn’t want to do the negotiations on air and that’s quite reasonable. The simple truth is that you [the media] want to get as much of the information as possible … We have over 100 pages of detail, two white papers … a five-page-plus letter to the European Union, all laying out what we’re after. What we’re after is a tariff-free arrangement … If we can’t have one, we’ll have to design our strategy as appropriate. Davis signs off with the “no deal is better than a bad deal” line that is now seemingly a contractual obligation with every Conservative appearance. On Labour’s childcare plans, Rayner says that by allowing parents to work more hours, the rise in GDP means the pledge “will pay for itself”. She says it will also “transform the life chances” of young children who would benefit from early years education. Next up on Today are Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, and the Brexit secretary, David Davis. Rayner is leading Labour’s announcement on childcare today. She says voters want to focus on domestic issues, not the Tory repetitiveness of “Brexit means Brexit”. We don’t believe the general election was required for Brexit. Rather, Rayner says, the election would give May cover to carry out domestic policy changes. She says May’s tactics so far have made the UK look “like ogres” and “a laughing stock” in Europe: The negotiation is part of a dialogue between two parties and at the moment, unfortunately, Theresa May and the way that she’s handled it has made us look like ogres across Europe. If you see the pictures now, Theresa May is at the back of the queue whenever she’s talking to the leaders of Europe. We’re a laughing stock across Europe and we don’t need to be ... I believe it’s the way Theresa May has handled it so far. She says no deal is better than a bad deal. No deal is a bad deal, actually. Rayner says Labour’s “managed migration” would involve preventing employers from bringing in overseas workers to undercut local pay. We won’t put arbitrary numbers on it. In a speech later today, Theresa May will try to angle the campaign back towards the issue of Brexit, on which she and her strategists think she has the edge. For Westminster leaders, the issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic has been rather a side issue, but the question of what would happen in the event of a “hard Brexit” remains unresolved. Dan Mulhall, Ireland’s ambassador to London, has just been speaking to the Today programme. The Brexit negotiating guidelines make it clear that the member states want to avoid a hard border, he says. We are very strongly of the view that any hardening of that border would be a very negative thing … People have become accustomed to moving back and forth across the border … It’s also an important element of the wider political process that supports the peace process. “Special, creative and flexible arrangements” will be needed, he says, adding that for border and trade reasons: We would prefer it if Britain were to remain in the European Union. Mulhall confirms that the numbers of British people applying for Irish passports has seen “significant percentage increases”. He says the number is typically around 50,000 a year; last year that rose to 70,000. Nicola Sturgeon will promise that Scottish National party MPs at Westminster will vote against any plans to privatise the NHS or cut health spending in England. The pledge will be one of the main offers in the SNP’s general election manifesto as Sturgeon seeks to bolster her party’s claim that its MPs will protect Scottish interests at Westminster. Sturgeon is expected to reject charges that this would contradict the SNP’s promise not to interfere in English spending decisions and will argue that any NHS spending cuts decided in Westminster will automatically reduce Treasury funding for Holyrood. In a further effort to shore up support among urban centre-left voters, Sturgeon is expected to endorse calls for a new 50p top tax rate but only if introduced across the UK. She will call for a £118bn economic stimulus package for the UK economy, protection of the universal winter fuel payments for older people and the end of a long-standing cap of 1% on public sector pay rises. The Tories are pledging to increase health spending in England by £8bn over the next parliament, which would increase Scotland’s grant through its complex funding formula for devolved parliaments. That means the SNP is unlikely to be called upon to vote down English spending cuts, but the pledge to do so is a signal that the party is willing to join an unofficial “progressive alliance” at Westminster with Labour, Plaid Cymru and the Greens. The prime minister, despite repeating her ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’ mantra last night, will today insist that a good Brexit deal is essential for UK prosperity, writes the Guardian’s political editor: Theresa May will claim that “economic prosperity will suffer, jobs and livelihoods will be put at risk, and with them the security and peace of mind of working families” if the government fails to secure a successful Brexit negotiation with the European Union. The prime minister will make the comments in a speech in the West Midlands designed to relaunch her election campaign after the Manchester terrorist attack and division within her party following her U-turn on social care plans. Ramping up the language in her warnings about the high-stakes nature of the talks with the EU27, May will say: If we don’t make a success of Brexit, we won’t have the financial means to fund the public services upon which we all rely. Our National Health Service – the institution which is there for us at the most difficult times – needs us to make a success of Brexit to ensure we can afford to provide it with the resources it needs for the future. Every school in every village, town and city needs us to make a success of Brexit. She will claim that success is vital to ensure a “sustainable welfare system” and to “go on investing in transport infrastructure – our roads and bridges and railways”, adding: “Everything depends on getting Brexit.” Robertson says immigration should become a devolved issue. We need all those people to remain in Scotland … we want people who are currently here to be able to remain. What we certainly don’t want is a restrictive immigration policy imposed on us by Westminster … We don’t want to lose these people. He says SNP rejects the stated Tory policy of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands, saying it would be detrimental to Scotland. Angus Robertson, depute* leader of the SNP and the party’s leader in Westminster, is speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme ahead of the manifesto launch today. He says the key flavour of the manifesto is to take a different course to the Conservative austerity agenda. “Additional tax revenues”, including a UK-wide 50p tax rate, would be one means of changing that course, Robertson says. So why not raise taxes at Holyrood, he is asked. The main economic levers are exercised at Westminster, Robertson says, and this manifesto is about what the SNP wants to do there. He won’t be drawn on why the Scottish government has not gone ahead with such a tax rise under its devolved powers. (* yes, that’s correct) The Labour leader also won support from a less likely backer: Unsurprisingly, both teams thought their own was the star player. Here’s Brexit secretary David Davis, who thought Theresa May was the winner: The prime minister brought it back to the fundamentals – who is going to get the best Brexit deal, and in doing so who will be able to secure our economy, our public services and our national security. Tonight she showed the strength and quiet determination to confront the challenges the country faces and set out the way through them. It was a strong, mature, considered performance. And it couldn’t have been more different to Jeremy Corbyn, who flannelled under pressure and couldn’t get past 30 years of words and deeds that put him on the wrong side of the British people. Au contraire, said a Labour spokesman: Theresa May floundered on her record on police cuts, on funding for our NHS and schools and on her manifesto policy on social care that didn’t last more than a few days before it was amended with an unspecified cap. It’s no surprise she had no answers because the Tories plan to continue the tax giveaways to the wealthy and big business while offering no new funding for public services. There is a clear choice in this election about the kind of country we want Britain to be: between Labour’s plan to transform Britain for the many not the few, and a Conservative party that has held people back and put its wealthy backers first. Welcome back to the morning after the #BattleForNumber10 played out by two people keen not to acknowledge the other’s existence. I’m Claire Phipps to whizz you through what happened last night and set you up for the day ahead. Andrew Sparrow will be along later. Join us in the comments below or find me on Twitter @Claire_Phipps. What we learned Was the Sky News/Channel 4 grilling a game-changer? Was Theresa May “destroyed”? Did Jeremy Corbyn shock us all with this one weird trick? Nah. Check here for Andrew Sparrow’s verdict, but in short: Corbyn seemed relaxed and did better than many expected; May seemed evasive, but left with a round of applause for her EU-thumping final answer. It might have been only a repeat of her “no deal is better than a bad deal” incantation, but it meant she rounded off her appearance with clapping rather than the derisive laughter that met her responses on school funding. So, what did we find out? It’s not about the money … except when it is Quizzed by an audience member on cuts to school funding, May said that wasn’t the issue: People are focusing on funding but we need to ensure that we see more good or outstanding schools. And “people” were getting it wrong again on police cuts, the PM insisted: It’s not about the numbers of police; people often focus on the numbers of police. Even though numbers don’t matter, May wanted the audience to know that Labour’s manifesto “figures don’t add up”. “It’s costed!” was the shouted reply from one audience member. Would-be PMs can’t be expected to know everything, for Pete’s sake Pressed on Labour’s immigration target – which doesn’t exist – Corbyn said he would not put a number on it (so far, so pragmatic). Being accountable does come with the job, however: It would probably – but I don’t want to be held to this – come down. That’s a probability. May had her own “how am I supposed to know this stuff, I’m only the leader of the government” moments. Asked how many pensioners (Labour suggests 10 million) would lose their winter fuel allowance: We need not just pull out a figure in an election campaign. And on whether she knows what that cap on social care costs will be: It’s not about not knowing … it’s about thinking what the right approach is. In the event of nuclear war, Corbyn would write a letter Renewing Trident is in the Labour manifesto, despite the Labour leader’s personal misgivings. Having established that he is “not a dictator”, forcing party underlings to scrawl out a manifesto endorsing mandatory vegetarianism, Corbyn told Jeremy Paxman that he’d really rather not use nuclear weapons (apparently a wildly controversial view), but would, if necessary, “write the appropriate letters to our commanders”. The Queen can rest easy if it’s Corbyn on the way to the palace on 9 June Why, Paxman thundered at the republican Labour leader, is abolishing the monarchy not in the manifesto? Corbyn let us in on the secret: Look, there is nothing in there because we are not going to do it! No Brexit deal is better than a bad deal, but also no deal is a bad deal May’s favourite ultimatum got another airing, but in a speech today she will warn that an unsuccessful Brexit spells doom for the NHS, public services, welfare, jobs and prosperity. Paxman asked the former remainer: “You still believe it’s a duff idea, don’t you?” May said nothing much in reply (this is an evergreen statement). Jeremy Paxman isn’t what he was … He did a decent job of a Jeremy Paxman impression, but the general verdict was that the badgering interruptions and “but most of all, you’ve let me down” mournful face-crumples weren’t cutting it any more. But he did deliver the zinger of the evening, to May: If I was sitting in Brussels and I was looking at you as the person I had to negotiate with, I’d think ‘she’s a blowhard who collapses at the first sign of gunfire’. … and the audience were the winners Twitter, of course, exists for these events. But after this audience member’s response to May defending government spending on the NHS, the media today will be in search of “bollocks man” (although only the Guardian will be able to do so without employing asterisks. Just part of our unique journalistic offering). What else is happening? Today we see the SNP manifesto, delayed for a week after the Manchester attack. The party is lounging comfortably atop the polls in Scotland, but defending 56 of 59 Westminster seats (and under pressure from a perkier Scottish Conservative party) means that even a win on 8 June is likely to come with a few losses. Nicola Sturgeon will today stress the party’s commitment to counter austerity measures, promising her MPs would vote against cuts to health spending in England – a nod to that notional progressive alliance – as well as pledging to scrap the 1% public sector pay cap, keep winter fuel payments as a universal pensioner benefit, and add a 50p top tax rate (as long as the rest of the UK joined in). Read a full rundown here. At a glance: Dominic Raab accused of ‘stupid and offensive’ food bank comments. Ukip braces for a tough election fight, even in its heartlands. Tory candidate for Jo Cox seat apologises for gun joke at hustings. Charities say ‘gag law’ stops them speaking out on Tory social care plans. Listen to Monday’s Election Daily podcast; later today, Sonia Sodha joins Jonathan Freedland and Owen Jones to pick a not-a-debate winner. Poll position Yesterday’s Survation poll for ITV’s Good Morning Britain joined the ranks of those slicing the Tory lead over Labour: this time, to six points. The Conservatives were stuck on 43%, Labour hopped up three points to 37%, and the Lib Dems and Ukip stayed right where they were, on 8% and 4% respectively. And in a sign that Corbyn’s comments on security might not have been the misstep painted by his opponents (including Boris Johnson, who, of course, had said the very same thing), the Survation poll found 46% thought UK military interventions overseas did increase the risk of terror attacks at home; 14% thought the opposite. Diary At 10am, Jeremy Corbyn is interviewed on Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour; at midday he does a Mumsnet webchat. At 10.30, Caroline Lucas targets the Tories and Labour over their lack of green policies in a series of events in London. At 2.30pm, disability minister Penny Mordaunt joins other party candidates for a hustings on disability issues in Westminster. Theresa May will switch the Tory campaign off and on again with a reboot speech focusing on Brexit. And the SNP manifesto is unveiled by Nicola Sturgeon in Perth. Read these First, John Crace, in the Guardian. Of course: When Jeremy Paxman interviewed Jeremy Corbyn earlier in the evening, he had looked and behaved like a man hellbent on acting as a parody of himself. He had interrupted the Labour leader at every opportunity and turned what should have been forensic questioning into a TV turnoff. Someone had clearly had a word with him in the break and he did at least make an effort to let the Supreme Leader get a word in edgeways. Not necessarily to the viewers’ advantage as she continued to do her level best to say nothing at all. ‘You’ve basically changed your mind about everything,’ he concluded after listing all the U-turns the Maybot had made in the last few years. ‘An EU negotiator would conclude that you are a blowhard who collapses at the first sign of gunfire.’ It was Paxman’s one telling intervention of the entire evening. The Supreme Leader narrowed her eyes into a death stare at the sound of more laughter. She then just went back to saying nothing at length until she could hear the studio manager call time. Rachel Sylvester, in the Times, says the Tory over-reliance on scare tactics is not working: Wavering former Labour supporters, who were flirting with voting Tory for the first time, are being pushed back into the Labour fold. Voters – who actually rather like the populist policies in Mr Corbyn’s manifesto – feel insulted. The Tories are starting to look like bullies. By attempting to highlight Labour’s failings they are simply reinforcing their own flaws … For all his left-wing views, the jam-making, courgette-growing, bearded Labour leader looks like a herbivore while the Tory one increasingly appears red in tooth and claw, not only carnivorous but cannibalistic in her mauling of her rival. There is, as she herself might say, something distinctly ‘nasty’ about the Conservative strategy. Revelation of the day Paul Nuttall denied he and Ukip were becoming extreme, as he told the BBC’s Andrew Neil he’d consider internment without trial for those suspected of involvement in terrorism, and would be willing personally to “pull the lever” to execute child murderers if the death penalty were reintroduced. “We’re saying things that people are thinking,” Nuttall insisted, “people” presumably including those old school friends you’ve had to mute on Facebook.

As hopes of a breakthrough soared, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, is to travel to Switzerland on Friday to help seal an agreement which could, if successful, go a long way towards defusing tensions in the Gulf and put off the threat of new war in the Middle East. A senior US state department official said: \"Secretary Kerry will travel to Geneva, Switzerland, on Friday at the invitation of EU high representative Ashton in an effort to help narrow differences in negotiations.\" It was not clear if his British counterpart, William Hague, was also considering attending the talks. Speaking during a break in the talks, Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said it was quite possible that the agreement would be finished by the end of Friday, but that much would rely on the contribution of western diplomats. \"Depending on what they put on paper with us, we can decide whether it's a major deal or a small step in the right direction. I hope its more than a small step in the right direction, but I'll be happy if we move in the right direction,\" Zarif said. An agreement on any scale would represent a historic breakthrough after a decade of diplomatic sparring marked by paralysis and distrust. Zarif said the process of drafting would begin on Friday morning at a meeting with the EU foreign policy chief, Lady Ashton, who acts as a convenor for the six world powers with delegations in Geneva: the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China. \"I believe the ingredients are there. I believe there is a general understanding of everyone involved, but it is important at the same time to start doing things in black and white and try to move forward with the text,\" Zarif said. The two days of talks in Geneva brought together Iran and six global powers to discuss the future of Iran's nuclear programme. Western officials agreed that drafting work could begin on Saturday, but cautioned that there were still many difficult issues to resolve. Zarif said the six other nations in Geneva had agreed to Iran's initial multi-phase plan: a statement of intent encompassing an initial confidence-building measure as a first, and an outline of the ultimate goal of a comprehensive agreement on Iran's nuclear programme and normalisation of relations between Tehran and the west. The foreign minister said negotiations had gone further in the first day than agreeing a framework. \"We have gone beyond that and we have agreed on the elements that have to be incorporated in each one of these [steps]. The manner in which we incorporate them and the balance we strike between these elements – that's the sort of question we have to answer tomorrow,\" he said. It is widely expected that both an interim deal and a longer-term settlement would involve western acceptance of Iran's enrichment programme in return for Iranian acceptance of limits on its scope, particularly a cap on the level to which it could enrich uranium of about 5%, sufficient for fuel for nuclear power stations. There would also have to be an agreement on how far Iran could go in developing a heavy-water reactor at Arak, which would produce plutonium, and on Iranian acceptance of extensive and intrusive inspections by the international watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As the negotiations proceeded in Geneva, the Israeli premier, Binyamin Netanyahu, warned against any agreement that left the Iranian nuclear programme in place. He said: \"I believe adopting the proposals is a mistake of historic proportions. They must be rejected outright.\" Asked about Netanyahu's comments, Zarif said: \"I don't think he's an authority on mistakes because he's been making mistakes for his entire life. He's been calling the Iranian programme six months away from a nuclear weapon since 1991, so I don't consider him a credible authority.\" On the reception a nuclear bargain is likely to receive in Iran, the foreign minister said: \"It depends on the type of deal that we get. The Iranian public is very sceptical about the process and I believe rightly so because we haven't had a very positive experience in the past. \"What is important is to prepare a solid agreement that all sides can be happy with and all sides can sell to their populations. For Iran, because it is our right. Its our programme, it is important that it is respectful and based on equal footing, and I believe we can sell it to the public. If we can't, I don't think we should agree to it.\" Zarif is not the only participant in the Geneva talks likely to face resistance back home. In Washington on Thursday, the US Senate said it would move ahead with a debate on tough new sanctions on Iran after the Geneva meeting was over. Some senators have said they would consider loosening the sanctions regime, but only in return for dramatic concessions from Tehran. In another sign of progress, Zarif said the head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, would visit Tehran on Monday, raising expectations of a breakthrough in long-running talks between the Iranian government and the agency aimed at clearing up uncertainty over Iran's past development work on nuclear weapons. Zarif said: \"Mr Amano's visit is going to be an important indication that we are in process in moving forward.\" His optimistic remarks followed a full meeting of all the delegates and then separate discussions between Iranian officials with diplomats from the US, Russia and China, and one with representatives of the three European states. British and Iranian diplomats discussed the eventual appointment of non-resident chargés d'affaires in each other's countries. Zarif had cancelled a trip to Rome so that he could hold a face-to-face meeting with Ashton as it became clear that substantial progress was being made. \"In response to a first step agreed to by Iran that halts their programme from advancing further, we are prepared to offer limited, targeted and reversible sanctions relief,\" a senior US official said before the talks began. \"We are not talking about touching the core architecture of the Iranian sanctions regime in this first step in any way. And if Iran does not live up to its obligations under the initial understanding, or if we cannot get a comprehensive agreement finalised, any economic relief we will have given Iran can, in fact, be reversed.\" Issues to be resolved • Iran's right to enrich uranium as part of its nuclear programme • The limits to enrichment. Likely to be under 5% – enough to fuel nuclear power stations • Future of the heavy water reactor being built in Arak, which could produce plutonium • Iran's agreement to the IAEA additional protocol, which involves more intrusive nuclear inspections • Iran's stockpile of medium-enriched (20%) uranium, which could be turned into reactor fuel so that it would be less of a proliferation risk. • Possible caps on the amount of low enriched uranium produced or on the number and efficiency of centrifuges • Fate of the underground enrichment plant at Fordow – whether it should be closed and mothballed or simply placed under intense monitoring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/04/chinese-energy-group-horizon-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-04T17:11:50Z","webTitle":"Chinese state energy group eyes up UK's Horizon nuclear venture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/04/chinese-energy-group-horizon-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/04/chinese-energy-group-horizon-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Chinese state energy group eyes up UK's Horizon nuclear venture","bodyText":"It seems Chinese companies cannot get enough of British sources of slow-burn energy. After China's state-owned Bright Food bought Weetabix on Thursday, on Friday another Chinese group was linked with the potential purchase of Horizon Nuclear Power. Horizon had been planning to invest more than £10bn in new atomic plants in Gloucestershire and north Wales. State-owned China Guangdong Nuclear Power is said to be working on developing a consortium with Toshiba of Japan, through that company's subsidiary Westinghouse, the nuclear engineering business, to bid for Horizon. Another Chinese group, the State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation, is also linked to the Westinghouse consortium, according to the Financial Times. \"China is an obvious potential buyer,\" one British nuclear industry executive told the Guardian. \"It has deep pockets and the ambition to make something like this work.\" China plans to construct a huge number of new nuclear plants on its own territory, to replace some of its old and heavily polluting coal plants. The state-owned Chinese companies are flush with cash and the government has been keen to invest in a wide group of markets while prices are depressed and long-term returns look steady. The speculation follows indications that a Russian state nuclear company might be interested in Horizon. It will ring alarm bells in Whitehall about the wisdom of selling off strategic energy assets to nations considered to mix commercial and political ambitions overseas. George Osborne, the chancellor, has been keen to attract Chinese investment in infrastructure projects, while Shanghai-based Bright Food agreed to pay £720m for a 60% stake in Weetabix and is thought to be eyeing other food operations, such as Premier Foods, the makers of Mr Kipling cakes, and Loyd Grossman sauces. China Guangdong Nuclear Power recently took over London-based uranium miner Kalahari Minerals, while PetroChina invested last year in the huge Scottish oil refinery complex at Grangemouth. The Horizon holding is being disposed of by German utilities E.ON and RWE npower which have been discouraged from going ahead with new plants at Oldbury-on-Severn and Wylfa because of the rising cost of building nuclear in Britain at a time when their home country has decided to phase out atomic plants in reaction to the Fukushima disaster. The vendors have signed up the London-based arm of Japanese finance house Nomura to find a buyer as quickly as possible in the hope that Horizon can stick to its target of building new reactors by 2020. The decision by E.ON and RWE in March to pull out of Horizon was a blow to the British government which is keen to ensure a new generation of power plants can take over from ones nearing the end of their lives. Last week GDF Suez, a French company, warned ministers that it needed better incentives if it was going to proceed with plans to build a new reactor at Sellafield in Cumbria. An exit by GDF and Horizon would risk leaving EDF, the largely French state-owned power group, as the only one committed to new plants. EDF's British partner, Centrica, is considering its options over nuclear while the French group itself could be driven off course by an expected change of president in its home country. François Hollande, the socialist candidate and likely winner of this weekend's elections for the Elysée Palace, is committed to a dramatic contraction of the country's nuclear industry which could land EDF with a costly decommissioning and closure bill. The government and the power companies are in crucial talks to decide the price at which they can sell electricity from non-fossil fuel sources. Once a level has been agreed, the companies are guaranteed a subsidy from the Government if energy prices slump. However, if prices soar and they make big profits, they must pay back the difference. In either case, power companies need the certainty of regular revenue to make the initial investment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2013/sep/23/ronald-bishop-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-23T14:15:04Z","webTitle":"Ronald Bishop obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/23/ronald-bishop-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2013/sep/23/ronald-bishop-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Ronald Bishop obituary","bodyText":"My husband, Ronald Bishop, who has died aged 91, was an inventor, industrialist and philanthropist. He also had a great love of life. The son of Reginald, an engineer, and his wife, Clara, Ronnie arrived at Clare College, Cambridge, aged just 17. A double first in engineering launched him into the world of future Nobel laureates; during the second world war he worked on armour plating for tanks with the distinguished scientist Nevill Mott. Much of his life was spent in the north-east of England, beginning in research and development at the engineering firm Whessoe. After several years working on oil storage vessels in Canada, he eventually became managing director of Whessoe and an important employer of skilled labour in Darlington and Stockton. His inventions led to numerous patents used in nuclear power stations, oil storage and oil rigs. He led trade delegations all over the world, including one to China in the 1980s. His contribution to the north-east, where he chaired the North-East Industrial Development Board, which provided regeneration advice and grants, led to him being appointed CBE in 1987. In retirement, he served as a non-executive director of Girobank and was a college governor at Durham University's Hatfield College, where he was elected a fellow in 1998. He maintained his ties with Clare College, where he was a generous benefactor. His philanthropy developed links between the dioceses of Durham and Lesotho, in southern Africa, and he raised £1m to rebuild the parish centre at All Saints and Salutation in Darlington, the church he served for many years as an active layman. Ronnie was a man of passionate commitment: to cricket and to fly-fishing, to ideas and to friendship, to whisky and to wine, and above all to his family. The death of his first wife, Barbara, in 1997, after 49 years, left him even closer to his son, Christopher, and his grandsons. We married in 2000 and enjoyed great happiness together. Ronnie continued to entrance adults and children alike with ingenious projects and grand constructions (tree houses taking over from oil rigs). An inspiring man whose courtesy never left him, he led a full life which enriched many people. He is survived by me, Christopher and his grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/feb/18/scientists-worried-ipcc-underestimate-sea-level-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-18T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"Vision Prize: scientists are worried the IPCC is underestimating sea level rise | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/feb/18/scientists-worried-ipcc-underestimate-sea-level-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/feb/18/scientists-worried-ipcc-underestimate-sea-level-rise","fields":{"headline":"Vision Prize: scientists are worried the IPCC is underestimating sea level rise","bodyText":"The Vision Prize is an online survey of scientists about climate risk. It's an impartial and independent research platform for incentivized polling of experts on important scientific issues that are relevant to policymakers. Some of their previous survey results have found that about 90 percent of participating scientists believe that humans are the primary cause of global warming over the past 250 years. In its latest survey, the Vision Prize asked participants questions about technologies to limit climate change, and about the latest IPCC report. Two of these questions asked about the likelihood that global average sea level will rise less than the IPCC lowest estimate (0.25 meters, or 10 inches), or more than the IPCC highest estimate (0.91 meters, or 3 feet) by 2100. These estimates are about 60 percent higher than in the 2007 IPCC report, which intentionally left out dynamic processes that cause effects like the calving of ice shelves into the ocean, because at the time they were not well understood. As expected, research has shown that the previous IPCC report underestimated the rate of sea level rise. The Vision Prize results revealed that despite the much higher sea level rise estimates this time around, the survey participants are worried that the IPCC is still underestimating future sea level rise. 41 percent responded that it's likely or very likely that sea level rise will exceed the IPCC highest estimate, and 71 percent answering that it's at least as likely as not. Conversely, only 5 percent responded that it's likely sea level rise will be less than the IPCC lowest estimate, and 83 percent called this scenario unlikely. These results broadly agree with a recent survey carried out by scientists in Germany and the US. In this survey, 90 researchers who'd published sea level research in the last 5 years concluded that sea level rise by 2100 is likely to be between 0.7 and 1.2 meters if we continue on a business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions path. Two-thirds of the experts responded that sea level could rise more than the upper end of the IPCC's projected range by 2100, consistent with the Vision Prize survey results. On the other hand, if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced strongly, the experts expected sea level rise to be between 0.4 and 0.6 meters by 2100. These results suggest that the Vision Prize participants may be pessimistic that we'll transition away from a business-as-usual emissions path. Another Vision Prize question asked about the IPCC estimate of the planet's sensitivity to the increased greenhouse effect. The latest IPCC report estimated that the planet will eventually warm between 1.5 and 4.5°C in response to the increased greenhouse effect if the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles. The 2007 IPCC report put the estimate at 2 to 4.5°C, but the three IPCC reports before that and the 1979 Charney Report had all estimated a 1.5 to 4.5°C climate sensitivity. In the Wall Street Journal, climate contrarian Matt Ridley claimed that the change from the 2007 report to the latest version, \"...points to the very real possibility that, over the next several generations, the overall effect of climate change will be positive for humankind and the planet.\" Vision Prize participants were asked whether they agreed with this interpretation of the revised IPCC estimate. 72 percent strongly disagreed, 87 percent disagreed, and only 9 percent agreed with Ridley's interpretation. Although the lower end of the estimated climate sensitivity range decreased back to a value consistent with expert estimates made between 1979 and 2007, this in no way suggests that climate change might be beneficial. In terms of climate solutions, the latest Vision Prize poll reveals that carbon capture and storage is not thought likely to have a short-term impact. Just 16 percent of those surveyed believe the technology will measurably affect the global climate by 2050, and only 4 percent would choose this approach as a top priority for large private investment attempting to avoid dangerous levels of global warming. When it came to this type of spending, distributed renewables were the most popular choice, closely followed by energy efficiency. In third place was next-generation nuclear power. The majority of Vision Prize participants are academics with expertise relevant to climate science. For more from the poll, including views on the chances of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations reaching double pre-industrial levels by 2100, see the Vision Prize website. Overall these results indicate that scientists are pessimistic that we'll take sufficient steps to avoid dangerous levels of global warming and sea level rise. They don't agree with the unjustifiably optimistic view of Matt Ridley and his fellow climate contrarians. They also appear to believe that deploying existing low-emissions technologies should be a top priority in mitigating the threats posed by human-caused climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/aug/09/fukushima-disaster-new-geothermal-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-09T14:32:12Z","webTitle":"Fukushima disaster paves way for new geothermal plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/09/fukushima-disaster-new-geothermal-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/aug/09/fukushima-disaster-new-geothermal-plants","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima disaster paves way for new geothermal plants","bodyText":"Before last year's triple disaster in north-east Japan, Tsuchiyu Onsen drew tens of thousands of tourists in search of the recuperative qualities of its piping hot spring water. Almost 18 months after the nuclear accident at nearby Fukushima Daiichi power plant, that same natural resource is about to turn this spa resort into a trailblazer for the country's push towards renewable energy. By spring 2014, Tsuchiyu, 9 miles (15km) from Fukushima, will be generating 250 kilowatts of electricity – about a quarter of the city's total needs – at a geothermal plant hidden away in the surrounding mountains. The plant will be the first to be built inside a national park, a controversial move that only became possible after the environment ministry recently relaxed regulations on developing protected areas. If all goes to plan, the project could not only help the town become self-sufficient in power generation, but revive its role as a tourist destination after visitor numbers plummeted amid lingering fears over radiation. In the past, hot-spring operators have been among the fiercest opponents of geothermal energy, an obvious source of energy given Japan's huge subterranean reserves of volcanic water. Many fear the plants would affect the flow and quality of the water, which is pumped up from the depths and then cooled for the benefit of Japan's enthusiastic bathers. In Tsuchiyu, however, where half a dozen hotels remain closed with earthquake damage, spa owners are among the new geothermal generator's keenest backers. \"The plant won't affect the water quality or the temperature,\" said Kazuya Ikeda, general manager of the Tsuchiyu Onsen Tourist Association. \"We have surveyed opinion in the town, and no one has raised any objections.\" The move also makes economic sense. Under a new feed-in tariff system introduced last month, utilities are required to pay premium prices for renewable energy – 42 yen (34p) per kilowatt for geothermal power. \"The structure itself will be quite small and unobtrusive,\" Ikeda added. \"And with the feed-in tariff, we should be able to cover our initial costs in about seven years.\" The 300m-yen (£2.5m) facility will use water pumped from below ground and combine it with an ammonia-like substance with a lower boiling point than water to propel a turbine. Resistance to geothermal power, coupled with the pre-Fukushima faith in nuclear, means that until now Japan has failed to tap into a resource that energy experts believe has huge potential. Its 18 geothermal plants account for 0.2% of electricity output, according to the trade and industry ministry, and no new plants have been built for a decade. Scientists believe the sector's share could rise enormously thanks to the feed-in tariff, new subsidies to fund feasibility studies and test-drilling, and official recognition that nuclear's heyday has passed. According to one estimate, Japan's gGeothermal capacity could reach 24m kilowatts – the third biggest in the world after the US and Indonesia – compared with less than 550,000 kilowatts now. Tsuchiyu has other compelling reasons to embrace geothermal power. Visitor numbers dropped dramatically after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and while a recovery is under way, fears of radiation persist, even though recorded levels here pose no health threat. Profits from the venture will be used to repair three damaged hotels and rebuild three others that were destroyed in the earthquake. In the long term, Ikeda believes Tsuchiyu will become a model for other small towns struggling to find clean and stable sources of energy, while experts debate if nuclear has any role to play in Japan's future energy mix. If the experiment works, it should allay anxiety among other Onsen operators about potential damage to hot-spring water flows – the financial lifeblood of countless similar resorts around Japan. Eventually, the geothermal plant will be capable of generating 1,000 kilowatts, according to Ikeda. That is a tiny fraction of the capacity of just one of Fukushima Daiichi's now crippled reactors. But with opposition to nuclear restarts unlikely to waver, towns such as Tsuchiyu have no choice but to turn to alternatives, he said. \"If it hadn't been for the nuclear disaster, we would never have given this project a second thought.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/sep/30/george-osborne-green-economy-stupid","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-30T14:23:00Z","webTitle":"Memo to Osborne: It's the green economy, stupid | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/sep/30/george-osborne-green-economy-stupid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/sep/30/george-osborne-green-economy-stupid","fields":{"headline":"Memo to Osborne: It's the green economy, stupid","bodyText":"In 2007, George Osborne said this: \"Rather than green policies stifling economic growth, it is clear that the converse is true: a strong economy can go hand in hand with environmentalism. Britain is falling far behind other countries when it comes to taking advantage of the vast new green technologies market.\" But the electoral arithmetic has changed since the Conservatives failed to win an outright majority in 2012, and the Chancellor's main concern now seems to be keeping the climate change sceptic fringe of his party onside. The really stunning thing, however, is how in his speech to the Conservative party conference on Monday, Osborne repeatedly applied the no-brainer logic of investing for the future and keeping at the forefront of science and innovation to every sector of the economy bar the green one. It is truly stunning because the green economy is growing fast around the world and already employs more people in the UK than teaching. And it beggars belief, just days after a landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report concluded that much of the existing fossil fuel reserves will have to stay in the ground to avoid climate chaos. Consider the following. Osborne said on Monday: \"It is not enough to clear up the mess afterwards. They did not fix the roof when the sun was shining, let's never make that mistake again.\" He was talking about the Labour government actions before the 2008 financial crash, but exactly the same argument applies to curbing and preparing for climate change. Osborne said in his speech: \"I don't want to see other countries pushing the frontiers of science and big innovation and say to my children: that used to be us.\" But when it comes to the green economy, Osborne thinks Britain should not be \"in front of the rest of the world\". Even his climate sceptic cabinet colleague, environment secretary Owen Paterson, sees the big \"business opportunities\" that acting on climate change presents. \"The UK is already one of the global leaders in this industry of the future and this market [for climate adaptation] is expected to grow by 5% or more year on year,\" said Paterson in July. \"Managing our natural resources in innovative ways is backed by the kind of world class science and engineering skills that we can be proud to equip the UK to succeed in the global race.\" Instead, when it comes discussing to the green sector, the only examples Osborne can muster to mention are aluminium smelters, nuclear power stations and a gas-guzzling 1,000mph car: hardly the industries of the future. There's more. Osborne told party delegates on Monday: \"I am going to stop the tendency that says 'stop the world, I want to get off'.\" He wasn't talking about those who choose to deny the risk that climate change poses, but the words fit perfectly. There were telling contradictions in the details too. \"Should the nation which built the first civilian nuclear power station say we are never going to do that again? Not on my watch,\" said Osborne, dropping a heavy hint that the government will settle with EDF in its haggle over how much the public will pay for new reactors at Hinkley Point. But he did not mention that it will not be the UK that builds the new reactors, but a French state-owned company in probable partnership with China or Russia. The nuclear industry doesn't even have a bright past, let alone a bright future and companies have already decided the investment numbers don't add up without state backing. Osborne derided Ed Miliband's pledge to freeze consumer energy bills for 20 months as a \"back of the fag packet policy\" that would drive up short-term prices and hinder investment, therefore driving prices up in the long term too. This is very rich from the man who, through his anti-green statements and actions since 2010, has done more than anyone to drive up the cost of capital for nervous energy investors. Osborne told the conference: \"We will continue to invest in our country's essential infrastructure\" but forgot to mention energy alongside roads, railways and science. He also forgot to mention that David Cameron's own pledge on energy bills – to force companies to put customers on the lowest tariffs – didn't even benefit from fag packet analysis: it was a slip of the tongue at prime minister's question time. The chancellor's contorted logic pervades his approach to energy and the environment. We learned from former energy and climate change secretary Chris Huhne today that the Treasury blocked serious financial incentives to support the struggling Green deal, the coalition's flagship energy-efficiency policy and the one certain way to cut people's energy bills. Worse, the scaremongering from the big six energy companies after Miliband's price freeze proposal led Osborne to indicate that he'll cut green taxes starting reportedly with the Energy Companies Obligation (ECO) scheme that improves the leaky homes of the poorest in society – the very people least able to pay their utility bills. On Monday, investors managing a trillion dollars of funds called for Osborne to back a target to make the UK's electricity system carbon-free by 2030, in order to provide longer-term certainty for investors in new generation capacity. But Osborne lampooned the 2030 target, backed by both Lib Dems and Labour, as \"too fast and too dogmatic\". Seriously, too fast! Believing one thing while arguing another is, unfortunately, a skill many politicians have at times to deploy. But in this case, Osborne's wilful blindness to the green economy, despite it ticking every box he demands for every other economic policy, is doing great harm to the \"Britain of the future\" that he said on Monday he wants to build. Osborne should take heed of a speaker who preceded him on the same conference podium on Monday morning and be reminded of something he once said he believed: \"For too long, we have allowed the lazy assumption that the environment and growth are incompatible objectives.\" The words of none other than windmill-hating, fracking enthusiast Owen Paterson."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2013/nov/16/film-festival-previews-utopia","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-16T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Utopia And John Pilger Q&A, Framed: film festival previews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/16/film-festival-previews-utopia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2013/nov/16/film-festival-previews-utopia","fields":{"headline":"Utopia And John Pilger Q&A, Framed: film festival previews","bodyText":"Utopia And John Pilger Q&amp;A, Nationwide You can always trust John Pilger to tell it like it is, though many in his homeland won't thank him for it after seeing his latest documentary.

Abe, who recently suggested that the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), was incapable of overseeing the operation on its own, said the government would soon announce a comprehensive plan to deal with the world's largest nuclear cleanup. The prospect of greater state involvement in decommissioning Fukushima Daiichi – the scene of a triple meltdown after it was hit by a tsunami in March 2011 – comes amid growing concern that Tepco is ill-equipped to cope with the scale and complexity of the cleanup. Those doubts were fuelled by evidence that the plant is seeping up to 300 tonnes of contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean every day. In a separate incident, a water storage tank was found to have leaked about 300 tonnes of highly toxic water, some of which could have found its way into the sea. At the weekend, radiation near another tank was measured at 1,800 millisieverts an hour – a level that could kill an unprotected person in just four hours – and 18 times higher than previously thought. Tepco had initially recorded radiation near the tank at about 100 millisieverts an hour, but admitted that this was because the equipment used could only read measurements up to that level. The latest reading came from a more advanced device capable of reading up to 10,000 millisieverts. The buildup of water at the site is close to becoming unmanageable. Experts say that Tepco will soon be left with no choice but to release the water into the ocean or evaporate it. At present, water is used to cool melted nuclear fuel in three reactor basements, where it becomes contaminated and then mixes with groundwater seeping down from the hills behind the plant. The site's tanks, basements and pits contain an estimated 338,000 tonnes of tainted water. The chairman of the country's nuclear regulation authority, Shunichi Tanaka, said on Monday that discharging the water remained an option, but only after it had been treated to bring radiation levels to below regulatory limits. \"If we decide to discharge water into the ocean, we will use various methods to ensure that radiation is below accepted levels,\" Tanaka told reporters in Tokyo. \"We will have to dispose of it eventually, but we are committed to reducing or removing radioactive materials. \"There are specific limits that are used worldwide for the discharge of contaminated water. Nuclear power plants do that under normal circumstances – we're not asking for an exception to be made in Fukushima's case.\" Tanaka said monitoring of the more than 1,000 water tanks at the site had been \"inadequate\". Previously, only two workers were dispatched twice a day to check the tanks, but did not carry personal radiation monitors and failed to keep proper records of their inspections. Tanaka said that a small leak and signs of possible leaks had been spotted at several other storage tanks. Tepco apologised for the \"great anxiety and inconvenience\" caused by the contaminated water. But the utility took issue with media reports suggesting workers at the site were at risk of being irradiated. Most of the radiation in the most recent incident – measured at 1,800 millisieverts an hour – was emitted in the form of beta rays, it said. Beta radiation travels only a short distance and can be blocked by a thin sheet of metal, such as aluminium, it added. \"We believe that we can control radiation exposure by the using proper equipment and clothing,\" the firm said in an emailed statement. \"We will investigate the cause of this issue, taking any appropriate countermeasures immediately, and continue to make every effort to secure the safety of workers.\" The government is expected to unveil emergency measures on Tuesday to deal with the water crisis. The plan will include steps to prevent a further buildup of contaminated water, possibly financed by the state, media reports said. Abe has come under pressure from his party's coalition partner to intervene at Fukushima Daiichi. The toxic water leaks were \"very serious\", Kyodo quoted New Komeito's leader, Natsuo Yamaguchi, as telling Abe at a meeting on Monday. \"I want the government to deal with the problem in a comprehensive manner.\" The leaks threaten to delay Abe's plans to restart nuclear reactors, a move he says is necessary to support Japan's economic recovery and improve Tepco's tattered finances. Of Japan's 50 working nuclear reactors, only two are in operation. One of those was to be shut down on Monday evening to undergo routine checks, the other will go offline on 15 September, leaving Japan without atomic energy for only the second time in almost 50 years. Concern is growing that the stream of bad news from Fukushima could threaten Tokyo's bid to host the 2020 Olympics. The International Olympic Committee will announce the host city – the two other candidates are Madrid and Istanbul – in Buenos Aires on Saturday. Japan's foreign ministry has started posting English-language information online showing that atmospheric radiation levels in Tokyo, 140 miles south of Fukushima Daiichi, are comparable with those in London and New York."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/oct/29/cameron-britain-infrastructure-foreign-ownership","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-29T15:39:36Z","webTitle":"Cameron: UK should be open to selling more infrastructure to foreign owners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/29/cameron-britain-infrastructure-foreign-ownership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/oct/29/cameron-britain-infrastructure-foreign-ownership","fields":{"headline":"Cameron: UK should be open to selling more infrastructure to foreign owners","bodyText":"Britain should not be afraid of selling off more of its major national infrastructure to foreign owners, David Cameron has said. The prime minister dismissed concerns about letting overseas governments own big buildings, energy projects and football clubs as he spoke at an Islamic investment conference in London. He made the case for foreign ownership a week after the government said it was happy for a stake in new nuclear power stations to be sold to a Chinese state firm. Speaking to 1,800 delegates, he said opening up the market to overseas investors helps create wealth and promised the UK would not \"pull up the drawbridge\" like other countries. \"I know some people look at foreign companies investing in our businesses, financing our infrastructure or taking over our football clubs and ask – shouldn't we do something to stop it?\" he said. \"Well, let me tell you, the answer is 'no'. One of Britain's unique selling points is its openness and this openness is a vital part of how we ensure our country is a great success story in the global race. \"Foreign investment creates wealth, jobs and growth. And far from weakening our industrial base, that investment actually strengthens it.\" He said the government was proud Dubai-based DP World had invested in the London Gateway, one of Europe's biggest ports; Qatar in the tallest building in Europe, the Shard; Emirates in a new stadium for Arsenal; Etihad in Manchester City, Malaysia in Battersea power station and Masdar in the London Array offshore windfarm. \"We welcome the fact that Thames Water, Barclays, Sainsbury's, Harrods and the Olympic Village are all financed in part by Islamic investors,\" he said. During the conference, Cameron also pledged to make London one of the world's \"great capitals of Islamic finance\" by unveiling a Treasury plan to create a £200m Islamic bond by early next year. The Sukuk bond will comply with Islamic law and investment principles that prohibit lenders from charging interest. In a speech to the first meeting of the World Islamic Economic Forum to be held outside a Muslim country, he also revealed plans by the London Stock Exchange to launch the first Islamic market index. Speaking at the conference, he said: \"I don't just want London to be a great capital of Islamic finance in the western world; I want London to stand alongside Dubai as one of the great capitals of Islamic finance anywhere in the world. There are some countries which naturally look inwards, pull up the drawbridge and refuse to recognise that the way the world is changing affects their future success. But Britain will not make that mistake.\" He said he never again wanted a Muslim student to be excluded from university nor Muslim entrepreneurs to be unable to get a startup loan because they were not compliant with Islamic finance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/apr/23/eight-major-uk-renewable-energy-projects-receive-government-backing","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-23T07:54:52Z","webTitle":"Eight major UK renewable energy projects receive government backing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/23/eight-major-uk-renewable-energy-projects-receive-government-backing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/apr/23/eight-major-uk-renewable-energy-projects-receive-government-backing","fields":{"headline":"Eight major UK renewable energy projects receive government backing","bodyText":"The UK government has agreed deals to financially support eight major new renewable energy projects that will power millions of homes. Five of the schemes are offshore windfarms, which the Conservative party plans to back in its general election manifesto over cheaper but more controversial onshore wind power. The projects will create 8,500 jobs and add 4.5GW of electricity capacity to the national grid, around 4% of the UK's generating capacity, or enough to power more than 3 million homes. The projects were worth up to £12bn in private sector investment, the government said. The combined projects are expected to add 2% to an average household electricity bill by 2020, or £11 per household, but energy and climate secretary, Ed Davey, said the government's \"whole package\" on energy reforms would ultimately lower consumer energy bills. Davey said: “These contracts for major renewable electricity projects mark a new stage in Britain’s green energy investment boom. By themselves they will bring green jobs and growth across the UK, but they are a significant part of our efforts to give Britain cleaner and more secure energy.\" “These are the first investments from our reforms to build the world’s first low carbon electricity market – reforms which will see competition and markets attract tens of billions of pounds of vital energy investment whilst reducing the costs of clean energy to consumers.\" The agreements are part of a transition to a new subsidy regime, with the old one being phased out in 2017. The deals agreed today are known as investment contracts and are an early form of the new \"contracts for difference\", which offer low-carbon generators a guaranteed price for their electricity. A similar contract for difference was agreed last year for the first nuclear power plant in the UK in decades, at Hinkley point in Somerset. Industry welcomed the deals but said the UK needed more onshore windfarms, which the Tories are considering capping. Maf Smith, deputy chief executive of trade body RenewableUK, said: \"We’re pleased to see this vote in confidence for these five offshore wind projects, which will make an important contribution to keeping the lights on, and create much-needed growth in coastal areas.\" \"However, we need far more onshore and offshore wind projects over the next decade if we’re not to find our energy security threatened, and the UK further exposed to price shocks from imported fossil fuels, so it’s important that the contracts for difference regime works for all renewable energy projects, not just those that have secured early contracts.\" The offshore wind projects include Dong Energy's 250MW Burbo Bank extension in Liverpool Bay, Statoil/Statkraft's 400MW Dudgeon off the coast of Norfolk, a consortium-backed 1.2GW windfarm off the coast of Yorkshire, Dong Energy's 660MW extension off the coast of Cumbria. 1.7m, and the 664MW Beatrice windfarm in the Outer Moray Firth in Scotland. Three biomass projects have also been given the green light, including a conversion of one part of Britain's biggest coal power plant, Drax in North Yorkshire, plus Lynemouth Power Station in Northumberland and MGT's Teesside plan at Middlesborough. A contract for a second unit at Drax was turned down, however, leading its owner on Wednesday to announce legal proceedings against the government. Dorothy Thompson, chief executive of Drax, said: \"Whilst we are pleased to have been offered an investment contract for our third unit conversion, we are disappointed by today’s decision on the ineligibility of our second unit. Sustainable biomass provides a very reliable, flexible and cost effective renewable power source for the UK consumer.\" Drax's AGM in London was met by anti-biomass protesters on Wednesday, with three campaigners being removed from the meeting after unfurling a banner. Oliver Munnion, a campaigner at the group Biofuelwatch, said: “Drax’s conversion actually allows it to burn more coal long into the future. Even after the conversion they’ll be burning some 3.7 million tonnes of coal every year from opencast mines in the UK and imported from places like Colombia, where communities have been forced off their land for expanding mines. Biomass isn't about renewable energy, it's about keeping old, polluting power stations running, when they should be closing down.” Davey took a shot at the previous Labour government's record on renewable energy, saying: \"Record levels of energy investment are at the forefront of the government’s infrastructure programme and are filling the massive gap we inherited. It’s practical reforms like these that will keep the lights on and tackle climate change, by giving investors more certainty.” He also said the contracts announced today were part of the government's package of measures that would lead to lower household energy bills. Davey told the Today programme: \"You've got, for example, energy efficiency, product standards, which are all reducing the amounts of energy that people need and therefore cutting their bills. If you see something in isolation, yes, you can say 'well, that's putting up costs a bit' but actually, if you take the whole package, not only are we reducing people's bills overall but we're getting the secure, clean energy that we need to make sure our consumers and our businesses get the energy they need.\" Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at comparison website uSwitch.com, said: “While delivering secure, clean energy is an important part of the government's energy market reforms, it is imperative that affordability and keeping household costs to a minimum remain at the heart of its policy. Although 2% over the next six years may not sound like a significant increase, with the average household energy bill now at an eye-watering £1,265 a year many consumers will be left feeling concerned by this announcement.\" Green groups welcomed the agreements but called on the government to do more on renewable energy and offer greater clarity to the industry. Alasdair Cameron, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \"The government must prioritise cutting energy waste and further increasing renewable power, and abandon its reckless pursuit of fracking – which is dirty, unpopular and will not deliver for years.\" Jimmy Aldridge, energy campaigner at Greenpeace, welcomed the commitment but said: \"If ministers are serious about shaking off our chronic addiction to volatile, dangerous fossil fuels, they should drop their good cop, bad cop routine on clean energy and get on with the job of making Britain's energy cleaner and safer.\" The government also said on Wednesday that more than £30bn had been invested in renewable electricity generation since 2010, creating thousands of jobs. Last week, the third part in a trilogy of reports from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that a switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources would not \"cost the world\" financially."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/09/fukushima-workers-radioactive-leak-water","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-09T09:13:27Z","webTitle":"Six Fukushima workers tested after exposure to radioactive water","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/09/fukushima-workers-radioactive-leak-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/09/fukushima-workers-radioactive-leak-water","fields":{"headline":"Six Fukushima workers tested after exposure to radioactive water","bodyText":"Six workers at the Fukushima nuclear power plant have been exposed to radiation in the latest water leak in a week. The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said several tonnes of radioactive water had spilled from a treatment facility after one of the workers mistakenly removed a pipe. The workers, who were wearing protective clothing and masks, came into contact with the water and were being checked for any external and internal contamination, a Tepco spokesman said. The accident occurred on Wednesday morning as 11 workers were about to remove salt from hundreds of tonnes of water that had already been cleansed of almost all of its radioactive caesium content at another treatment facility. Other radioactive materials still present in the water were measured in August at 37 million becquerels per litre, the utility said, adding that the radiation was in beta form, which is less penetrative than more serious gamma rays. The substances present in the water include strontium-90, which has a half-life of almost 29 years. \"All of the water is kept inside a barrier [to prevent the spread of contamination],\" Tepco said in a press release. The leak lasted almost an hour, during which about 10 tonnes of toxic water is thought to have escaped, but did not reach the nearby Pacific ocean, Tepco said. Tepco is facing mounting criticism of its handling of the Fukushima Daiichi cleanup amid a series of problems blamed on human error and poor management. On Monday, the power supply to pumps that inject coolant water into damaged reactors was accidentally cut, although a backup system kicked in immediately. Last week, Tepco said 430 litres of contaminated water had seeped out of storage tanks and probably ended up in the Pacific. Almost 6,000 workers at Fukushima Daiichi are struggling to contain the huge buildup of toxic water at the site. Earlier this year Tepco belatedly admitted that groundwater flowing down from the hills behind the plant was mixing with radioactive water from the reactor basements and flowing into the sea at the rate of about 300 tonnes a day. Several of the hastily built 1,000 water storage tanks on the site have sprung leaks. One recent leak warranted a level 3 – or serious incident – rating on an international scale of radiological events. • This article was amended on 17 October 2013 to clarify that other radioactive materials still present in the water were measured at 37 million becquerels per litre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/nov/19/canada-tar-sands-oil-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-19T18:22:42Z","webTitle":"Europe 'stigmatising' Canada by labelling tar sands oil highly polluting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/19/canada-tar-sands-oil-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/nov/19/canada-tar-sands-oil-eu","fields":{"headline":"Europe 'stigmatising' Canada by labelling tar sands oil highly polluting","bodyText":"Canada's oil from tar sands would be \"stigmatised\" by EU regulations labelling it as highly polluting, the country's natural resources minister said on Tuesday. Joe Oliver also said a new study ranking Canada last among industrialised countries for climate change action was \"name calling\" and that the country had an environmental record it was \"proud of\". Oliver spoke at a Canada-Europe energy summit in London, UK, which aimed to promote the \"significant commercial opportunities presented by Canada's emergence as an energy superpower\". Canada is lobbying hard against the European Union's intention to designate oil from tar sands as 25% more polluting than conventional oil in new rules aimed at cutting carbon emissions from transport, because of the extra energy needed to extract it. It has previously threatened a trade war over the issue. Oliver said the fuel quality directive (FDQ) was \"unscientific, discriminatory and opaque\" and \"the definition of bad policy\". He cited a new study commissioned by the Canadian government which he claimed reached the same conclusion as him. But the European commission immediately rejected the charges, with the spokesman for climate action commissioner Connie Hedegaard calling the new study \"inadequate\". Oliver said: \"The world will need more and more fossil fuels, to drive growth, raise living standards and lift millions out of poverty. Few countries are as well positioned as Canada to meet this growing demand: Canada has the third-largest proven oil reserves in the world—168bn barrels in the oil sands alone.\" He said controversial oil pipelines, such as Keystone XL, were \"just the beginning of Canada's energy infrastructure build out. Over the coming decade, hundreds of major resource projects, worth over $650bn [£403bn], are slated to come on stream.\" But Oliver added: \"You can have all the oil and gas in the world, but it's not much good if you can't get it to market.\" He said: \"The FQD could stigmatise the oil from Canada and impact on our access to some markets. It would clearly not be helpful. While the growth in demand is not as high [as in Asia], Europe is the biggest single market in the world right now.\" Oliver was supported by the UK energy minister, Michael Fallon, who also spoke at the summit along with BP chief executive Bob Dudley. Fallon said: \"We very much agree with the Canadian government that the emissions data used should accurately reflect the carbon intensity of particular fuel sources.\" In 2011, the Guardian revealed secret support at the highest levels of the UK government for Canada's campaign against the FQD, while British ministers were being lobbied by Shell and BP, which both have major tar sands projects in Alberta. Canada has reneged on its committments to cut its own greenhouse emissions under the Kyoto protocol and appears very unlikely to meet even its watered down target for 2020. At the UN climate change summit in Poland on Monday, a German thinktank placed Canada last in an assessment of national climate action among industrialised countries. Among the world's top 60 polluters, only Iran, Kazahkstan and Saudi Arabia were judged worse. Oliver called the report findings \"curious\" and said such \"name calling is not accurate or constructive\". Challenged on Canada's record on climate change, Oliver said: \"We have a record that we are proud of,\" citing Canada's 77% of low-carbon electricity, from hydroelectric schemes and nuclear power. He said: \"Oil sands, which have become a symbol for some opponents, represents 0.1% of global emissions. We would never go ahead with an energy project unless it was safe for Canadians and the environment.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2014/apr/05/einstein-equation-emc2-special-relativity-alok-jha","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-05T10:06:00Z","webTitle":"E=mc2: Einstein's equation that gave birth to the atom bomb","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/05/einstein-equation-emc2-special-relativity-alok-jha","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2014/apr/05/einstein-equation-emc2-special-relativity-alok-jha","fields":{"headline":"E=mc2: Einstein's equation that gave birth to the atom bomb","bodyText":"This is the most famous equation in the history of equations. It has been printed on countless T-shirts and posters, starred in films and, even if you've never appreciated the beauty or utility of equations, you'll know this one. And you probably also know who came up with it – physicist and Nobel laureate Albert Einstein. The ideas that led to the equation were set down by Einstein in 1905, in a paper submitted to the Annalen der Physik called \"Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?\". The relationship between energy and mass came out of another of Einstein's ideas, special relativity, which was a radical new way to relate the motions of objects in the universe. At one level, the equation is devastatingly simple. It says that the energy (E) in a system (an atom, a person, the solar system) is equal to its total mass (m) multiplied by the square of the speed of light (c, equal to 186,000 miles per second). Like all good equations, though, its simplicity is a rabbit-hole into something profound about nature: energy and mass are not just mathematically related, they are different ways to measure the same thing. Before Einstein, scientists defined energy as the stuff that allows objects and fields to interact or move in some way – kinetic energy is associated with movement, thermal energy involves heating and electromagnetic fields contain energy that is transmitted as waves. All these types of energy can be transformed from one to another, but nothing can ever be created or destroyed. In relativity theory, Einstein introduced mass as a new type of energy to the mix. Beforehand, the mass of something in kilograms was just a measure of how much stuff was present and how resistant it was to being moved around. In Einstein's new world, mass became a way to measure the total energy present in an object, even when it was not being heated, moved or irradiated or whatever else. Mass is just a super-concentrated form of energy and, moreover, these things can turn from one form to the other and back again. Nuclear power stations exploit this idea inside their reactors where subatomic particles, called neutrons, are fired at the nuclei of uranium atoms, which causes the uranium to split into smaller atoms. The process of fission releases energy and further neutrons that can go on to split more uranium atoms. If you made very precise measurements of all the particles before and after the process, you would find that the total mass of the latter was very slightly smaller than the former, a difference known as the \"mass defect\". That missing matter has been converted to energy and you can calculate how much using Einstein's equation. Despite the tiny discrepancy in mass between the uranium atom and its products, the amount of energy released is big and the reason why is obvious when you look at the c² term in the equation – the speed of light is a huge number by itself and its square is therefore enormous. There is a lot of energy condensed into matter — 1kg of \"stuff\" contains around 9 x 10^16 joules, if you could somehow transform all of it into energy. That is the equivalent of more than 40 megatons of TNT. More practically, it is the amount of energy that would come out of a 1 gigawatt power plant, big enough to run 10 million homes for at least three years. A 100kg person, therefore, has enough energy locked up inside them to run that many homes for 300 years. Unlocking that energy is no easy task, however. Nuclear fission is one of several ways to release a tiny bit of an atom's mass, but most of the stuff remains in the form of familiar protons, neutrons and electrons. One way to turn an entire block of material into pure energy would be to bring it together with antimatter. Particles of matter and antimatter are the same, except for an opposite electrical charge. Bring them together, though, and they will annihilate each other into pure energy. Unfortunately, given that we don't know any natural sources of antimatter, the only way to produce it is in particle accelerators and it would take 10 million years to produce a kilogram of it. Particle accelerators studying fundamental physics are another place where Einstein's equation becomes useful. Special relativity says that the faster something moves, the more massive it becomes. In a particle accelerator, protons are accelerated to almost the speed of light and smashed into each other. The high energy of these collisions allows the formation of new, more massive particles than protons – such as the Higgs boson – that physicists might want to study. Which particles might be formed and how much mass they have can all be calculated using Einstein's equation. It would be nice to think that Einstein's equation became famous simply because of its fundamental importance in making us understand how different the world really is to how we perceived it a century ago. But its fame is mostly because of its association with one of the most devastating weapons produced by humans – the atomic bomb. The equation appeared in the report, prepared for the US government by physicist Henry DeWolf Smyth in 1945, on the Allied efforts to make an atomic bomb during the Manhattan project. The result of that project led to the death of hundreds of thousands of Japanese citizens in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Einstein himself had encouraged the US government to fund research into atomic energy during the second world war but his own involvement in the Manhattan project was limited because of his lack of security clearances. It is unlikely that Einstein's equation was much use in designing the bomb, beyond making scientists and military leaders realise that such a thing would be theoretically possible, but the association has stuck.

Adding insult to the social injury of dislocation, hardship and the mounting \"atomic divorces\" of families on the edge, the public is being forced to pay for the clean up – a clear failure of the law to hold the nuclear industry liable for its disasters. In the US, a New Orleans court has the task of ruling whether BP, or its partners Transocean and Halliburton, were negligent in their work on the Macondo oil well, and how much money each company may have to pay for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. BP, which has said its partners shared responsibility for the rig safety, faces fines of more than US$17.5bn if found guilty. That's on top of compensation to claimants not part of an estimated $8.5bn settlement the company already reached last year. But two years after the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan, victims are still awaiting full compensation from an industry that enjoys government protection. Hundreds of thousands of victims, who fled their homes to escape the release of radiation from the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant still live in limbo, unable to return home or rebuild their lives elsewhere. It is heart wrenching to witness the social toll of this avoidable industrial accident, doubly when you see public compensation being subordinated to private profit. This is the reality of the Fukushima disaster, the result of a protection system that allows nuclear operators to pay only a tiny fraction of the costs of an accident, forcing the public to pay the rest. Governments set up this protection 60 years ago to help get the nuclear power industry off the ground. Despite the unfairness of the system, governments have done nothing to rectify it. The Fukushima disaster highlights the need for change. In law, Fukushima plant operator Tepco should pay the full costs of the accident. But there is a loophole: Tepco can't pay. So the government stepped in and nationalised the company, meaning Japanese taxpayers will pay for this disaster. What's worse, is that this protection system works even better for the companies that supply reactors and other equipment to nuclear operators: they don't pay any of the costs of a disaster. Big energy giants, such as General Electric, Toshiba and Hitachi, pay nothing if one of their reactors causes a disaster. At Fukushima, all three built reactors based on GE's flawed Mark I reactor design. Concerns that the reactor containment would fail during a major accident proved correct – this is exactly what happened. The flaw was revealed decades earlier, but the problem wasn't fixed. But the protection system means that GE, Hitachi and Toshiba and other big companies with enormous wealth are not held liable when their equipment contributes to a disaster. Greenpeace is calling for the creation of a real nuclear liability system, one that makes both nuclear operators and their suppliers pay all the costs of their failures, not taxpayers. If reactor suppliers knew they would be held liable in a disaster they would place more attention on the risks. They might even keep their flawed and unsafe products off the market. India has a law that makes suppliers liable. And it frightens GE. John Flannery, chief executive, said on the 21st February that GE won't pursue the reactor business in India if the law isn't changed. \"We are a private enterprise and we just can't take that kind of risk profiles,\" he said. Last December, a senior US State Department official also said nuclear companies will \"find it difficult\" to take part in India's nuclear industry when they are exposed \"to the risk of significant financial penalty.\" Essentially, they are advocating for continued protection. And the costs of the Fukushima disaster make it crystal clear why nuclear operators and their reactor suppliers demand protection. The full cost of the Fukushima disaster is estimated at US$250bn. In a disaster, the protection system in most nuclear countries only requires a nuclear operator to pay a paltry $470m to $2bn and suppliers to pay nothing. Taxpayers pay the difference. Of course, GE, Hitachi, Toshiba and other nuclear parts suppliers want to maintain the current system. Companies that supply reactors don't like financial risks, even if they don't design safe reactors. But hundreds of millions of people live near the world's 436 reactors and a disaster at any one of these reactors could be catastrophic. People would suffer and taxpayers would pay almost all of the costs. Absurdly, the powerful nuclear industry has greater protection and rights than the public – the ones at risk of radiation in a disaster. It's high time for that liability to be given back to the industry. Kumi Naidoo is executive director at Greenpeace International This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Monitoring by the site's operator, Sellafield Limited, has found traces of radioactivity in the birds' droppings. This is thought to come from the insects they have consumed around the storage ponds for radioactive waste . Investigations have been launched by the agency, the government's Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and Sellafield, while measures are being taken to try and prevent the contamination from recurring. According to Sellafield, the levels of radioactivity discovered were very low and there was \"no threat\" to public health. \"There is no direct pathway for exposure to members of the public,\" said a Sellafield spokesman. \"Measures are in place to reduce the possibility of birds gaining access to facilities.\" Nutrients and nesting materials are being removed to try and make the site less attractive for birds' breeding. \"Possible problems are reduced by applying the principle of good housekeeping and the incorporation of bird exclusion measures,\" the spokesman added. Up to 30 swallows had been surveyed. \"There was insufficient radioactivity in the guano to require personal protection beyond that required for hygiene purposes,\" he said. Though it was difficult to be sure, contaminated mosquitoes were \"a possible pathway\". Anti-nuclear groups pointed out that swallows fly long distances. \"These much-loved and now radioactive birds and their offspring will unwittingly be carrying a toxic message from Sellafield when they migrate back to southern Africa at the end of the summer,\" said Martin Forwood from Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment. \"Given the history of bird contamination at Sellafield, it is quite extraordinary that it's been allowed to happen again. They have failed to deal with this problem for years, and should have covered up their waste ponds long ago.\" More than 150 pigeons were found to be contaminated with Sellafield's radioactivity in 1998, and contaminated gulls were culled in 2010. There have also been problems with radioactive fruit flies and gnats at the Hanford nuclear plant in Washington State, US. There are at least two open-air ponds at Sellafield, both dating back to the 1950s. They store radioactive waste from early nuclear reactors and may generate warmth that attracts insects. Sellafield realised that birds could become contaminated with low levels of radioactivity as a result of historic operations at the plant. \"Cleaning up the legacy buildings on the site will remove the source of contamination and remains a priority activity,\" said the site spokesman. The contamination was reported to a sub-committee of the West Cumbria Sites Stakeholder Group last week by the Environment Agency. In an email yesterday to Forwood, Michael Ainsworth, one of the agency's nuclear regulators, confirmed that the \"contamination of nesting sites\" had been identified by Sellafield. The agency was now awaiting a report from the site, he said. \"They are in the process of carrying out an investigation into this issue and looking at ways of excluding birds from their nesting sites and breaking the life cycle of the mosquitoes – their food source.\" An ONR spokesman said: \"Sellafield Limited is aware of the potential spread of radioactive material from the site by wildlife and, with the assistance of specialist wildlife control contractors, it has been taking steps over a number of years to address this matter.\" He added: \"Sellafield Limited's ongoing review indicates that the amount of radioactive material that may be distributed in this manner is unlikely to pose a threat to public health. We are keeping the situation under review and the matter will be followed up during our ongoing interactions with Sellafield Limited.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"big-energy-debate/five-reasons-energy-bills-high","type":"article","sectionId":"big-energy-debate","sectionName":"The big energy debate","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-14T07:30:00Z","webTitle":"Five reasons why energy bills are so high – and still rising","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/big-energy-debate/five-reasons-energy-bills-high","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/big-energy-debate/five-reasons-energy-bills-high","fields":{"headline":"Five reasons why energy bills are so high – and still rising","bodyText":"We're spending more and more on energy with no end in sight, regardless of what shade of green we plan for our future. Can we do anything about it? Gas prices are not easy to control, but politicians do set energy taxes and levies, and decide on how investment in low-carbon power generation, the power grid and energy efficiency is spent. Understanding what makes up our energy bills is key to holding politicians and energy providers to account. Here are the five reasons your gas bills are high and rising. 1. High gas prices \"In the last 10 years, commodity prices are probably the single biggest thing that has affected energy bills in the UK,\" says energy consultant Matt Brown. Most of the money households fork out for energy is spent on gas for heating, some 60%. But in the UK's gas-driven power sector, the gas price has also become the main driver of the electricity price. Energy bills have gone up as the UK shifted from being a net exporter to a net importer of gas in the last decade, and gas prices rose in tandem with oil prices. The two fuels are typically drilled for together and their prices remain closely linked, despite Brussels' efforts to create more of an open market for gas. 2. Green levies and other taxes That said, the relative importance of gas prices is going down. The most recent increases in electricity bills across Europe are primarily due to higher taxes and levies, including support for renewable energy, according to research from the European Commission. Calculating just how strong a price driver this is, however, is difficult. European electricity industry association Eurelectric is working on a yet-to-be published study whose first findings show that the energy part of UK household electricity bills went down by 4% from 2008-12, not up by 6% as the commission calculates. Instead, Eurelectric attributes much more of the total increase in bills to taxes and levies. Suddenly the \"big six\" energy firms no longer look like the biggest problem; it could be government. In truth the figures differ because countries do their accounting differently. The UK counts renewables subsidies towards a bill's energy component while Spain, for example, adds it to grid costs. Note that, even with Eurelectric's revised numbers, taxes and levies make up just 15% of a UK household electricity bill compared to nearly half in Germany. This is also due to the UK's low VAT rate on energy – 5% compared to 20% across most of Europe. Despite the controversy, UK households pay below average bills in Europe. And the finger is still pointing in the other direction: Ofgem has called for a full-scale competition enquiry into the energy sector because energy retailers increased their profits nearly fivefold from 2009-12 with \"no clear evidence\" of them becoming more cost-efficient. Are we paying them too much for our energy? 3. Investment in the grid Bills need to cover repairs, replacements and upgrades to the grid as well as low-carbon generation. Ofgem interim partner Martin Crouch does not see this as a cause of rising bills and expects network costs will be \"staying flat in real terms\". Yet further investment is needed to link up offshore wind farms and better connect the UK to the European mainland. The latter would foster competition, bolster security of supply and enable imports of cheaper power from the likes of Germany, which has a surplus of renewables and a coal-driven power market. \"The UK would profit from the EU internal electricity market if it had enough interconnections,\" says Katharina Grave, a consultant with Ecofys. Importing green power from elsewhere could well be cheaper than subsidising expensive new domestic projects such as the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant too. Once built, it is due to get more subsidies than German photovoltaic (PV) solar projects do today. Grid-related costs make up about a fifth of the average UK household electricity bill today. Although Crouch and others expect this to hold steady because costs are spread over decades, further expenses may trickle down to consumers through energy producers who will pay for the bulk of offshore and international connections. Most grid costs relate to hardware, such as building new cables to carry electricity, but part of it includes the cost of technology including smart meters, which will enhance efficiency and curb the rise of total costs. 4. Our outdated energy market Smart meters bring with them an opportunity to consume at times of day when electricity is cheaper (\"demand response\") and to produce our own electricity. Welcome to the era of the empowered consumer. For the first time, customers will be able to select their energy provider on criteria beyond price per kilowatt hour and how green they claim to be. Technological change gives households the opportunity to demand a whole new kind of energy package. Yet consumers are held back by the way the electricity market currently operates. \"How markets are structured is not keeping up with reality and this is artificially and totally unnecessarily driving up prices,\" says Jessica Strömbäck, executive director of the Smart Energy Demand Coalition. The UK's plans for a market which will reward energy producers for their capacity to produce rather than what they actually provide risks shutting consumers out and simply providing a \"£6bn subsidy for the big six\", she says. And yet the UK has gone farther than any other European country in making \"demand response\" possible. Some say it needs a higher electricity price to achieve more. 5. Failure to be energy efficient Households are spending more on energy even though they are consuming less. Energy efficiency improvements are inadequate to offset rising prices. Yet the perceived costs of doing energy efficiency threaten the future of the UK's energy efficiency programme overall. \"The one thing that will benefit consumers will be savagely cut,\" says Eoin Lees, founder of the UK's Energy Saving Trust. \"Energy efficiency is by far the most effective way to cut energy bills,\" argues Ed Matthew, founder of Transform UK, which is running an energy bills campaign. \"Renovating buildings needs to become one of the UK's priority infrastructure investments.\" Sonja van Renssen is a Brussels-based writer for Energy Post This article is part of the Guardian's #bigenergydebate series.

Its shares fell 19.6p or 5% to 353.1p amid growing talk the government would split it into a good and bad bank, with many in the City believing this could be to the detriment of minority shareholders. On top of that, the banking sector came under pressure after JP Morgan reportedly made a tentative $13bn settlement relating to bad mortgage loans sold before the 2008 crisis. Others may have to follow suit. Nomura said: We think it is becoming more likely that the good bank/bad bank review will result in significant change for RBS. A decision is said to be imminent in the next few weeks and several options are being considered: 1) setting up a bad bank inside RBS to be run by an independent team; 2) setting up a bad bank inside RBS, in a model similar to that of UBS, which had more support from the central bank; 3) the final option would be the taxpayer-backed bad bank for the assets, similar to the solution from the Swedish government in the 1990s. We continue to believe that minority shareholders have much to lose from an unfavourable outcome of the review with the government maintaining considerable leverage over the minorities. On the US mortgage securities, Nomura said there was a material risk for RBS: RBS was involved in the sale of around $32bn of the MBS securities under scrutiny (similar to JP Morgan's $33bn). The largest Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) suit is in Connecticut courts rather than New York, where more of the harsher settlements have been imposed and losses on RBS portfolios experienced by the FHFA have been said to be lower. However, due to the legal uncertainties and the large settlements discussed by the press, we see this as a material tail risk to the group. Potential capital release from [the sale of US subsidiary] Citizens helps in this context to plug any holes, though we don't see it as a means to buy back shares. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 31.62 points higher at 6654.20, ahead of Tuesday's US non-farm payroll numbers, delayed because of the US government shutdown. With uncertainty over the effect of the closure on the country's economy, most observers believe the US Federal Reserve will be reluctant to begin easing its $85bn a month bond buying programme in the immediate future. David Jones, chief market strategist at IG, said: It has been yet another positive day for the FTSE 100, which is not too surprising given the strong finish by the S&amp;P 500 in the US on Friday, after it closed at another all-time high. There was some caution among traders ahead of Tuesday's US unemployment numbers. Sentiment being what is at the moment, any stock market weakness following the release is likely to be seen as a buying opportunity. A good jobs number means the economy is fine; a bad number means the US Federal Reserve is likely to further delay withdrawing support. The net result is that so far shares have seldom stayed down for long as a result of the US unemployment levels. This was the eighth successive daily rise for the FTSE 100, the best performance since a 10 day winning streak in May. Among the risers, G4S added 8.5p to 250.5p after weekend reports that private equity group Charterhouse Capital could be interested in buying the outsourcing company's cash solutions business for £1bn have sent its shares soaring 4%, up 9.7p to 251.7p. The division transports cash in its high tech security vehicles and manages ATMs. BAE Systems closed 9p higher at 453.9p and Rolls-Royce rose 31p to £11.23 after positive comments from Citigroup. Citi analysts kept their neutral rating on BAE but raised their target price from 350p to 460p along with their 2014 and 2015 forecasts. On Rolls, Citi raised its target price from 1200p to 1280p. But Marks &amp; Spencer lost 8p to 487.1p following news of another top level departure as the retailer struggles to improve its general merchandise sales. Gillian Ridley Whittle, development and buying director for womenswear, told M&amp;S she plans to leave to join Australian department store group Target. Royal Mail initially continued its relentless rise, with weekend reports suggesting a number of investment banks had valued it at around £5bn rather than the flotation price of £3.3bn. But after hitting 538.5p, the shares fell back to close 4.5p lower at 498p on profit taking. Meanwhile, among the mid-caps, defence group Qinetiq jumped 8.9p to 202.8p following talk it had put its US business up for sale, which could leave the rest of the company vulnerable to a bid. IT group Aveva added 15p to £25.95 on hopes it would benefit from the news of the go-ahead for a new nuclear power plant. EDF has signed a deal with the UK government to build two reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset, and analyst George O'Connor at Panmure Gordon said: EDF and the UK government's announcement that they have reached an agreement for an investment contract of the planned Hinkley Point C nuclear power station will lead to a revenue uptick for Aveva. On 7 November Aveva announced that EDF has expanded its investment in Aveva technology by implementing additional engineering software products from the Aveva Plant portfolio. EDF began working with Aveva in the 1980s. Provident Financial put on 62p to £16.38 after Shore Capital raised its recommendation from hold to buy. SuperGroup added 40p to £11.09 after Wayne Brown at Canaccord repeated his £15 target for the retailer's shares. He said: Shares have been weak the past month under performing the FTSE 350 Retailers by around 10%. We feel this is overdone and offers a strong buying opportunity ahead of the group's second quarter trading update due on 7 November. Firstly the group is materially out-performing its broad fashion and apparel peer group on a like for like sales growth and wholesale order book basis. Despite this current run-rate of premium growth, 2013/14 is a year of investment and the group should see the benefits from its new distribution centre, enhanced design functions and improved online/omni-channel, next year. We expect the next trading update to be positive and highlight a continuation from the first quarter with wholesale order book growth of 26% and like for like sales up 8.5%. We feel this provides confidence for more than 20% in wholesale growth in the first half of 2013/14 and sustainable like for like sales growth of mid-single digits. The recent interims from Ted Baker, should also point to market share gains from well invested strong brands. Finally Karelian Diamond Resources closed nearly 14% higher at 1.025p after a positive exploration update from its Finnish sites. Chairman Richard Conroy said: Finland has the potential to host diamond deposits comparable to the world class diamond deposits found in similar geology across the border in Russia, and by utilising [data from] Rio Tinto...alongside our own, we are seeing encouraging signs that that potential may be realised. Meanwhile in a note on the sector, Citigroup said: Diamond prices are weaker than they were two years ago and demand is not yet strong enough for the limited mine supply to create a significant shortage. It is therefore likely that prices will stabilize at recent lower levels through 2013 and 2014, but that the mine supply trend, the structural demand shift in China, and a slowly recovering global economy should see diamond shortages making their mark on prices in 2015-2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/mar/26/will-shale-gas-make-europe-less-dependent-on-russian-gas","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-26T17:42:48Z","webTitle":"Will fracking make Europe less dependent on Russian gas?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/26/will-shale-gas-make-europe-less-dependent-on-russian-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/mar/26/will-shale-gas-make-europe-less-dependent-on-russian-gas","fields":{"headline":"Will fracking make Europe less dependent on Russian gas?","bodyText":"Prime minister David Cameron's faith in shale gas seems to be misplaced. While fracking may play a part in Europe's long term future, it will not be in large enough quantities to offset dependence on Russian gas. The message from Cameron is partly disingenuous. By saying fracking is imminent and there could be wells operating this year, he implies that shale gas could soon be contributing to EU energy. This makes it relevent to the game currently being played between Russia and the EU. This achieves the rhetorical aim of shoehorning fracking into the dominant story of the moment - the Ukraine crisis. In fact, fracking is entirely irrelevent to the short and medium term energy strategies of the EU. Commercially viable fracking in Europe is only a few years closer than fusion power and contains almost as many uncertainties. The conditions that created the US shale gas boom were unique and, as Antony Froggatt of Chatham House says, \"extremely unlikely to be repeated in other parts of the world\". Analysis of the potential for shale in Europe points to significantly higher production prices for Europe's fracking industry. Under current global gas price conditions, even comparitively cheap indigenous shale gas would have to outcompete Qatari gas before it ate into Russia's supply. But that does not mean Cameron is wrong. He argues that the long game needs to be considered and weaning Europe off Russian gas is strategically important. If we accept prima facie that buying gas from Russia is bad. Then Europe's huge shale reserve is one option for building resiliance and independence into the energy supply. But according to academics it is simply not a very good one. Most think it might make up a small part of European energy in 20 years time. But it is unlikely to be the panacea Cameron seems to think. Although Harald Heubaum from Univeristy of London did say that you can never be certain with energy markets - very few people predicted the shale boom in the US. Even so, why, at this moment in time, is Cameron so keen to talk primarily about shale gas and not about energy efficiency and renewable energy? Researchers say these measures are the most cost-effective and realistic ways to reduce the EU's gas imports. His timing and omission of other options reveals his agenda. The prime minister's statement that the UK would have wells up and running by the end of the year may not have been as fanciful as I first thought. He was referring, I am told, to the test stage for the wells, which may happen in a few instances this year. But what he didn't say was that it would be at least two years and likely three before full scale production was happening at any site. My colleague Stephen Burgen has filed a story from Barcelona on the growing push for shale exploration in cash-strapped Spain. No rhetoric about Russian omnipotence from Spain's officials though, just a straight up appeal to economic interest. Several regional governments have outlawed fracking but last year the central government used its overall majority to pass legislation that overrules regional administrations on the issue. \"The minister has to defend the interest of Spain as a whole, and the regional presidents have every right to defend their interests,\" said Enrique Hernández Bento, who is minister for both energy and tourism. \"The government will support these explorations as long as they comply with legal and environmental requirements.\" The organisation Shale Gas España says: \"This won't be a panacea that makes Spain self-sufficient.\" But, it says, fracking will allow Spain to be 60% rather than 80% dependent on conventional gas. However a report from E3G called into question the economic rationale behind fracking in the EU saying production costs would be 150%-250% more expensive than US shale gas. According to Decc figures, the UK imports 55% of its gas from Norway, 27% from Qatar, 14.5% from the Netherlands and 3% from Belgium. But Gazprom and others in the gas industry have said that supply from the Netherlands and Belgium may come, in part, from Russia. Commenter Donough Shanahan says below: Russia whatever way you swing it, is supplying very little of the UK's gas (though it is increasing). Gas from MLE mainly comes from the Dutch Groningen field. So the comments above from Gasprom are not valid and are simply saber rattling. However as the situation potential gets worse, it may start to become reality. Harald Heubaum from the University of London said Russia had never cut off energy supply to the EU and that the security risk to Europe may be being overstated. \"It hasn't used [gas] as a weapon against EU countries. Cutting Russian supplies to the Ukraine [in 2006 and 2009] was because of disputes over the gas price paid by the Ukraine, not because of conflict with markets in the EU. There was then an undesirable knock-on effect but it wasn't aimed at Europe at the time. Take out the issues with Ukraine as a transit country and Russia has been a reliable supplier for all these years. It has honoured its contractual obligations. Of course, the situation may well change if European countries decide to widen their sanctions, including on the energy sector.\" Russian gas producer Gazprom said their business with the EU was founded on years of goodwill and security. \"Our cooperation with European partners rests on decades-long contracts which ensures unprecedented stability for our customers. This model has stood the test of time proving its efficiency for all parties involved.\" Michael Klare, professor of peace and world security studies at Hampshire College, told Carbon Brief this month: \"A lot of elites in Ukraine and Russia benefited from the cozy ties between Gazprom and Ukrainian gas companies and are reluctant to see an EU-imposed order that would threaten their wealth and privileges.\" The EU has been steadily reducing its Russian reliance, in 2002 the Union drew 40% of its gas from Russia, whereas that has now dropped to around a quarter. On the other hand the EU gas market makes up 60% of Russian company Gazprom's exports and 50% of their income. To put that in context, 20% of the entire Russian Federation budget comes from revenues from Gazprom. Making EU gas supply a seriously important piece on the Russian chessboard, one they would surely be loath to do away with. Academics say David Cameron is pushing a short term agenda by focussing on security and that the shale gas success in the United States was predicated on a series of conditions that were \"extremely unlikely\" to be repeated in Europe. Antony Froggatt senior research fellow at Chatham House says energy policy was often viewed as a trilemma with three competing priorities - security, affordability and sustainability. \"An event pushes one of them up the political agenda and that becomes the policy priority,\" he says. This means short-termism can create imbalance the overall approach. For example the way in which events in Ukraine have made security the primary energy issue with no mention from Cameron of climate change or the politician's darling, electricity prices. But he says that shale gas is not going to be a short term fix becuase it was not expected to come online at a competitive price for a decade. \"If we want a hedge against Russian gas in the next 10 years, it's not shale gas.\" Rather, he said, energy efficiency was vastly preferable, although it was proving difficult to convince countries to act upon. Froggatt says the potential for shale gas to price Russian gas out of the market relies on prices staying at the same relative levels for the decade or more it will take for fracking to begin in earnest. Also, Europe could not rely on shale gas being as cheap as it was in the US. \"There's lots of conditions in the Unites States in terms of why shale gas is relatively cheap at the current time. It relates to interest rates, land use, technological experience, economies of scale, geology. You can't assume that the same conditions will apply in Europe. It is a series of quite advantageous conditions that appear in the United States for shale gas that would be extremely unlikely to be repeated in other parts of the world.\" Harald Heubaum from the University of London said the idea that shale gas prices could be as low as the US was \"fanciful thinking\" and that Cameron's suggestion fracking could play a role in the current stand-off with Russia was \"hogwash\". Heubaum said shale gas was worth considering in the longer term, but it would probably only ever play a minor role in Europe's energy mix (\"a couple of percentage points, maybe a bit more\"), rather than being the panancea to energy dependence. \"It's not unreasonable to be thinking about shale gas as playing a part in that mix, but it is unlikely because of the resistance from the environment community,\" he said, adding that the E3G report cited earlier was pretty much \"spot on\". Froggatt says: \"Shale gas is a potential option that has uncertainites associated with it and some potential advantages, which we've seen in the United States. But there are other options. I wouldn't say it is an absolutely necessary technology because there are a series of other options that exist.\" He said renewable technology was preferable to shale gas in its potential to contribute to Europe's energy supply. E3G have produced a document debunking a few shale gas \"myths\". They say it is true that Europe has significant shale gas reserves. But they argue that these supplies should be left in the ground for four reasons. Shale gas is not cheap - \"Shale gas has been produced and sold cheaply (at times at prices below the cost of production) in the USA. But the US shale gas revolution took 20-30 years to happen. Many of the conditions that have enabled the low cost of US shale gas production... do not exist in the EU and, as a result, EU production costs are expected to be 150%-250% higher per unit of gas extracted.\" Shale gas will not reduce EU energy prices - \"Cambridge Econometrics has estimated that to achieve shale gas production levels at a scale to impact on EU gas prices 33,500-67,000 wells would need to be drilled in the EU by 2050. Currently fewer than 100 such wells have been drilled. In addition, there are concerns about the supply chain. It is estimated that as production ramps up, 148-295 rigs a year would be required in 2035. Currently the EU has a rig manufacturing capability of 12-18 per year.\" Shale gas will not improve our security of supply - \"21 of the EU 28 Member States import gas from Russia. Even under the most optimistic scenarios, shale gas is projected to meet just 10% of European gas demand by 2030. Most commentators agree that 2-3% by 2030 is a more realistic estimate. Therefore, even in the best case scenario, the volumes of EU shale gas production achieved will be too small to meaningfully impact on EU security of supply concerns.\" Shale gas cannot help us address climate change - \"There are concerns that methane leakages from shale gas extraction may cancel out any CO2 reductions achieved and, even if technology can be developed to contain such leakages, production is not expected to come on stream fast enough or in sufficient quantities to displace coal in the EU power generation mix.\" European leaders met last week to discuss the issue of energy security. EU council president Herman van Rompuy said that by 2035 Europe could be importing 80% of its oil and gas. According to Euractiv, van Rompuy said: “Today we sent a clear signal that Europe is stepping up a gear to reduce energy dependency, especially with Russia”, Van Rompuy said. He added that the goal would be pursued by reducing energy demands, through introducing more energy efficiency, by diversifying the EU’s supply routes and expanding energy sources, particularly renewables. He said shale gas imports from the US could be used to replace Russian gas. While Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor \"also didn’t discard developing shale gas in Europe as an alternative to imports. But she put more emphasis on trying to cut down energy consumption by measures of energy efficiency, and a bigger recourse to renewable energy\". Ken Cronin, chief executive UKOOG, the UK's onshore oil and gas industry body, said: \"The PM is right in that shale gas can put the UK in charge of our own destiny. In addition to the gas needed to heat our homes, keep the lights on and power our businesses, it is nearly impossible to get through a day without using multiple products that contain oil or gas. Shampoo, toothpaste, shaving foam, lipstick, and clothing all contain petroleum products and natural gas is also the raw material for plastics. Many industries use gas not only as an energy source but also as a key component of their manufacturing processes. \"Our gas is increasingly being imported from other countries – currently over half comes from overseas and by 2030 that will have risen to 70%. Imports generate very little UK tax revenues and gas producers such as Russia, Algeria or Qatar will sell to the highest bidder. Increasing import dependency puts us at the mercy of not only volatile global energy markets, but both physical and political energy security issues. \"It is therefore vital that we find a home-grown solution that protects both our economy and our environment. \"With renewable energy making technological advances but not yet ready in volume and cost effectiveness, domestic shale gas can provide a medium term solution that can cut carbon emissions. Today we continue to burn a lot of coal, but replacing it with gas would reduce carbon emissions by half, there are also significant positive reductions when imports are taken into consideration.\" The prime minister threw the shale gas industry a bit of a curve ball yesterday by saying: \"By the end of this year, there should be some unconventional gas wells up and running that we can demonstrate, and I think the enthusiasm for it will grow.\" Which is simply not the case. The most advanced shale gas well, at Barton Moss, is due to begin test drilling in two months, protests allowing. Once this is complete, an application needs to be made for a test fracking license. If this is granted, testing will go on for another year before the well can apply for a full fracking license. Meaning full extraction won't start until at least 2016 and more likely 2017. And that is just one well. Meaningfull shale gas production will not begin in the UK until the end of the decade. As a caveat to the PM's statement, extraction of coalbed methane (also an \"unconventional gas\") may begin in Scotland next year, but more likely 2016. Still nowhere near this year. Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research said in Al Jazeera America on Monday that the numbers don't add up for shale gas. If the goal is to reduce demand for Russian natural gas, the most cost-effective way is to do much more of what Germany and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the EU is already doing: promote conservation and mass transit and further subsidize the cost of installing solar and wind energy. Greenpeace UK energy campaigner Lawrence Carter echoed his boss John Sauven's comments in the Guardian yesterday, saying: “Will fracking reduce our dependence on Russian gas? The simple answer is no, and it’s the industry itself that says so. A study for the oil and gas industry by consultants Pöyry, found that European supplies wouldn't even come on stream at scale for at least a decade. The study also shows that while the EU's dependency on gas imports could be reduced by up to 18% depending on the success of EU shale gas extraction, it is actually supplies of liquefied natural gas from Qatar that would be displaced by shale gas - supplies that are deemed \"secure\" by energy minister Michael Fallon. Even a shale gas boom will have no impact on Russian imports until after 2030, by which point demand for gas should be falling sharply in the EU as efforts to limit climate change bear fruit. “The same ministers now railing against Europe’s dependence on Russian gas are the same who, for years, were happy for Britain to be lining the pockets of unsavoury oligarchs in places like Russian and Qatar, instead of moving the country towards clean, home-grown energy. After losing the argument on lower energy bills and job creation, David Cameron and his government are clearly exploiting the Ukraine crisis in the hope of turning fracking into a national security issue to drown out any criticism.” Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Tony Bosworth said: “Speeding up fracking is the wrong response to the Ukraine crisis. Shale gas won't deliver until the 2020s at the earliest; is very unlikely to cut energy bills; and it's another climate-changing fossil fuel. “If the Prime Minister wants to speed up energy solutions he should get on with cutting energy waste from our heat-leaking homes and developing the UK’s vast renewable energy potential from the wind, sun and sea.\" Renewable Energy Association chief executive Nina Skorupska said \"renewable energy does not just reduce our carbon emissions, it also reduces our exposure to energy market shocks caused by geopolitical events\". Sweden gets 51% of its overall energy from renewables, so international market shocks will have much less of an impact on their energy prices. Renewable energy gives energy security by definition – it doesn’t run out and the resources are within our control. Several technologies don’t even require fuel inputs (solar, wind, hydro, marine, geothermal, etc.) and those that do (biomass and biofuel feedstocks), we can buy it from trusted trade partners such as the USA and our EU neighbours. Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity said: “Ed Davey yesterday said offshore wind was the answer to Russian gas dependency, while today the industry suffers a colossal blow from SSE - due to government policy uncertainty. SSE just announced it is pulling out of four projects totalling over 11,000MW - that's a quarter of Britain's entire Offshore wind target! And Cameron has recently been boasting about the nuclear power station the Russians will build for us, that one made me laugh - now that sanctions are all the rage. The nuke station would provide 5 to 6% of UKs electricity - more than the % of Russian gas we use now apparently.” In the US, the shale industry has been agitating for new access to EU markets. They have identified Europe's dependence on Russian gas as an opportuinity to expland their market. According to Reuters, German chancellor Angela Merkel last week said she supported asking US president Barack Obama to relax restrictions on exports of U.S. gas. One mechanism for this would be the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which would be the world's largest free trade deal. But Sean Cockerham and Kevin G. Hall on Mcclatchy DC said that shale gas from America would run up against the same issues as shale gas from Europe. Namely the infrastructure was years away and it would likely only replace Europe's Asian gas supply. But while calls for such a Berlin-airlift-style approach to rush American natural gas to Europe and liberate it from the Russians makes for a good political sound bite, such a move isn’t practical and vastly oversimplifies the issue. It would take years to build the necessary facilities on both sides of the Atlantic for shipping and receiving the liquefied natural gas. The countries most reliant on Russian energy, including Ukraine, have no terminals for receiving LNG tankers. They get their natural gas from pipelines. “The potential in the short term is nothing,” said Edward Chow, an energy and security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. There are also the realities of the free market. The U.S. Department of Energy has so far approved six applications for natural gas export terminals, but most of that gas is destined for Asia, where prices are far higher and companies can make more money than selling it in Europe. Longer term, it’s not clear how price-competitive U.S. liquefied natural gas would be in Europe after the cost of transport is factored in, said Tim Boersma, an energy expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. The American natural gas in Europe would have to compete against supplies from places such as Russia, Norway, Algeria, even the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth US said the US shale gas push was purely opportunistic. \"The fossil fuel industry and its shills are willing to exploit any crisis and go to any lengths in their effort to extract more dirty fuels and dismantle critical climate policies. Rather than promoting dirty fossil fuels like tar sands and fracked natural gas, Obama and [EC president José Manuel] Barroso should be doing everything they can to keep these fuels in the ground and help avert climate catastrophe.\" Thanks to commenter SteB1, who pointed out Terry Macalister's report earlier this month on government plans to build a nuclear power plant in the UK with a state-owned Russian company. Macalister says \"the dependence side of the argument against Russia is very limited\". \"Clearly there is something jarring about the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) boasting about its positive negotiations with the Russians over building a nuclear power station in Britain just as a summit is due to begin in London about what sanctions can be taken against Moscow over its involvement in the Crimea. \"If Vladimir Putin is threatening to once again use energy as a political weapon in the Ukraine by cutting off the country's gas exports, then this is a bad moment to talk about state-owned Rosatom taking a critical stake in UK power infrastructure through the construction of an atomic plant. \"... only around 1%-2% of Britain's gas imports currently come from Siberia, while one Russian nuclear power plant would provide perhaps 5% or 6% of the country's electricity needs.\" Yesterday, energy secretary Ed Davey was pushing the renewables handcart, using Russia and the Crimea as added justification for the growth of offshore wind farms, my colleague Terry Macalister reported. \"[Windfarms] are not just the local providers of green energy we need for our low-carbon future, but play an important role at a time of international uncertainty that we see with now Russia and Crimea,\" he explained. The government's use of the Ukraine situation in both cases is an effective wedge on green groups, who will find it difficult to say that energy independence is not important in the case of shale gas, but vital in terms of renewables. The answer is: quite. Around 30% of Europe's gas comes from Russia and natural gas makes up 18.8% of the continent's primary energy supply. But a report by consulting firm Pöyry for Europe's oil and gas industry shows the reliance on Russian gas will increase to 50% by 2050 regardless of whether shale gas is part of the mix or not. John Williams, who co-authored the report, said: \"There's nothing in that level of shale gas production that will reduce the dependence on Russia from where we are now. In fact it would still be increasing over time. What you'd need to do, instead of looking at increases of shale gas prodcution you would need to start trying to introduce more energy efficency measures.\" But he said it was difficult to see how renewable energy measures could pick up much more of the supply burden without raising costs for consumers. The study controlled the renewable deployment so that it remained at current levels. The study also found that even in a 'shale boom scenario' shale gas would supply less gas to Europe than Russia in 2050. Williams said it would not be clear how the EU planned on reducing dependence on Russia until a report is released by the EU commission in June. \"There are a lot of issues at play, it's not just as simple as saying 'we don't want Russian gas and we can replace it'.\" He said that shale gas may well replace other, more expensive gas before it replaced cheap Russian supplies. David Cameron is just one in a long line of Tories who have been pushing fracking in the wake of Russia's annexation of the Crimea. ConservativeHome commentator Garvan Walshe wrote earlier this month that one of Cameron's top ten responses to the crisis should be to \"Get Fracking\". With no mention of energy independence, Walshe said the government should: Speed up the process for shale oil and gas drilling, and head off opposition by diverting a sizeable proportion of royalties from fracking to the communities and individuals in which wells are drilled. Then in the past week, in what must have been an orchestrated move, energy minister Michael Fallon and foreign minister William Hague hit the pages of the Telegraph pushing shale gas. Softening the ground for Cameron to say yesterday: \"Completing the energy single market, making sure there are better interconnectors, making sure there are two-way flows of gas, better storage. This is really good work that's going to be done... \"So I think it's a good opportunity. Energy independence, using all these different sources of energy, should be a tier-one political issue from now on, rather than tier five... \"But it's an interesting question. Why has it taken so long in the UK and Europe, compared with the US? We can ponder that, or alternatively we can just do what this government is doing, which is to roll up the sleeves, simplify the process, make the permissions easier, getting on with getting some wells moving. \"By the end of this year, there should be some unconventional gas wells up and running that we can demonstrate, and I think the enthusiasm for it will grow. \"So I'm confident we'll win the argument, not least by sort of demonstrating that this is a good technology that will be good for our country.\" Reuters said last night that Cameron had made energy independence a priority for Europe: Energy independence and the adoption of technologies like shale gas fracking should top Europe's political agenda, Prime Minister David Cameron said on Tuesday, calling the Crimea crisis a \"wake-up call\" for states reliant on Russian gas. The Telegraph reported that Cameron had made fracking Britain's \"duty\" and that opponents were ill-informed. Britain has a \"duty\" to embrace fracking in the wake of the Ukraine crisis, David Cameron has said, as he accused opponents of shale gas exploration of not \"understanding\" the issue properly. The Daily Mail implied the UK itself was dependent on Russian gas supply. Britain has a duty to step up fracking to reduce dependence on gas from Russia, the Prime Minister said yesterday. The prime minister was clear in his statements that only a tiny fraction of Britain's gas mix was Russian. The Mail said this may not be true. Officially the UK imports less than 1 per cent of its gas from Russia. But Moscow-owned firm Gazprom claims it could be as high as 15 per cent indirectly, as Britain’s buys gas from other European countries such as Germany at peak times, which originates from Russia. The Mail also said that energy industry 'insiders' were baffled by the PM's assertion that shale gas wells could be online within the year. Europe's shale gas advocates say the Ukraine crisis highlights the need to develop indigenous energy sources, weaning the continent off Russia's huge reserves of natural gas. In the UK, Tory politicians have been queuing up push the shale gas agenda. Yesterday prime minister David Cameron entered the fray, saying fracking would be \"good for our country\" and that pursuing its reserves was Britain's \"duty\". Speaking to reporters after a nuclear security summit in Brussels, Cameron said: \"I think something positive should come out of [the situation in Ukraine] for Europe which is to take a long hard look at its energy resilience, and its energy independence. And I hope it will lead to some really useful work being done. \"Britain is not reliant on Russian gas to any extent, it's just a few percentage points of our gas intake. But the variety around Europe is very, very wide. Some countries are almost 100% reliant on Russian gas so I think it is something of a wake-up call and I think action will be taken.\" The prime minister and his Tory colleagues have long been vocal advocates for fracking. But Cameron's invocation of the threatening Russian bear needs examination. Is this pragmatism or opportunism? And is shale gas a necessary part of the cure for Europe's Gazprom addiction?

There will also be a shakeup of another system of privatised utilities, through a water bill that will make it easier for organisations to switch water suppliers and encourage new entrants into the market. But the proposals set out in the Queen's speech held no surprises, and few details of how the reforms will work in practice. On both sets of new regulations, large areas of policy detail remain unclear. Some energy experts fear \"contracts for difference\" in the electricity market – the centrepiece of the electricity market reforms – may be too complex in practice. The government said the system – by which suppliers of low-carbon electricity, from nuclear or renewable sources, could sign long-term contracts of supply at a preferential rate – \"would provide more certainty of revenues for low-carbon generation and make investment in clean energy more attractive\". Keith Allott, head of climate change at WWF-UK, said: \"While it is great that the government have accepted the principle of legislating for carbon emissions, the way it is currently drawn up simply won't work. You are not on a diet if you allow yourself 5,000 calories a day. You shouldn't be surprised if it has no effect.\" As yet there is no clarity on how the price for such contracts will be set, and how long the contracts will be allowed to run. John Cridland, director general of the CBI, said more detail was needed. \"Business investment in low-carbon will only happen when the detailed market framework is in place. Today's announcements are an important stepping stone,\" he said. Some welcomed the proposals. Nick Winser, executive director of National Grid, which is hoping to play a central role in brokering the contracts, said: \"There is a lot of work to do to ensure we are ready to deliver these mechanisms and we remain committed to playing our part and working closely with the Department of Energy and Climate Change, the energy industry and other stakeholders to ensure they are delivered on time.\" Other aspects of the energy bill include an emissions performance standard that would prevent the construction of new coal plants emitting more than 450 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour; a capacity mechanism that is supposed to ensure security of electricity supply and prevent blackouts; and a new regulator for nuclear power, the Office for Nuclear Generation. The water bill, which would reform aspects of the privatised water industry, is likely to attract particular attention given the drought crisis over much of England. The aims of the bill include stimulating the market for water resources, \"potentially unlocking new sources of water supply and reducing the impacts of future drought\", and reforms to the ways in which rights to take water from rivers and underground sources are allocated. However, it is unclear how these aims would be achieved. One of the chief problems facing water companies in the worst affected areas is the difficulty of gaining planning permission for infrastructure projects, such as new reservoirs and waste water treatment systems. There was no mention of water meters, which some experts believe will be essential to saving water. Phil Burston, water policy officer at the RSPB, said: \"It's disappointing we won't actually see a real draft water bill for some considerable time, which we consider a sad reflection on the priority government is giving water management issues.\" He said the RSPB urgently wanted to see commitments on full water metering for households. Rose Timlett, WWF-UK's freshwater expert, said: \"With half the country in drought and aquifer levels still resoundingly low, time is running out for the government to take action on water. It is enormously welcome that the bill includes powers to reform the water abstraction system – which is currently unfair, out of date and a threat to our rivers and wildlife.\" She added: \"The government also needs to ensure that the bill addresses the huge amount of water that is currently wasted, putting an end to the red tape that currently prevents water companies from installing water meters, even when it's in the best interest of customers and the environment.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2016/jun/07/australian-election-2016-turnbull-shorten-coalition-greens-labor-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-07T06:29:45Z","webTitle":"Australian election 2016: poll shows 28% approve of company tax cut and 45% disapprove – politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/jun/07/australian-election-2016-turnbull-shorten-coalition-greens-labor-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2016/jun/07/australian-election-2016-turnbull-shorten-coalition-greens-labor-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Australian election 2016: poll shows 28% approve of company tax cut and 45% disapprove – politics live","bodyText":"I think we’ll pull up stumps for today. Let’s take stock. Malcolm Turnbull stepped outside his campaign to visit flood effected areas in NSW, but he did manage to tie up the question of the third election debate. Would it be a Sky News people’s forum in Brisbane tomorrow night or would it be something else? Something else was the verdict. Turnbull said the next head-to-head of the campaign would be online, hosted by news.com and Facebook, because he wasn’t going to respond to “decrees” from Sky News. Presumably it’s ok to make decrees yourself. Call that a benefit of Lodge occupation. Bill Shorten did think the day would be about the economy and apprentices and it was for him until he relocated for the flood tour in the afternoon. Shorten grabbed the opportunity of the third debate and also banked the Sky appearance tomorrow night, because .. birds in hand. It would be an insult to Queenslanders to do anything else was the rationale. The latest opinion poll shows the campaign still locked in a dead heat. The prime minister has gone backwards in terms of voter perceptions, Bill Shorten has gone both forward and backwards, because nothing is ever simple, is it? Here, for the record, are the primary votes for the combatants at the campaign mid-point – note Nick Xenophon who is just under half way to Greens levels and independents are on 10%. (Liberal/National 41%; Labor 36%; Greens 10%; Nick Xenophon Team 4%; Other/Independent 10%.) Speaking of Xenophon, he must be completely delighted by the attention he’s getting this campaign. You can take that as a comment. Thanks for your company throughout the day. Let’s resume in the morning. Bill Shorten is speaking to reporters now. It sometimes takes a disaster to bring out the best in people but I’ve got no doubt that what we will see here is, this club will rebuild, and damaged communities right through Australia will rebuild. He’s repeating the emergency services advice: stay away from rising water. Bill Shorten: Do not enter these flooded rivers and water courses and creeks. The current can be deceptive. Once a vehicle loses traction with the ground it becomes a diabolical trap. People must listen to the experts. There is nothing so important or so timely that you can’t afford to wait. We don’t want to see any more people lost to this terrible weather. Please, we have got the SES, they are not there just for the sake of it. If they give you good advice, please follow it. The Labor leader has made it to Sydney this afternoon. Attitudes to the leaders. Interesting, this. Malcolm Turnbull going backwards, Bill Shorten polarising voters. 33% of the survey say they have become less favourable toward Malcolm Turnbull over the last few weeks and 7% say they have become more favourable. While most (65%) Liberal voters say they have not changed their opinion, 19% say they have become less favourable. 20% say they have become more favourable toward Bill Shorten over the last few weeks and 21% say they have become less favourable. 42% of Labor voters have become more favourable and 6% less favourable. This is also mildly interesting. Who do you trust to better handle a range of issues. The ALP have picked up on two of the Coalition’s core issues over the course of the campaign. The Liberal party is trusted more to handle security and the war on terrorism (+18), management of the economy (+12) and controlling interest rates (+12). The Labor Party is trusted more to handle ensuring a quality education (+14%) and ensuring the quality of the health system (+13). Since this question was asked last month, Labor has improved its position on management of the economy (up 8) and security and the war on terrorism (up 5). Let’s look at the new Essential poll which has landed this afternoon. We can start with the company tax cuts. 28% approve of the Coalition’s tax cuts to medium and large business and 45% disapprove. The government has repositioned on the tax cuts significantly. The reposition began at the leaders’ debate at the National Press Club: now the policy is being dressed up as a small business boost, with the benefits to big business to flow waaaaay waaaaay off in the distance. Suspect being crashed by BuzzFeed was not part of the campaign plan. It looks like the prime minister is now back in Sydney, at Watson’s Bay. Anyone want to use 3GB of data to watch the future, starring Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten? I’m so for the future it’s not funny, I’m a paid up member of the virtual world, that’s a given – but all the Facebook live streams I’ve seen this campaign have been buggy as anything. #JustSaying Labor CHQ has issued a statement about the Facebook/news.com debate. Bill Shorten is having his cake and eating it too: stage all to himself in Brisbane, another debate opportunity with Turnbull, and a slap to the prime minister on the way through. Bill Shorten: I’m happy to debate Mr Turnbull anytime, anywhere. But if he doesn’t front up at the people’s forum tomorrow, he is turning his back on Queenslanders – plain and simple. He’s been in hiding from voters this election, refusing to justify his plans for a tax handout for big business and cuts to schools and Medicare. If he doesn’t turn up tomorrow, it’s an insult to Queenslanders. We need to take stock before moving forward, to quote another prime minister in another campaign, long long ago. The prime minister has suspending campaigning to stop by flood-effected areas in NSW, dropping along the way confirmation that he will not turn up to the Sky News people’s forum in Brisbane, scheduled for tomorrow evening – the Labor leader will have that event all to himself – but he will turn up for an online debate hosted by Facebook and news.com because .. the future, and Rupert. Mind the bugs and the data allowances folks, the future is now. The Labor leader Bill Shorten’s campaign plan was to talk about the economy and jobs, with a new commitment on apprentices. He managed that in Adelaide before winging his way back to the east coast for his own flood visitations. Shorten left the former prime minister John Howard in Adelaide campaigning for Liberal Jamie Briggs, who we can conclude is embattled as a consequence of the fire power being trained on his electorate of Mayo. And so it goes. Messy business, flood touring. I’ll post a summary next. Bronwyn Bishop is on Sky just at the moment trying to say as little as she can possibly get away with about past events. (Sky must be thrilled about the value of this tie up. Not. So. Much.) The hosts are trying valiantly to get something newsworthy on Tony Abbott, about the inference Bishop dropped during her final speech to parliament about the former prime minister – that she was asked to resign to protect him. Not. A. Cracker. Bronwyn Bishop, with an expression best characterised as complete contentment. Later rather than sooner. Let’s run, run away, very fast, from this End Times broadcasting spectacle. A press statement has been issued about the local government areas now subject to disaster relief. The LGAs are: Bega Blacktown Byron Camden Campbelltown Canterbury-Bankstown Central Coast City of Sydney Coffs Harbour Eurobodalla Fairfield Hornsby Inner West Kiama Ku-ring-gai Lane Cove Lismore Liverpool Maitland Northern Beaches Parramatta Penrith Port Macquarie-Hastings Queanbeyan-Palerang Randwick Ryde Shellharbour Shoalhaven Sutherland The Hills Tweed Waverley Willoughby Wingecarribee Wollondilly Wollongong Woollahra The Sky News journalist wants more information about this new debate proposal. Malcolm Turnbull smiles broadly but unleashes the shade on Sky. Malcolm Turnbull: What we’ve said normally – you would have approached us and sought to come to some arrangement. You chose not to do that and to issue in effect is a decree and we’ve said ‘no’. We’ve had a Sky people’s forum debate, the traditional press club debate, it is traditional to have three debates, so let’s have the third one in an innovative way and that every Australian can participate in, that allows the interactivity that the old formats that really come from the pre-smartphone, pre-social media era – the old formats, don’t allow for that interactivity. We are in 2016. This is the 21st century. This is the time of innovation. This is the most exciting time to be an Australian and to participate in an election debate in the media of our time. So that’s what we are going to do. (Cable TV. SO yesterday. But interesting of course that you can’t stiff News Corp. Take the debate from Sky, give it to news.com New era of technology, old era of media politics, one rule remains constant: never poke Rupert in the eye.) The prime minister is then asked about the debate. Will he be turning up tomorrow night in Brisbane for the Sky News people’s forum with Bill Shorten? No, is the Turnbull answer. He’s got another idea. He says there will be virtual debate, hosted by news.com and Facebook. Malcolm Turnbull: The aim is to hold it early next week ... The aim would be for this debate, this discussion, to be streamed across any platform that sought to do so. So over Facebook, news.com.au sites, broadcasters who wanted to take it, to get it as widely available as possible. So my aim is to have as big an audience as possible and to reach everyone, you have to use the devices which I noticed you are all holding in your hands. That’s the modern world. That’s the smart phone era. Malcolm Turnbull is then asked about amendments to the fair work laws to protect volunteers. He says he’s satisfied the government can fix this after the election. He’s then asked about the spend in marginal seats, the $1.7bn. Malcolm Turnbull says everything is accounted for in the budget. Turnbull is asked for an update on the situation in Tasmania, which he proceeds to provide. He says floodwaters are still rising in Launceston. One death confirmed. The Spirit of Tasmania is not sailing because of debris in the Devonport harbour. Three people remain missing “and I’ve not had further information on that. But the situation is the storm damage and the rising waters in northern Tasmania remain a very serious threat.” Q: Is there anything you can say to people living in Tasmania with families who might be watching this news about their situation? Malcolm Turnbull says stay out of flood waters and follow advice from the emergency services. Earlier today the Labor leader Bill Shorten fired a warning shot in the direction of the insurance industry. Don’t quibble, just support people in difficult circumstances. Malcolm Turnbull gets the question. No warning shots here. Q: What is your message to the insurance industry who in the past have looked at the definitions of flood and acts of God and so forth to deny people coverage, what is your message to them as they assess the claims of people affected in this area and others? Malcolm Turnbull: I’m sure the insurers will support these communities. This is very substantial storm damage. This was a storm, a cloud that dropped 200mm of rain in a very short time on Picton. That’s what’s happened. So this is storm damage. These waters have caused by that extraordinary down pour, concentrated on this location, which is why this community was so hard hit with this storm damage. The prime minister is asked who is covered by the disaster relief. Malcolm Turnbull: There are 37 LGAs covered. There is no cap to the total funding but there are limits on the particular grants given and loans as the premier said it is up to $130,000 and the interest rate is 1.38%. Q: Do you have an indication on how big the damage bill on this could be? Malcolm Turnbull: I don’t. I think it’s too early to say. Malcolm Turnbull: Can I also just say that Bill Shorten and I were in touch yesterday about the response to the disaster and we are absolutely united in thanking and supporting the communities that have been affected by these shocking storms and while we disagree on more than a few things at the moment in an election campaign, we are very much on the same page in supporting these communities and supporting the proposition that the federal government should do everything to help them get back on their feet. The NSW premier Mike Baird is announcing disaster declarations. We provide as much support as we can as quickly as we can. This will provide grants to low income households or supplies or goods and the chance to get the house back into order. Those grants will be there for them. For small businesses, low interest loans ... to enable them to restock and get on with the business and get in a position to trade again while dealing with challenges, such as insurance claims and other challenges. It helps them. It is also helpful for the local council in terms of grants and local money to help with roads and bridges. We’re here to support them, admire them and thank them. (The people of Picton, that is. This is the prime minister speaking.) The prime minister opens his press conference by noting that the weather over the weekend has been powerful, but not as powerful as the community spirit in Picton. Malcolm Turnbull: This is the best of Australia. These are tough times when nature flings her worst at us, but it’s when Australians respond the best. The prime minister is coming up in Picton shortly, I’ll post a summary on the other side of that press conference. Labor’s deputy senate leader Stephen Conroy is on Sky News at the moment and he’s being pursued about Labor’s decision to not means test the childcare package. How on earth did the shadow cabinet think that was a good idea, giving money to wealthy people who don’t need it? Conroy says the rationale was there is “real pressure” on every single family taking care of kids. But there’s not real pressure on a family comprised of a law partner and a medical specialist, host Peter Van-Onselen points out to his guest, entirely reasonably. Conroy admits the proposal was “kicked around” in the shadow cabinet (read, contested in the shadow cabinet) – but in the end “we came down on the side of leaving the structure as it was”. The prime minister has arrived in Picton with the NSW premier Mike Baird, and he’s been handed a baby. People are asking what they do before insurance comes through. Malcolm Turnbull talks about disaster relief options from the state government. Here’s the new Liberal ad on Bill Shorten and corporate tax cuts. Back to Scott Morrison, who for some reason, is anti-people mover. Scott Morrison: The Shorten alternative, together with the Greens and everyone else who gets into that Tarago they will drive around the country will be $100bn in additional taxes over the next 10 years. #StopTheTarago Meanwhile, on the other coast, the clean up effort in Picton. The prime minister will be there shortly. Here’s looking at you, Bill. Over in Perth, treasurer Scott Morrison is releasing a new attack ad on Bill Shorten. The ad uses Bill Shorten’s past support for lowering the corporate tax rate. Scott Morrison: Mr Shorten is just playing rank politics on this issue. He understands if he is honest with the Australian people, why this is a good plan for jobs and growth. It is only because he is playing politics that he has chosen to take this line with the Australian people. It is not a game, Bill. This is the success of our future economy, the jobs of millions of Australians depend on the continued investment and performance of these companies. Another couple of questions on the firefighters in Victoria. Bill Shorten again says Malcolm Turnbull is being political. First of all, we all know why Mr Turnbull turned up in this dispute, because he wants to distract from the fact he doesn’t have a positive agenda of his own. Mr Turnbull has never taken a great interest in industrial relations, other than being one of Tony Abbott’s rubber stamps when it came to WorkChoices. When it comes to standing up for volunteers, I submit please examine the Fair Work Act. Labor put in protections for volunteers. It was Liberal when the Fair Work Act was presented to the Senate after a series of amendments who voted against the Fair Work Act which contained these protections for volunteers. Mr Turnbull loves to talk a lot but when it comes to doing something, his actions often contradict what he says. Shorten is asked whether Labor proposes to change the current employer incentive payment applying to apprentices. The answer is there is “no intention to change the employer incentive payment.” Q: Will you admit that you are going to be giving $10,000 to millionaires? Will you admit that will happen? Bill Shorten: It is not means-tested – the child care rebate. Let’s be clear here, the cost of child care is spiralling. Families are literally making hard choices between whether in most cases, the mother goes to work and then sees the wages eaten up by child care, or she doesn’t work at all. This country cannot afford to be putting disincentives in the path of people working. Childcare is really important. It is important because it is the first time little children leave the house at all. It is important we have quality child care. Q: Are you prepared for Labor to preference the Liberal party over the Nick Xenophon team or is that something you can rule out? Bill Shorten: The preferences will be dealt with by our party as has always been the case. I am chasing not peoples’ second preference vote, I want their first preference vote for Labor. A question about the firefighters dispute in Victoria. Q: Is it disingenuous for you to proclaim your support for emergency services volunteers when you’re not prepared to stick up for CFA volunteers in Victoria against the united firefighters union? Bill Shorten says Malcolm Turnbull has weighed into this dispute for political reasons. I am glad you raised that issue. As I said yesterday and have said previously, I support our volunteers and career firefighters. I do expect the parties to resolve their disagreements and I do expect premier Andrews to be able to reach a settlement. I expect a settlement to occur. Shorten says Labor proposed in law that volunteer firefighters should be able to take leave from their employer and not suffer any adverse consequences as a result of their volunteer functions, specifically including firefighters. Labor put protections in for volunteers. Mr Turnbull’s party, on the final passage of this Fair Work bill, voted against it in the Senate. Labor has a good record on volunteers. A question about why Labor isn’t means testing its childcare policy. Bill Shorten: Historically it has never been means tested. For the government to run a Robin Hood argument that they are the Green Left Weekly, the socialists of child care policy, is rubbish. Q: Will you rule out forming government with the Nick Xenophon party in a hung parliament? Bill Shorten: Nick Xenophon has to get some seats in the parliament. I am committed to Labor forming a government in our own right. I won’t deal with a hypothetical issue. What I say to South Australians and Australians, if you think your Medicare system is important, vote Labor. If you want to see a Royal Commission into the banks, vote Labor. If you want to see schools properly funded, vote Labor. If you want more apprenticeships available, vote Labor. If you want fair taxation, vote Labor. If you want to see first home buyers able to enter the market, vote Labor, if you want to see Australian jobs created, maintained and be well paid, vote Labor. Q: Are you going to Sydney to inspect the storm damage and suspending your campaigning. Would you prefer to do it with the PM given it is bipartisan? Bill Shorten: I contacted the prime minister and offered to visit storm and flood-affected regions with him. I’m happy to do it with him. The issue is not Mr Turnbull or I, it is the people experiencing loss, and damage. I will make this point and I have no reason to be concerned about it, but I worked heavily during the Brisbane floods to make sure insurance companies treated their claimants of policies properly, I want to send a message out to the insurance companies of Australia, I am sure you will do this, but make sure that you treat your customers fairly. Make sure you deal with their claims in a speedy fashion. For people who have suffered significant damage, the last thing they need is to be damaged again by a long argument with an insurance company. Questions now. Q: Former prime minister John Howard this morning has drawn a parallel between Independent Senator Nick Xenophon and Pauline Hanson saying both are trying to exploit fears when it comes to trading with Asian nations. What do you make of these comments? And are you concerned about the growing support for Nick Xenophon here in SA? Bill Shorten: I heard the Liberal party called John Howard off the bench to come and help beleaguered Jamie Briggs in Mayo. This is the reunion of the work choices warriors. We know that as long as there is a Liberal party, workers’ conditions in this country are never safe. I notice Mr Howard’s attacking Senator Xenophon but bizarrely, Senator Xenophon and Mr Howard are on a unity ticket when it comes to undermining penalty rates in this country. If you want to protect the rights of workers, make sure there are harmonious work places, if you want to make sure apprentices are getting properly trained, you wouldn’t look at the Liberals or Senator Xenophon, you would vote Labor. Q: The second question, are you concerned about the growing support that Senator Xenophon has in SA? Bill Shorten: There is only two parties who can form a government. The Liberal party or the Labor party. A vote for the minor parties will not help change a government. The Labor leader first addresses the flood visit that will happen later today. Mr Turnbull and I understand that there are things more important when crisis hits than the day to day political rancour. This is a moment where the nation supports people in trouble. It is fair to say that in the worst of times, we see the best of Australia. I look forward to seeing and working with the volunteers and thanking them on behalf of many Australians. Then to today’s commitment on apprenticeships. Bill Shorten: Labor will insist upon a proportion of apprentices being employed on Commonwealth funded work, specifically on the top ten projects which will be funded by the concrete bank, we will want to see one in every ten employees being apprentices. We want to make sure for projects which have a capital expenditure of over $10m, that we sit down with the states and territories and make sure a proportion of the jobs are going to apprentices. (By concrete bank I assume he means the infrastructure investment facility Labor has promised.) Lots of questions about Nick Xenophon taking balance of power and a lower house seat. John Howard: That’s his aspiration, not my expectation. I don’t believe he’ll get any lower house seats. Howard says we shouldn’t over estimate Nick Xenophon, he’s part of a worldwide trend of voters not being as partisan as they once were, flirting with political outsiders. You can’t govern the country with 150 independents, Howard says, you have to back a major party. Otherwise .. *chaos*. How about preferences? John Howard says he’s certain the Liberal party will make decisions about preferences based on principle and policies and not political manipulations. He’s asked whether he’s detected any mood for change in the electorate, any anger? John Howard: I don’t find anger. The former prime minister says he thinks the campaign is taking time to gather momentum because of the length of the contest, but the voters are placid. Howard is asked why he’s stumping in a safe Liberal seat. John Howard: It’s often in these safe seats that people can sneak up on you. Speaking of John Howard he’s bobbed up in the seat of Mayo. That’s the purpose of his visit today, stumping for Liberal MP Jamie Briggs, who worked for him as prime minister. Howard says he hopes the good people of Mayo will vote for Briggs because that’s a vote to return the Turnbull government. John Howard: He’s the Turnbull Liberal here in Mayo. (Please ignore the fact you may not like Jamie. You are voting for Malcolm. Over.) Nick Xenophon has responded to John Howard earlier this morning likening him to Pauline Hanson on free trade during a radio interview. Nick Xenophon: At a personal level, I’ve always liked John Howard, and I’m very grateful that he’s given the Nick Xenophon Team so much oxygen in SA with his attack. Deep down I think he must really like me, as evidenced by his comments on me following the 2013 election. Free trade agreements are a good thing if they are negotiated with our national economic interest in mind. The fact that the trade deficit with China has increased at 15% a year since the Howard-era FTA says it all. It’s running very prominently on our website so I can’t imagine you’d miss it but in the event – our environment reporter Mikey Slezak has produced a deep dive (excuse the pun) on the Great Barrier Reef which is a must read. Climate change is very much in the background this election. Labor isn’t prosecuting it as a frontline issue despite the obvious weakness Malcolm Turnbull has on this subject, which tells you a lot about the toxic politics of the past few years. The view from Adelaide this morning, courtesy of Fairfax photographer Alex Ellinghausen. Regular reader Tim Senior has some pictures on his Facebook page of the Picton clean up currently underway. Thanks Tim. Mike Bowers tells me the prime minister is en route to Picton for the flood inspections. Q: Are you going to back off describing Malcolm Turnbull as the rich toff that he is, because he’s come out and told us how he struggled as a young man? Bill Shorten: I’m not going to judge his antecedents or his background and I want to make it clear here. Mr Turnbull’s wealth is not a problem for me. I congratulate him on having amassed the money he has. But its his out of touch views. The point of it is he could be a brickie and if he had these views I would say he was out of touch. Q: He’s not the one saying the women are the primary caregivers and the ones who make decisions about child care? Bill Shorten: I’ll come to that in a minute but I will just finish the question for David first. The issue there is he’s got out of touch views. I don’t know why he’s protecting the banks from a royal commission, I don’t know why he wants to dismantle Medicare. I don’t know why he won’t properly fund schools. I don’t know why he wants to give $7.5bn to the big banks bottom line. I was making the observation, not that there aren’t dads doing work, of course there are, but the burden, disproportionately falls upon women in Australia and we need to have a national conversation, how government policies support working mums ... Labor’s policies about the equal treatment of women in our society from family violence to child care, to paid parental leave, I think we’ve got the goods for working women in this country. Bill Shorten is asked whether South Australia will get all the ship building work if Labor wins the election. Yes, is Shorten’s answer. Then some delicate phraseology follows. Q: So if Victoria and Kim Carr think they’re going to get a share of what’s been allocated to SA forget it? Bill Shorten: I’ve got no doubt there will be work for shipyards around Australia but the deal is that SA is to build the submarines Q: I’m not talking about just the subs, the whole lot? We are committed to seeing SA as the centre for ship building excellence. Q: Labor is going to tax superannuation earnings for retirees in the pension phase. They’re currently tax free. The ALP is going to tax annual earnings above $75,000 at 15%. Why are you taking money away from people who are providing for their own retirement? Bill Shorten: First of all, Mr Howard and Mr Costello in 2006-7 when there were rivers of gold coming in from the mining boom, got rid of what used to be called the reasonable benefits limit in superannuation and without over complicating the description, what that meant is that when we created superannuation, and Labor created it, there was always a view that above a certain amount of money you wouldn’t give the same preferential tax treatment because what you’re doing is creating for some lucky individuals a tax windfall. So there was always – there was always up to 2006-7 – some taxation increase in superannuation. Howard and Costello got rid of it. It is not sustainable at the top end .. Q: What’s magical about $75,000, you think that’s fair, do you? Bill Shorten: We do think that was fair. Q: Are you going to index that? Bill Shorten: That’s not in our policy. Q: So as inflation takes care of this, that means more and more people will hit that $75,000, won’t they? Bill Shorten: Yes, but what I’d also say, before we start having some big panic about Labor’s policies on superannuation, is that we’re proposing 15% for income above that. This is the interest earned from superannuation. Very few Australians are earning $75,000 in interest but if you earn more than that you will be paying 15% on the amount above that. Q: You won’t index that, though? Bill Shorten: That’s not in our policy. Bill Shorten is back now on the ABC in Adelaide. He’s asked why people are voting for Nick Xenophon. Bill Shorten: I think people are frustrated with the government of the day, the Liberals, and I think that the challenge for Labor is to explain our positive policies, our alternative. And in the meantime people may decide they may want to vote for a third party. One thing I don’t ever do is blame voters. I accept that there’s things I can control and the things I can’t. What I can control is how Labor presents its views and do our ideas actually make a real difference in people’s lives? I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about the things I can’t control. What people expect, I believe, of the opposition, the Labor party, is what would we do differently to Mr Turnbull and what are our priorities and this election is all about choices. Q: If it’s a hung parliament, would you be able to work - would you form a coalition with the Xenophon team? I mean we’re blue skying here but it’s something you’d have to think about? Bill Shorten: I have to say in this election I’ve been focusing on getting as many votes as I can. We’ve indicated that we don’t want to see a hung parliament and what we will do is do absolutely everything we can in the next 24 days to convince South Australians and Australians to vote for us. Quick recap of Bill Shorten from Triple M earlier today. Nuclear is a theme. The hosts started with a few tough questions on nuclear storage and comments by Penny Wong about returning to surplus within 10 years. Shorten made the distinction between the “full-on nuclear cycle” (including generating nuclear power) and low grade waste, the latter of which he said would be “a good thing to look at for jobs”. But Shorten said it will be “hard to catch up on the nuclear industry in terms of the cost of establishing it” and renewable energy would be the focus if Labor were elected. On budget plans, Shorten said Labor would “be revealing our plan to credibly bring the budget back to balance” and said “it won’t take 10 years” to do so. “We’re making sure that anything we say we’ll invest or spend, we can match with improvements to budget bottom line ... We’re committed to budget repair, but we add three extra words, budget repair that is fair.” After the hard stuff, the Triple M hosts turned the interview over to a call from ‘Big Mal’ - a Malcolm Turnbull impersonator. ‘Big Mal’ was full of jibes about Turnbull, saying “nobody enjoys listening to me more than me” and saying pressing the flesh with voters was no fun because “they’re germy - I need hand sanitiser”. Shorten then spoke about how he’d only be home for seven nights in the marathon 56 day campaign, and there was nobody to pick up after Theo and Tilly, his family’s British bulldogs. John Howard is asked about nuclear energy, which he pursued unsuccessfully as prime minister in his final term in office. Howard’s support for nuclear drew him along the path to supporting emissions trading in 2007. Nuclear was only viable with a carbon price so Howard said, ok then, let’s have the darned carbon price, which was Liberal party policy until the abject future trashing ludicrousness of Tony Abbott and the anti carbon “tax” campaign. Howard is still firmly stuck in his late 2000’s paradigm about baseload power. At the time of the nuclear review, it was correct to say that baseload power needed the bedrock of either nuclear generation or fossil fuel generation, but that’s no longer the case. Renewables have undergone a revolution over the last ten years, increasing both in effectiveness and in cost-effectiveness. But Howard insists this morning nuclear needs to be part of Australia’s future because if you want baseload power you need fossil fuels. Yeah, nah. Not anymore. Somebody needs to get a new brief to the former prime minister. He’s asked does he regret departing from political life? John Howard: Oh no I’m a realist. Howard says he follows the fortunes “of my party very closely. I want it to succeed.” He says he hope Malcolm Turnbull remains in power. Then the campaign line. John Howard: I think what the public wants is a bit of stability and if you want that there’s only one bloke to vote for and that’s Malcolm Turnbull. John Howard is being interviewed by David Pemberthy on 5AA. He’s asked first about tribalism, are voters less tribal? Yes, Howard thinks. People are less deliberate in their voting habits. They are less tribal. It’s a world wide phenomenon, he says. Q: So Nick Xenophon is part of this global trend? John Howard: That is true, although his original issue, the anti-poker machines stance, caught the public mood. Howard says Xenophon now purports to have a view on everything. You had Pauline Hanson, Pemberthy points out to Howard. Do you see a parallel with Xenophon on anti free trade? Yes, there’s a parallel, John Howard says. He takes this as a cue to defend trade liberalisation. “How anybody would pussy foot about supporting these agreements is beyond me.” Howard is asked about his friendship with Tony Abbott. Does he campaign for Turnbull with any sense of melancholy? John Howard: I campaign for a Liberal government. Abbott will always be a good friend of mine, Howard says, but the party room made a decision. The party room now needs to respect the decision. He says he’s known Malcolm Turnbull well for a long time, not as close “on a friendship basis” as with Abbott. But Howard says Turnbull is the man to run the economy. A man who says he’ll lead the country like a trade union official is not the man to run the country, Howard says. (He means Bill Shorten in case that isn’t clear.) Paul Karp will give us a bit of Shorten on FM radio shortly, and we also have John Howard coming up on Adelaide radio. Has South Australia ever felt so loved in an election cycle? Calla gave you a flavour of this a minute ago but another quick post on Bill Shorten on 5AA. Today’s focus for Labor is jobs. Shorten said Labor would set a target that on its top 10 infrastructure projects 10% of workers should be apprentices. Asked whether Labor has a hostile relationship with business, Shorten said: “We don’t have a hostile relationship with business, I have a very good relationship with them. If elected I will work with business but I won’t work solely for business.” He described the election in terms of choices between the Coalition’s $48bn corporate tax cut and Labor’s greater spending on health and education, and said a health and skilled workforce are “the best investment you can give business”. Shorten was asked about his earlier promise to “govern like a unionist”, and what that meant in the context of “aberrant” behaviour by the construction union and the Victorian firefighters’ union’s bid to gain greater control over volunteers. In response he said as a unionist he had fought for middle and working class Australians’ pay and conditions, he understood how people earned a living and was in touch with their needs, unlike Malcolm Turnbull. But, he said “I’d work with groups but not for any particular group ... I will work with representatives of workers, but not for them”. It’s interesting to see when challenged by the idea he is too close to the union movement, Shorten has adopted a similar formulation to his relationship with business. The Labor leader Bill Shorten is in the process of doing two radio interviews in Adelaide before launching today’s policy, which is on apprenticeships, then relocating to NSW to tour flood damaged areas, most likely in the northern beaches. Right now, Shorten is taking a call from a Malcolm Turnbull impersonator in Adelaide. “Big Mal.” Bill Shorten is laughing like this is fun while trying to say as little as possible. Then he moves on to his home duties, which Shorten says focus predominantly on cleaning up dog mess in the back yard. Thanks Calla, good morning everyone and welcome to Tuesday. I want to kick off this morning with a few observations about the Q&amp;A program which was broadcast from the north west NSW centre of Tamworth last night. Normally, I find Q&amp;A completely unwatchable, like the worst power ballad drenched stadium rock you’ve every experienced. But last night, the program served its purpose of bringing the public in, and pushing the politicians off their talking points, so it was a terrific hour of current affairs. What it served to highlight was the realignment currently underway in regional Australia. My colleague Gabi Chan has written compellingly on this subject in a campaign essay about the bush. I encourage you to have a read. I grew up in Tamworth. I know the region very well. The Tamworth of my childhood was a small and deeply conservative place, tribal to the boot straps. Contemporary Tamworth is a much bigger and less conservative place. Tamworth and the surrounding electorate of New England has been at the pointy end of regional Australia choosing to experiment with alternatives to the major parties, looking for opportunities to send Canberra a message that politics as usual just isn’t good enough. Barnaby Joyce (who also grew up in the same part of the world as me) came to Canberra understanding that an anti-establishment mindset and public posture posture was critical to success as a regional politician. He thought coalitionism was killing the Nationals and said as much. When he arrived in Canberra, he was fiercely independent, driving colleagues in the government completely bonkers by refusing to line up obediently on critical votes. Now, as Gabi notes in her essay, Joyce has transitioned successfully from maverick to a coalitionist in a maverick suit. But as one of the questioners made clear in a question, the electorate does face a stark choice for a country seat in this election contest – vote out the leader of the Nationals and a deputy prime minister in favour of an independent motivated potentially by spite. Tony Windsor soundly rejected that analysis of course, as did a good chunk of the audience, but that sentiment you’d expect would work more than it wouldn’t in Joyce’s favour on the ground. As is said in the classics, only time will tell. As well as the personalities for the New England contest, viewers in metro areas will have consumed a flavour of what matters to Australians west of the divide. The major flashpoints last night were coal seam gas development, and the national broadband network, as well as the usual concerns about the quality of services. With that so noted, let’s press on. A reminder today’s comments thread is open for your business. If the thread’s too bracing for you, Mike Bowers and I are up and about on the twits – he’s @mpbowers and I’m @murpharoo. If you only speak Facebook you can join my daily forum here. And if you want a behind-the-scenes look at the day and the campaign as a whole, give Mike a follow on Instagram. There’s some beauties there from yesterday. You can find him here. Keep the gortex handy, here comes Tuesday. Jay Weatherill says Bill Shorten ran “at a good clip” this morning, so perhaps I should stop worrying about his health. On that distressingly maternal note, I’m going to hand over to Katharine Murphy to guide you through the rest of the day. See you again bright and early tomorrow. Bill Shorten has been asked about the CFA industrial dispute on Adelaide’s FiveAA radio. He has maintained the dispute was a Victorian state issue, but here he is, on South Australian local radio, being asked whether he would back the United Firefighters Union over 60,000 CFA volunteers. He doesn’t really answer. I will work with representatives of workers but not for them. Shorten says he works well with SA premier Jay Weatherill and went on a 7km run with him this morning (which may not have been a good idea- the opposition leader sounds a bit peaky). What about Malcolm Turnbull’s videos about his father, do they disprove Labor’s construction of the PM as a “Point Piper dandy”? Shorten says that’s beside the point. I’ve got no objections to Malcolm Turnbull’s wealth, it’s just the views that he holds. Will we see a sepia-tinted Shorten origin story in response? Apparently not - his parents were rather lax about recording his childhood. Football teams and school photos seem to be the only proof of my existence from zero to 18. There’s been a late change in Bill Shorten’s diary. He has reportedly suspended his campaign and will head to NSW to tour flood-affected areas. It’s not clear whether he will keep any engagements in Adelaide before jumping back on the plane. He is due on SA radio in a few minutes. The media convoys are on the move. Team Shorten has touched down in Adelaide, while Team Turnbull is on the plane in Melbourne bound for the NSW southern highlands. Let’s touch back on an issue that has perhaps not been getting the traction it deserves in the election campaign: legal funding. Labor’s Tanya Plibersek and Mark Dreyfus are set to make an announcement about funding for community legal centres in Sydney today. The Coalition has been rather absent from this debate. My colleague Richard Ackland drilled down into this issue on the Behind the Lines podcast last week. It’s worth a listen, you can find it here or in the internet wireless app of your choice. Here’s a round-up of the morning papers. Storms and flooding, understandably, dominate. Half the sky, all of the ironing Malcolm Turnbull’s self-declared feminism is apparently not shared by all the Liberal party rank and file. Shocking, I know. Enter David Kingston, the LNP challenger to Wayne Swan’s seat of Lilley, who draws his understanding of gender theory from a set of monogrammed towels. He outlined his views in a travel blog, as the Courier Mail reports: Mr Kingston made comments about women’s chores, women’s work and how he was surprised a woman could drive a truck. “Ever since I was little I can remember my Mum and Dad used to put up HIS and HERS towels in the bathroom … from that I realised there were things designed for men and others designed for women,” he wrote. “And I reasoned that the pattern would extend to some other things in life too (such as chores).” Sound reasoning. More gems from Kingston: Donna likes to call me chauvinistic from time to time but I see it differently. Donna got busy with some women’s work – washing clothes.” I got a bit of a shock when it was a woman who stepped out of the truck.” It all sounds very familiar. Turnbull, the Courier Mail reports, refused to defend Kingston’s comments. In the immortal words of Anthony Albanese: Good. Set your alarm: John Howard is back on the wireless. That’s an Adelaide radio station, so it’s 8.30am central time (9am AEDT). Malcolm Turnbull has released a second video about his father and his upbringing, in an apparent attempt to position him as a man of the people. Which is very heartwarming but, as Caroline Overington writes in The Australian, it doesn’t make him a battler. Turnbull’s team is trying to present this background as one of great difficulty. They should ask a family of true battlers what an ugly marriage bust-up really looks like, because divorce is indeed the sink-or-swim moment for people who truly live in poverty. One party usually ends up in the local caravan park, or else on somebody’s couch. In the turmoil that follows, the kids can very easily drop out of school. If there’s alcohol involved, the driver’s licence will soon be gone, and with it a source of income. Then the new boyfriend moves in with Mum. Then the teenage daughter moves out. That’s what ‘battling’ really looks like It is quite an odd line for the Coalition to pursue. I doubt anyone will seriously buy Turnbull as anything but a bundle of privileges, and that’s ok, so long as people trust him to lead the country. He doesn’t need to be an everyman, he needs to be a prime minister. Before we get into politics proper, let’s have a quick public safety warning via NSW emergency services minister David Elliott. He’s in Coogee this morning waiting for the sun to come up so he can see how much damage was caused by a king tide yesterday. Elliott tells Radio Nation’s Frank Kelly that the three people who died are believed to have been attempting to drive through flood waters. It’s like walking into a bushfire. You just don’t take the risk. So: do not drive through flood waters. He’s taking a stern personal responsibility line on fixing the damage caused to coastal homes in Sydney in all that wild weather yesterday. I don’t know what the government can do to encourage people not to buy coastal homes. Hello and welcome to day 30 of the election campaign. If you’re feeling fatigued, take heart: pre-poll voting opens in exactly one week so very soon you will be able to tune out, democratic duty done. But, for now, take a bracing swig of tea and let’s press on. The big picture The election campaign has taken a back seat to devastating floods in New South Wales, the ACT and Tasmania. There are fears the death toll could rise as high as seven. Among the worst-hit areas is the north-west Tasmanian town of Latrobe, which is under water. In political matters, the industrial dispute over the Country Fire Authority in Victoria continues to provide fuel for Malcolm Turnbull, who is using it to discuss new legislation restricting union powers. The Australian reports that Turnbull will block unions from striking “secret deals”, whatever that means. I’ll let the Oz’s David Crowe and Rick Wallace explain: Employment Minister Michaelia Cash told The Australian the government was considering changes to the Fair Work Act to shield the Victorian volunteers from the union’s attempts to extend its power over the firefighting authority. “We are considering a number of possible amendments to the Fair Work Act that would address this issue,” Senator Cash said. “There is a clear pattern of behaviour when it comes to secret deals between unions and Labor governments which only benefits unions at the expense of all others. Whether it is destroying the livelihoods of truck drivers at the behest of the TWU, locking contractors out of the construction industry at the behest of the CFMEU or destroying the volunteer CFA at the behest of the UFU, Labor’s utter weakness in the face of greedy union bosses comes at an enormous cost to the community.” The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, appeared to back down on the deal last night, with his government now saying they will help the CFA and continue negotiations with the United Firefighters Union. I wrote an explainer about the dispute here. On the campaign trail Malcolm Turnbull has suspended his campaign for the day to tour flood affected areas in New South Wales. Three people have been confirmed dead in the floods: two in New South Wales and one in the ACT. In Tasmania four people are missing, feared dead. Bill Shorten is in South Australia, where he plans to talk about apprenticeships. He has offered to suspend his campaign and join Turnbull touring flood zones – no word yet on Turnbull’s response but I think we can expect Shorten in flood areas soon. The campaign you should be watching Labor is reportedly concerned about the affect the CFA industrial dispute could have on its campaign for marginal Victorian seats, particularly McEwan, held by Labor’s Rob Mitchell, and Corrangamite, held by Liberal MP Sarah Henderson. The Age’s Richard Willingham writes that both seats are in high-risk bushfire zones. McEwan and Shorten are hoping voters quarantine the dispute as a state issue. And another thing(s) It appeared viewers weren’t the only people terribly bored during the National Press Club leaders debate. Malcolm Turnbull says that if he’s to participate in another debate, he wants it to include questions from Facebook, which is a very on-brand demand. Gareth Hutchens has more: The prime minister’s office believes the format of the first debate suited the opposition because few of the audience questions were about the economy, and it thinks the format of the second debate was too boring for the public to engage with it. Turnbull would like the format of the next debate to be more attractive for voters, particularly disengaged voters in marginal electorates. With that goal in mind, he would like voters who will not be able to attend the event to still have the chance to engage directly with it. That means having some kind of system that allows questions to be submitted live via Facebook and answered by the prime minister and opposition leader. But the details of such a plan remain vague.

For example, he will not stop ringfencing health and aid spending. And he will not scrap the Climate Change Act, as Simon Richards urges on ConservativeHome today. (Simon is of course right to suggest that the driver of some green taxes is green targets.) The chancellor will not means-test the winter fuel allowance or free bus passes or free TV licences for older people. The list below consists of actions that he could take. • Build more homes on publicly owned land: The only way of both getting more homes built quickly between now and the next election while minimising rows with local councils (many of them Conservative) is to build on land that the government already owns, is making no use of, and doesn't need. Downing Street needs to lead a drive to get departments to let the land go. (The government claims that it will have released land with capacity for 62,000 homes by 2016.) • Cut NI contributions: As Peter Hoskin reminds us today, the chancellor announced an NICs cut in the last budget. The employment allowance let all companies off the first £2,000 of their national insurance contributions – eliminating the bills altogether for 450,000 firms and a third of all employers, according to the Treasury. Increasing the allowance to cover more firms and employers is an obvious course to take. • Move to cut tax on cash savings: Osborne is in no position to scrap benefits for better-off pensioners, given Conservative campaign pledges at the last election, but there's no reason whatsoever why he shouldn't announce a review as a way of preparing the ground. The Liberal Democrats would not object. That would allow him to move towards the bargain that Liam Fox has previously floated – scrapping the benefits but abolishing tax on cash savings in banks. • Public spending commission: As I wrote yesterday, the Conservatives don't have the political credibility to consider, let alone implement, ideas that must be on the table if we are to have – as ConservativeHome has put it and the chancellor now phrases it – \"affordable spending\" (and nor has any other party). These include raising the age at which the state pension is received further, and looking at co-payment for healthcare. • Cutting fuel duty: As Peter Hoskin also points out, Osborne pledged at party conference in the autumn that it will be frozen until 2015 dependent on the money being found. Much depends on the growth figures, but if the chancellor can find room for manoeuvre he ought to confirm that the cut will happen, and even make a modest cut if possible. With the possible exception of utility bills, nothing will be pressing voters in those northern and Midlands marginals more. • More nuclear power: Today's Telegraph returns us, amid the noise of battle over green taxes and levies, to the fact that the lights may go out next winter. The government ought to be slowing the green targets that are making the prospect more likely. Since that won't happen with the Liberal Democrats on board, and nuclear must play a role in keeping those lights on (in the medium term, anyway), Osborne ought to spell out what his next nuclear plans are. • Deficit reduction, deficit reduction, deficit reduction: I opened with a reference to Simon Richards's ideas, and close with one. Like Peter Hoskin, Simon is right to put continuing deficit reduction at the top of his list: indeed, today's Financial Times suggests that though the growth news for Osborne will be good, it won't be too good. Obviously, he won't simply leave taxes as they are: there are bound to be some reductions. I have restricted myself to two."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/sep/25/100bn-armageddon-weapon-wont-make-us-safer","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-25T04:59:00Z","webTitle":"Trident: this £100bn Armageddon weapon won't make us one jot safer | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/25/100bn-armageddon-weapon-wont-make-us-safer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/25/100bn-armageddon-weapon-wont-make-us-safer","fields":{"headline":"Trident: this £100bn Armageddon weapon won't make us one jot safer","bodyText":"It must rank as the daftest, costliest question in British politics. How many Trident submarines does Britain need? Medieval schoolmen sharpened their brains by counting angels on pinheads. British policymakers sharpen theirs by counting warheads on missiles. They know it is irrational but the money, the language, the whiz-bangs, the uniforms turn their heads and dazzle their minds. Ordinary guns and soldiers they can understand. They slash their costs with ease. But cut nuclear weapons? That would be risky. Every time I dip into the Trident debate I am reminded of Great War generals gulping on chateau champagne while the trenches filled with blood. David Cameron was confronted with a bold option on taking office: whether to cut back on Labour's glamour sea and air projects, many already out of date, and invest in the army instead. He flunked it. In the case of Trident, he muttered that his \"real concern\" was a threat from North Korea. It was mad. Last spring there were signs that Labour's Ed Miliband might summon up the guts at last to challenge the \"independent deterrent\", given that its submarine replacement would consume a third of defence procurement for a decade. The press was briefed that he was \"set to scrap Trident strategy\". He too flunked it. There was no mention of the most expensive project on the Treasury books in his speech yesterday. Earlier this month the Liberal Democrats mooted a scheme to keep submarines, but with their warheads locked up ashore. The idea had emerged to cut costs from within the Ministry of Defence, where a former minister, Nick Harvey, spoke of the \"frankly almost lunatic mindset\" among nuclear strategists. The idea was crushed by the union of former defence secretaries and service chiefs, led by Lords (George) Robertson and (Michael) Boyce. They dismissed it as \"hare-brained\". The entire debate is hare-brained. Nobody can explain when, where or how these terrible weapons would be deployed and used, despite the essence of deterrence being credibility. (Yet we want to bomb Syria for using far less drastic chemical ones.) They bear no reference to any plausible threat to Britain that could possibly merit their use. Meanwhile their possession by Britain is a blatant invitation to nuclear proliferation, making opposition to an Iranian bomb hypocritical. Yet Labour, like the Tories, is supporting a Trident renewal programme that is set to consume £20 billion and rise to a reputed £100bn over 20 years. Even current defence chiefs have been careful to excuse themselves from this debate, saying it is \"for politicians to decide\" on the deterrent, and for the Treasury to pay for it outside the defence budget (which the Treasury refuses). The mesmerising effect of \"the bomb\" on Labour recalls the party's ancient fear of being thought weak on defence. It was seen in Nye Bevan's shift from \"no first use\" to deriding disarmament as an \"emotional spasm\" that would send Britain \"naked into the conference chamber\". Labour's defence establishment ever since has striven to be more hawkish than any. In 1997 Tony Blair duly bought fighters, frigates and carriers in the greatest splurge of uncontrolled defence spending in peacetime. Seven years ago Chatham House published a debate on the deterrent by a distinguished group of British and US strategists, soldiers and historians. They calmly took apart the bombast and rhetoric, delivering a message of extreme scepticism. It was highly unlikely that the Soviets were deterred from attacking Britain during the cold war. Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser was certainly not deterred from seizing Suez, or General Galtieri from seizing the Falklands. Even Margaret Thatcher's favourite nuclear strategist, the late Michael Quinlan, pondered the then forecast £10bn renewal cost for Trident. He questioned \"the continuing effort and expenditure\" and doubted whether a British deterrent \"would still have worthwhile credibility\". The former head of US strategic air command was equally baffled. The British deterrent relied on US supplies and maintenance. Yet its use was predicated on America proving unreliable in deploying its deterrent against some putative attacker. The British deterrent had to be credible when America's was not. It made no sense. Reading the Chatham House study today is to realise how deaf politics can be to reason. Gordon Brown justified Trident as merely supplying \"Scottish jobs\". Blair wanted to be \"at the top table\", as does Cameron. Yet the New York Times reported in April that the US was pressing Britain to face financial reality, and \"either be a nuclear power and nothing else, or a real military partner\". If Britons wanted to police the world, they should sustain a well-equipped army, not posture as a nuclear power. Debates on defence are a miasma of fear, ignorance and fantasy. The cry of the defence lobby, that \"you can't put a price on security\" is rubbish. There is a price on every sort of security. What makes Trident peculiar is the tendency of the costs involved to rise, and the obscurity of its justification. The old maxim was never more true – that soldiers prepare for old wars not future ones. They are obsessively conservative. As a result, when not spending on Trident (a cold war weapon), they have induced the government to spend on old-fashioned carriers and manned fighter planes, just when long-distance drones are the weapon of the future. Yet the wars Britain is expected to fight, wars of political choice, demand equipment and tactics from not just past wars but past centuries. Enemies are immune to nuclear weapons and heavy armour, enemies who hurl grenades and wield Kalashnikovs made in 1947. In today's wars, as in Iraq and Afghanistan, Cameron's expensive procurements are an irrelevance. Nuclear deterrence is rooted in a balance of terror established briefly during the cold war. In the improbable event of those days returning, the west would stand together under America's nuclear umbrella or it would be doomed. The idea that Britain is made one jot safer by a £100bn Armageddon weapon floating in the Atlantic is absurd. Yet not absurd to everyone. The idea is the mental construct of a powerful lobby, the British navy, its cheerleaders and its suppliers, with their hands on stupefying amounts of public money and an ability to scare politicians into pandering to their interest. It is that interest, not Great Britain, that they are defending so vigorously. As a result the one policy on which all parties seem to agree is that Britain needs its own nuclear deterrent, which is nonsense."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/blog/2012/sep/21/nuclearpower-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-21T16:30:14Z","webTitle":"Should China be involved in the UK's nuclear energy infrastructure? | Paul Dorfman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/sep/21/nuclearpower-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2012/sep/21/nuclearpower-energy","fields":{"headline":"Should China be involved in the UK's nuclear energy infrastructure?","bodyText":"Government officials have been in Beijing this week with their Chinese counterparts for an \"unprecedented\" collaboration on energy. On the table was new nuclear power, and its role in moving the UK to a low-carbon economy. So far, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) has been relentlessly optimistic about new nuclear, and hopes that its electricity market reform plans for a draft energy bill will do the trick, despite strong and sustained criticism from a parliamentary select committee on energy, and more recently a House of Lords working group who conclude that the reforms are \"unworkable\". But Decc is still loyal to the nuclear project and hopes the financial support implied in these market reforms will attract foreign investment. France's state nuclear corporation EDF and their UK junior partner, Centrica, have been centre stage in this nuclear fiscal drama. Centrica appears increasingly lukewarm, and City insiders doubt whether it will maintain a 20% stake in the nuclear consortium. Centrica's potential departure could have something to do with the economics of nuclear power, with construction costs more than doubling from €3bn to over €6bn – and rising for each of the French-designed European pressurised reactors being built in Finland at Olkiluoto, and Flamanville in France. Separately, since Germany's RWE and E.ON in March pulled out of the UK's second nuclear consortium, Horizon Nuclear Power, two Chinese nuclear state corporations, China Guangdong Nuclear Power and State Nuclear Power Technology, are considering taking on the consortium. Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear energy corporation, has also expressed an interest in the UK nuclear market. At this point, it's worth looking at the underlying business ethics of the Russian and Chinese nuclear industries, and questioning the wisdom of their strategic involvement in key UK energy infrastructure. Russia's Rosatom has recently built the hugely controversial nuclear power plant in Iran at Bushehr, and is ready to help Iran build another power generating unit there, despite reports that Iran has installed an underground uranium enrichment facility, potentially paving the way for nuclear weapons development. In Tibet, the Chinese nuclear industry is engaged in a determined effort to secure uranium deposits located in Amdo, where leaching and open pit extraction are reported to have resulted in significant environmental contamination. Regulation of safety oversight mechanisms is relatively weak in the Chinese nuclear industry, and according to a recent Nuclear Materials Security Index report, China ranks 29th among the group of 32 nuclear nations in terms of nuclear security and materials transparency. Although it's to be hoped that greater corporate social responsibility and sensitivity to vulnerable industrial communities is evolving in both Russia and China, it's still troubling to reflect on their respective human rights situations, documented by Amnesty International. A more responsible way forward to this ethically questionable strategy can be found closer to home. Germany uses 20% of all European electricity, and its decision to go nuclear-free by 2020, meeting power and CO2 targets by investing in renewables and energy efficiency, grid network infrastructure, and planning for trans-boundary pumped storage hydroelectricity, with combined heat and power gas and some coal as interim measures, will prove significant for all European energy policy. Germany also views its non-nuclear energy policy as a driver of economic expansion. As Chancellor Angela Merkel says: \"We can achieve a transformation to efficient and renewable energy, with all the opportunities that brings for exports, developing new technologies and jobs.\" • Paul Dorfman is the founder of the Nuclear Consulting Group and a nuclear policy researcher at the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/mar/06/fukushima-nuclear-decommissioning-plant-safety","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-06T17:15:00Z","webTitle":"Fukushima two years on: the largest nuclear decommissioning finally begins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/06/fukushima-nuclear-decommissioning-plant-safety","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/mar/06/fukushima-nuclear-decommissioning-plant-safety","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima two years on: the largest nuclear decommissioning finally begins","bodyText":"Radiation levels in the abandoned communities near Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have fallen 40% in the past year. Inside the wrecked facility, construction workers rush to complete state-of-the-art equipment that will remove dozens of dangerous radioactive nuclides from cooling water. Soon, a steel shield will be driven into the seabed to prevent contamination from the plant from leaking into the Pacific Ocean. Almost two years after a deadly tsunami crashed into the plant, crippling its backup power supply and triggering the world's worst nuclear crisis for a quarter of a century, the gravest danger posed by Fukushima Daiichi has passed. But for all the signs of progress since the Guardian visited the atomic facility a year ago, the biggest, and most complex, nuclear decommissioning operation the industry has ever seen has barely begun. The pipes, cables and other equipment strewn across the plant's grounds this time last year are now functioning components in a complex, technologically fraught mission to cool the crippled reactors, while experts struggle to figure out how to extract the melted nuclear fuel lying deep inside their basements. The three reactors struck by meltdown and hydrogen explosions two years ago were brought to a safe state known as \"cold shutdown\" in December 2011, nine months after the tsunami left almost 20,000 dead or missing along Japan's north-east coast. Now, Japan is about to embark on a clean-up that could cost at least $100bn – on top of the cost of compensating evacuees and decontaminating their abandoned homes. Fukushima Daiichi's manager, Takeshi Takahashi, conceded that decommissioning the plant could take 30 to 40 years. \"Even though we are still faced with a difficult task, we'll keep pushing on with the decommissioning process,\" he told a small group of visiting foreign journalists on Wednesday. \"It will take a long time to complete our work, especially on the three reactors that suffered meltdown, but we'll do our best to keep them stable.\" The clean-up operation will begin at building No 4, where the fuel rods inside survived unscathed after it was hit by the tsunami, then badly damaged by a hydrogen explosion. By the end of this year, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) says it will begin removing fuel assemblies from the reactor building's storage pool and placing them in a nearby cooling pool, where they will remain for four years before being stored in even safer dry casks in a purpose-built facility on higher ground. In total, workers will have to extract more than 11,000 new and used fuel assemblies from seven badly damaged storage pools. Work to remove melted fuel won't begin until 2021, and the entire decommissioning project is expected to take up to 40 years. Managers from firms contracted by Tepco to help decommission the 40-year-old plant say they are confident progress is being made, despite the radiation hazards faced by their employees. Perhaps the most dangerous job on the site has fallen to Hiroshige Kobayashi and his colleagues. As a manager at Kajima Corp, Kobayashi is responsible for clearing and processing the rubble and debris from reactor No 3, where radiation levels easily outstrip those at other parts of the site. On the ocean side of neighbouring reactor No 4, where a meltdown did not occur, Tepco recently measured radiation at 172 microsieverts/hour; but in the same area outside reactor No 3, levels soar to 1,710 microsieverts/hour. By comparison, a chest X-ray is equivalent to 50 microsieverts and a return flight between Tokyo and New York 200 microsieverts, according to the Japan Atomic Energy Agency. The dangers associated with working in highly radioactive areas of Fukushima Daiichi prompted the World Health Organisation (WHO) to warn last week that one-third of the plant's workers face an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer, leukaemia and all solid cancers during their lifetimes. Kobayashi declined to comment on the WHO report, but acknowledged that workers face unprecedented danger from persistently high radiation levels. \"It's a fact that the levels in reactor No 3 are very high, so we are trying to deal with that by using remote control technologies and staying as far away from the reactor as possible,\" he said. Hopes that robots would quickly be able to reach areas of the plant inaccessible to humans suffered a setback when Quince, a $6m robot, lost contact with its operators while monitoring inside one of the reactors in October 2011. \"We're in a situation where we're using technologies we've never experienced before, such as GPS and lasers when we're dealing with the debris,\" Kobayashi said. Although Tepco has managed to insert remote-controlled cameras into the damaged reactors' outer vessels, it is still no closer to gauging the state of the damaged fuel – a prerequisite for removing it. To add to Tepco's troubles, irradiated water is increasing at such a pace that the utility is running out of space for the tanks it needs to store it. Several strong quakes have shaken north-east Japan since 11 March 2011, but Takahashi insisted that the reactor No. 4 building – where 1,500 fuel assemblies stored in a pool on the top floor have drawn concern because of their vulnerability to seismic activity – could withstand an earthquake of similar intensity to the one that destroyed the plant two years ago. Despite those reassurances, Takahashi conceded that the plant has become the focal point of a nuclear crisis whose victims, like the facility itself, are a long way from returning to any semblance of normality. On the drive through the 20-kilometre evacuation zone to Fukushima Daiichi, visitors pass entire villages that remain frozen in time. Half a dozen cars sit abandoned in a supermarket car park, shops and restaurants lie deserted, and thousands of black bags filled with contaminated soil and grass cover fields once used to grow rice, while authorities decide how, and where, to dispose of them. The only movement comes from lorries carrying equipment and building materials, and buses ferrying workers in protective blue and white clothing to and from the plant. Meanwhile, the tens of thousands of residents who once called this forbidding landscape home still have no idea when, or if, they will be able to return. Repeating Tepco's mantra of the past two years, Takahashi apologised \"to the world\" for the \"inconvenience\" caused by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. While he shared his colleagues' optimism over decommissioning, it was tinged – as his surroundings demand – with realism. \"It will be a long time before this power plant becomes a part of history,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2015/jan/25/iter-nuclear-fusion-cadarache-international-thermonuclear-experimental-reactor-steven-cowley","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-25T10:00:05Z","webTitle":"When you wish upon a star: nuclear fusion and the promise of a brighter future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/25/iter-nuclear-fusion-cadarache-international-thermonuclear-experimental-reactor-steven-cowley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2015/jan/25/iter-nuclear-fusion-cadarache-international-thermonuclear-experimental-reactor-steven-cowley","fields":{"headline":"When you wish upon a star: nuclear fusion and the promise of a brighter tomorrow","bodyText":"The countryside of Saint-Paul-lez-Durance in Provence is a serene terrain of thickly wooded hills. On chilly January mornings, the air becomes thick with mist and the sky glows red as the sun pokes up above the horizon at dawn. By mid-morning, that haze is usually gone, leaving behind a bright blue sky with only the faintest wisp of high-altitude cloud. As picture-postcard scenes go, it is as rural and peaceful as it gets. But incongruously nestled among these hills and vineyards, the most sophisticated, expensive machine ever built is slowly taking shape at the local Cadarache nuclear facility. It is a scientific collaboration on a worldwide scale, meant to tackle one of the biggest challenges of the 21st century – with the human population growing every year, how do we continue to make ever more electricity past 2050 (the date that the EU has set for full decarbonisation of power generation) without destroying the environment? The scientists and engineers in Saint-Paul-lez-Durance think the solution is nuclear fusion – they want to recreate a star in a box on Earth. Everything about the project, known as Iter (formerly known as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor), is huge. The main fusion reactor will be built on a flattened area of concrete that has been blasted into the hills at Cadarache and stretches to 60 football pitches. Around 2.5m cubic metres of earth and rubble were excavated from what was originally a small valley that undulated by several hundred metres in parts. That concrete baseplate sits on dozens of pillars containing layers of rubber sandwiched between the mortar and cement – not only do these pillars raise the building above the height of the surrounding countryside (the height was calculated to be above the maximum height that water would flow past if the nearby dam broke), they also create a “seismic isolation pit” that will protect the building from earthquakes. At the centre of the concrete box where the main building will go, you can already see a circle of steel bars that trace the shape of what will become the ring-shaped vacuum vessel, where the fusion reactions will take place. Ready to haul in the huge components over the coming years, four giant cranes are rooted into the site, one of them within the circle itself. When the main building containing the reactor is complete, it will rise 60 metres into the air and reach 10 metres below the ground. When the million or so pieces that make up the Iter machine have been delivered to site and are finally bolted and welded together, the whole thing will weigh around 23,000 tonnes, three times the weight of the Eiffel tower. The entire reactor complex – including the foundations and buildings that will sit in the seismic isolation pit – will weigh 400,000 tonnes, more than the weight of the Empire State Building. Visiting the Iter site, I meet Steven Cowley, who has been working on the theoretical physics of nuclear fusion for three decades and is now chief executive of the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). The last time he saw the site, there was still mud at the bottom of the main pit. Standing over the recently finished concrete platform, he gestures to where the super-hot plasma will one day start burning and fusing atoms. “It’s not ordinary by any stretch of the imagination and when it’s working, you know, it will be one of the great wonders of the world.” Cowley has been waiting for Iter his whole career. His commitment to it is not just driven by a desire to answer scientific questions that have occupied his mind for so many decades, though. “We don’t know where we are going to get our energy from in the second half of this century, and if we don’t get fusion working we are going to be really stuck,” he says. “We have to make [Iter] work. It’s not just because I work in it that I think that: it has to work and all this effort of thousands of people all the way round the world is to make sure that in 2100 you can flick a switch on the wall and have electricity.” Nuclear fusion is different from the more familiar nuclear fission, which involves splitting heavy atoms of uranium to release energy and which is at the heart of all nuclear power stations. The promise of fusion, if scientists can get it to work, is huge – unlimited power without any carbon emissions and very little radioactive waste. The process goes on at the core of every star and the idea that mimicking it could become a source of power on Earth has been around since the years after the second world war. But for many decades fusion has seemed out of reach, requiring materials and an understanding of the chaotic behaviour of hot plasmas that was beyond the technology of the time. However, decades of smaller experiments have led to Iter, the giant project in which fusion scientists have their best possible chance to finally show that this technology could work. Iter has its roots in a summit between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev towards the end of the cold war, in 1985. They agreed on very little but, almost as an afterthought, they mentioned developing fusion as a new source of energy that could benefit all mankind. Europe and Japan joined the Americans and Russians on the tentative project soon after it was conceived and, today, it also includes China, India and South Korea – in total there are 35 countries involved. Its design is centred on heating a cloud of hydrogen gas to 10 times hotter than the core of the sun, some 150m degrees celsius, inside a ring-shaped container called a tokamak, which has superconducting magnets fixed around it like hoops fitted on a circular curtain rail. These magnets create an overlapping set of fields that keep the electrically charged gas inside from touching the sides of the tokamak and therefore losing energy. Building a working tokamak is not straightforward. “The plasma is a bit like a lump of jelly and you are holding it with a magnetic field which is a bit like knitting wool – and imagine holding a lump of jelly with a few pieces of knitting,” says Cowley. The magnets have to be strong and Iter’s design uses superconducting magnets that only work at -269C. Since the earliest designs, several generations of tokamak-based nuclear fusion reactors have proved that it is possible to build and run the technology at increasingly large sizes. The biggest of these is the Joint European Torus (Jet), based at Culham in Oxfordshire and run by the UKAEA. In the early 1990s, experiments there showed it was possible to fuse hydrogen and then release the resulting energy in a controlled way. But it took more energy to fuse atoms at Jet than the scientists got back out at the end – which is useless if you want to use the technology to build a power plant. Iter’s primary goal is to fix that problem by creating what they call a “burning” plasma, something that keeps going without the need for external heating, in the same way that a log fire keeps burning after it has initially been set alight by a match. Its design is a scaled-up version of Jet and the scientists here want to produce 500 megawatts of power, 10 times its predicted input. But scientific challenges are not the only complexities with a mega-project such as Iter. With so many countries involved, so much money and so many engineering contracts, the path to laying even the first building block of this experimental reactor has been far from smooth. The seven partners agreed on Cadarache in 2004 and they signed an agreement two years later, which costed the project at an estimated €5bn to build and a similar amount to run for its 20-year lifetime. The agreement stated that, as hosts for the project, Europe pays 45% of the total cost while the remaining partners split the bill for the rest between them. Countries do not pay funds directly to Iter but rather provide the equivalent value in parts and services to the reactor project. The ratios are important – they were to remain in place even if the cost rose. Which it did: after a design review in 2008 that incorporated several advances in fusion science into the basic design and also took into account the increased cost of steel and concrete, the construction budget rose to €15bn. When the Iter agreement was signed in 2006, the reactor was supposed to begin operations in 2016. With the subsequent redesign and construction delays, the current timetable does not involve a switch-on until 2020 and there will not be a working plasma in the tokamak before around 2022. The all-important fusion reactions are not likely to occur before 2027, more than 20 years after building started. Iter’s director general, the Japanese plasma physicist Osamu Motojima, has been in charge since 2010 and is now in the final months of his tenure. His team came under criticism in 2013 in an assessment carried out by independent consultants, who said the project’s management was inflexible and top-heavy. Motojima says that managing a project to develop a radically new technology with so many political partners was a new experience for the world, and required a “new standard of collaborative culture”. The cost increases, he added, were mainly the result of inflation from the original estimate in 2001 and also the increase in cost of basic building materials. “In general, cost is increasing but that is, I believe, within acceptable levels for stakeholders and the public.” Iter’s governing council has since accepted the thrust of the findings of the assessment report and promised change in how the project is organised, in a bid to keep it on track. Some of the higher costs are perhaps inevitable when you are building new technologies from scratch. In Iter’s case, this is exacerbated by the partners’ wish to build the components of the reactor in facilities all over the world. The task of making the million or so parts of Iter has been distributed among the seven partners. Iter will need 100,000km of superconducting wire for its magnets, for example – enough to wrap around the equator twice – which will be made in China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the US. The magnets are being built in pieces in France and also China. The vacuum chamber, which will contain the hot hydrogen gas, will come in pieces from South Korea and also parts of Europe. Getting all of this to the site in Cadarache is a huge logistical challenge. The giant magnets and vacuum chambers will begin arriving this month along a specially designated 104km road from the nearest Mediterranean port, known as the Iter Itinerary. The pieces will be enormous – the 18 D-shaped coils of wire that will make the main magnets each weigh 360 tonnes, approximately the same as a fully loaded jumbo jet. The heaviest component will weigh 900 tonnes including its transport vehicle and some will be more than 30m long; the tallest will rise four storeys from the road. Part of this distribution of labour is to do with bringing jobs, money and prestige into hi-tech industries within the partner nations. But also, these countries will need their own expertise in building and running fusion power plants if Iter is successful and this form of power takes off. Iter’s job is to show that fusion can be achieved and controlled for sustained periods in the tokamak design. It will not be a power station itself: that is the job of the next generation of fusion reactors, which will be built by countries individually with knowledge gained from the Iter experiments and which are collectively known as “DEMO” projects. China has already started planning the precursor to its DEMO project, a test device called China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor. Construction could start by 2020 and the test plant could be in operation by the mid-2030s, ready to move on to building the first fusion power plants a decade or so after that. Plans to build DEMO power plants are at an earlier stage in Japan and South Korea. There are many hurdles to get over between Iter and a commercial power plant – engineers need to come up with new materials for the walls of the vacuum vessels and the shielding around the plasma, for example. The high-grade steel being used in Iter is good enough to deal with the plasma and the radiation from the relatively small amounts of power (500MW) that will be produced there for a few minutes at a time, but commercial power plants will need much hardier materials in order to deal with the result of a plasma producing three or four times that much power, day in, day out. If all the technical and design refinements in successive experimental reactors go to plan, it is expected that the very first fusion power plants could be producing electricity for the grid by 2045-2050. It has always been a dark joke about nuclear fusion that a commercial power station is 30 years away and that it always will be. But Iter, despite its delays and cost overruns, might finally tip the balance. It’s hard not to be hopeful that, because of the experiment under way in Cadarache, a commercial fusion reactor really is only 30 years off. Indeed, if Iter gets its plasma working and scientists can extract more energy from the burn than they had to put in, it will change the world, says Cowley. “When this machine works I will be here, you know. The end of my career is going to be watching this machine do a fusion burn,” he says. “There are probably, over history, a handful of historic moments where in a flash the future changed. In a flash the future will change with this machine… What this is going to show is that man can make a star.” Fusion facts: how to re-create a star on Earth At the centre of our sun, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms (which are bare protons) are being jostled around under unimaginable pressures. Once in a while, two of them will overcome their mutual repulsion and fuse to form a nucleus of helium, releasing a little energy in the process. It is not a straightforward process, however. Such is the repulsive force between protons that it takes millions of years to fuse two of them, even in the intense conditions within a star. Fusing bare hydrogen is therefore out of the question if you want a power station to mimic the process on Earth, so physicists tend to use two of its isotopes instead, deuterium and tritium, which are heavier versions of hydrogen that contain one and two extra neutrons in their nuclei respectively. Deuterium is abundant in seawater – around one in every 6,000 molecules contains it – and tritium can be made by the fusion reactor itself. By heating the deuterium-tritium mixture to hundreds of millions of degrees celsius inside a ring-shaped vessel, the two elements fuse to form helium, energy and fast-moving neutrons. The neutrons will be absorbed by shielding around the reactor vessel that contains lithium, and this interaction will create more tritium. There is a virtually limitless source of fuel in the world’s oceans to feed future nuclear fusion reactors. And though there are some radioactive waste products that come from the process, they all have short half-lives and will become inert within a few hundred years, as opposed to the thousands of years for which waste from fission reactors stays dangerous. Further, fusion power plants cannot go critical, produce runaway reactions or a meltdown in the way people sometimes worry about with nuclear fission. Like an internal combustion engine, fusion reactors will only burn the fuel put into them. And you only need a very small amount of fuel for each fusion burn in a large power station – tenths of a gram of the mixture will fill up the reactor – since the deuterium-tritium mixture is a million times more energy-dense than petrol.

The laws, rights and traditions requiring protection belong to the Orkney and Shetland Islands. And Orkney and Shetland belong to … well, no one is quite sure. This document, the Declaration of Wyre, is no medieval relic: it was drawn up 30 years ago at a time of planned expansion at Dounreay nuclear power station a few miles south of Kirkwall on the north coast of Scotland. Islanders felt threatened by the presence of this hotbed of radioactive experimentation so close to their fields, fishing grounds and homes. They believed that far-distant London, 700 miles south, was less likely to protect them from careless nuclear expansion than Oslo, a mere 500 miles to the east. So John Goodlad of Shetland and Margaret Flaws of the Orkney island of Wyre led the drafting of this declaration: a clear statement of the northern isles' claim to recognition, subsequently endorsed by the signatures of scores of representative islanders. A supplication to Scandinavian royals might not seem to indicate a fierce assertion of island autonomy. But the declaration of Wyre was in fact a tactical intervention that galvanised the efforts of the Orkney and Shetland movements, two protean organisations – sometimes pressure groups, sometimes political parties – embodying a grassroots desire for the islands' people to have greater control over their own affairs. The drive for island self-governance has grabbed headlines this week in places as unlikely as USA Today and the Guardian, after the launching of a petition on the Scottish parliament's website urging it to hold three separate referendums in Shetland, Orkney, and the Western Isles, asking whether their respective populations would prefer their island group to become an independent country, to stay in Scotland, or (in the event of a yes vote in the referendum in September) leave Scotland and stay with the remainder of the UK. No one here seems sure whether this is a serious suggestion or a move by Better Together supporters to undermine yes momentum by conjuring a vision of a future Scotland fragmenting into ever smaller micro-nations. The latter seems more likely, but if that is the case then it's a dangerous hand for the petitioners to play: they should be careful what they wish for. Because their call is really just the latest iteration of a desire for island autonomy that has bubbled under since at least the Treaty of Breda in 1667 (which was supposed to establish whether Orkney and Shetland were part of the UK, but didn't) and, further back still, the pawning of the two island groups to Scotland by Norway in 1468 and 1469 (as security against a marriage dowry between a Norwegian princess and a Scottish king). If the border between Scotland and England deserved the name Debatable Lands for centuries, the same is true for Orkney and Shetland: these are the Debatable Islands. In 1984, the UK government's Montgomery committee concluded not only that \"opportunities should be taken whenever possible to consolidate, develop and extend the powers of island councils\", but, more remarkably, \"acts of parliament should include a position to vary the application to the islands areas\". And while the petitioners were posting on the Scottish government's website, an undoubtedly serious and much more realisable political move was well under way, built on Montgomery's principles. In June 2013, the councils of Orkney, Shetland and Na h-Eileanan Siar (the Western Isles) launched the Our Islands, Our Future campaign, an ambitious, radical and coherent plan for greater powers to be invested in the islands, supporting them in overcoming their special difficulties and maximizing the reaping of their special potential. Notably, the campaign has earned respect and endorsement from both the London and Edinburgh administrations. \"The law of peripheral neglect,\" wrote Leopold Kohr, \"states that concern for remote districts diminishes with the square of the distance from the seat of power.\" The square of the distance from Edinburgh to Orkney is much smaller than the one from London, but it's still considerable. And many islanders are nervous about Holyrood noticing them: at least London tends to leave us alone, they say. As one north isles man put it to me: \"The choice at the referendum in September is between being ignored by London and discriminated against by Edinburgh.\" The SNP government has failed to make the most of its positive contributions to the northern isles (£60m for new schools in Orkney, for instance) while allowing its opponents to capitalise on its poorer decisions (different subsidies for travel to different island groups, with the divide appearing to match whether or not the islands vote SNP). The persistence of the notion of greater island autonomy may be more important than who's in power in Edinburgh or London; after all, the SNP is in government now, but that won't last forever – especially if there's a Yes vote in September and all the parties have to reshape themselves to succeed in the new landscape created by the people of Scotland. From the headline-grabbing but mischievous to the bureaucratic but revolutionary, political, cultural, linguistic and even legal expressions of autonomy keep piling up: the islands of Scotland remain stubbornly different from the rest of the UK (and, for that matter, from the rest of Scotland). As long-time isles MP and Liberal grandee Jo Grimond wrote: \"Devolution suggests that power is centred at the top, that is, in Westminster, and some of it has to be handed down. But in the view of myself and many other people, power inheres in the people themselves and their basic communities.\" So despite what the Declaration of Wyre says, it is clear who the islands of Orkney and Shetland belong to. They belong to the people who live here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2013/jun/04/decarbonisation-target-defeated-energy-bill-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-04T16:01:43Z","webTitle":"Decarbonisation target narrowly defeated in Commons energy bill vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/04/decarbonisation-target-defeated-energy-bill-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jun/04/decarbonisation-target-defeated-energy-bill-vote","fields":{"headline":"Decarbonisation target narrowly defeated in Commons energy bill vote","bodyText":"A bid to include a target to decarbonise the UK's electricity generation by 2030 was narrowly defeated in the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon, to the dismay of green campaigners and businesses that had backed the goal as a way of stimulating investment in renewables and low-carbon energy. The amendment to the energy bill, proposed by the former Tory minister Tim Yeo, was voted down by 290 votes to 267, though several Tories and Lib Dems backed the measure against the coalition's line. It was one of the narrowest victories for the government in a whipped vote during this parliament. Under the amendment, electricity generators would have had to use more renewables, carbon capture and storage and nuclear power to reduce to nearly zero their carbon production by 2030. The measure had the backing of dozens of businesses, green campaigners and industry associations. Several potential rebels were persuaded by a promise by the coalition to allow the secretary of state to consider a 2030 decarbonisation target in 2016. But before then, the government will review the fourth carbon budget, which sets out how much carbon dioxide the UK can produce each year to 2027. David Cameron, under pressure from greens, agreed early in the coalition to set a stiff carbon budget that would require roughly halving the UK's carbon output by the late 2020s. However, he bowed to George Osborne, the chancellor, who opposes green regulation, in allowing a review of that target next year, in 2014. The fight over the fourth carbon budget looks set to be intense, as the close nature of Tuesday's vote shows. Many Tories back Osborne's call for a new \"dash for gas\", which they say will be cheaper than renewable power, and are concerned that the UK is taking on more than its share of emissions cuts. The Committee on Climate Change recently produced a report rebutting those arguments, and showing that the UK could benefit from cheaper energy if more renewable generation is built sooner rather than later. Yeo, who is chairman of the influential energy and climate change select committee, said the defeat of his amendment was a blow to clean energy supporters. \"The commons has missed an opportunity today to provide more clarity for investors on the future direction of energy policy. Unfortunately this could mean that urgently needed investment in our energy infrastructure will be slower and the risk of a capacity crisis [including electricity shortages] greater. The continuing uncertainty that will result increases the perceived risk of investment and will therefore raise capital costs, meaning that consumers may ultimately pay more for the new power plants that need to be built.\" The energy bill will now move to the House of Lords, where there will be a further chance to bring forward a decarbonisation target. Yeo said that the large number of votes in favour of the amendment should encourage many peers to support it. Andy Atkins, executive director of Friends of the Earth, slammed Liberal Democrats for siding with the Tories - many of whom stridently oppose green power - instead of taking an environmental stance. He said: \"The Liberal Democrat leadership's green credibility has been left in tatters after siding with the Conservatives to back a headlong dash for gas – this would send fuel bills rocketing and jobs overseas, and punch a gaping hole in our climate targets. With significant numbers of MPs defying the party whip to join the opposition by voting for clean power, this issue will not go away.\" The energy bill – a complex piece of legislation that has been nearly three years in the making – will determine the shape of the UK's electricity generation for decades to come, as investors will make decisions in the next few years on vital infrastructure that will still be operating more than 30 years from now. At the centre of the bill is a major overhaul of the UK's energy subsidies, whereby existing support mechanisms that guarantee a premium for renewable generation will be replaced by a system of \"contracts for difference\" and a \"capacity market\", under which generators will enter into long-term contracts to produce quantities of energy for a price that is likely to be above standard wholesale prices. Crucial to the working of this new system will be the \"strike price\" at which renewable and nuclear power generators are guaranteed a return for their production. Those strike prices have yet to be set - they were supposed to be published last year, but have been severely delayed by a government stand-off with the nuclear industry. EDF, the French nuclear generator that is expected to build the first new nuclear power station in the UK for decades, has demanded a higher price than ministers were prepared to concede. The strike prices may come as soon as the end of this month, or may be delayed until September. Critics have said that the new system is overly complex, but the government has said it will encourage investment. Investment in the UK's renewable energy has fallen to a seven-year low, according to recent research by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, as investors have been spooked by the contradictory messages coming from government. Many on the right of the Conservative party have become more vociferous in their opposition to alternative energy, and more outspoken in voicing doubts over climate change science."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/oct/14/iran-ready-nuclear-programme-geneva-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-14T17:28:18Z","webTitle":"Iran ready to deal on nuclear programme at Geneva talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/14/iran-ready-nuclear-programme-geneva-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/oct/14/iran-ready-nuclear-programme-geneva-talks","fields":{"headline":"Iran ready to deal on nuclear programme at Geneva talks","bodyText":"Iran's negotiators are expected to offer restrictions on its nuclear programme in return for at least a partial lifting of sanctions, at a new round of talks starting in Geneva on Tuesday, diplomats said. The complexity of the proposals means a completed deal is unlikely at the end of two days of negotiations, as there will remain significant gaps between the Iranian and western negotiating positions, but diplomats pointed to a new level of engagement not seen for several years. The Iranian foreign minister and lead negotiator, Mohammad Javad Zarif, posted a message on his Facebook account saying the Geneva talks were \"the start of a difficult and relatively time-consuming way forward\". He said: \"I am hopeful that by Wednesday we can reach agreement on a road map to find a path towards resolution. But even with the goodwill of the other side, to reach agreement on details and start implementation will likely require another meeting at ministerial level.\" The Iranian road map for the talks was described in vague terms on Friday by Zarif's deputy, Abbas Araqchi, who said Tehran would negotiate \"the form, amount, and various levels of [uranium] enrichment\" but would not agree to shipping enriched uranium out of the country. Elements of the plan were floated in more detail during a visit to the UN in New York last month by Zarif and the newly-elected president, Hassan Rouhani, the Guardian has learned. Iranian officials said Tehran would be prepared to limit its enrichment programme to two facilities, possibility both at Natanz, suggesting a readiness to suspend enrichment at a sensitive underground site at Fordow. Iran is also prepared to suspend production of 20%-enriched uranium – another major concern for the international community as it is relatively straightforward to convert it into 90% weapons grade material. Tehran will not agree to surrendering its existing stockpile of the 20% medium-enriched uranium, currently about 190kg, but compromises are possible that would make it less of a proliferation concern. It could be kept under international monitoring in a remote corner of the country, or it could be turned into reactor fuel, a form which is harder to enrich further. Iran is also prepared to negotiate on the number of centrifuges it uses to make 3.5% enriched uranium, suitable for fuel for nuclear power stations, and on how much each centrifuge makes. Iranian officials have pointed out that, although new model centrifuges, called IR-2M, have been installed, they are not yet being fed with uranium gas for enrichment, and they pointed to that as an example of how the enrichment programme could be calibrated by international agreement. Furthermore, the Iranians suggested that work on a heavy-water reactor at Arak, which would produce plutonium when commissioned, had been delayed since Rouhani's election and could be put off further if an interim deal was reached. Tehran has also revived a longstanding proposal of forming a consortium with other countries to enrich uranium in Iran, as a means of reassuring the international community it would not be diverted for weapons purposes. In return, Iran would expect significant sanctions relief, and recognition that it had the right in principle to enrich uranium. If the elements floated in New York are set out in Zarif's road map, it would represent the most substantive Iranian offer in a decade. However there would still be significant points of difference with the six nations represented at the Geneva talks: the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, chaired by the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton. The group has demanded the underground facility at Fordow be closed down entirely as part of a confidence-building deal. Iran is likely to accept suspension of enrichment there but not permanent closure. Similarly, western powers had called for the transfer of the total stock of 20% enriched uranium out of the country, and it is unclear whether its conversion to reactor fuel or warehousing inside Iran would satisfy Washington and its allies. The US is also reluctant to declare Iran's right to enrich uranium openly as early in the process as Tehran would like, fearing it would set a precedent for many other nations to start building centrifuge plants of their own, multiplying the risk of global nuclear proliferation. Lastly, there is a gaping divide between the scale of sanctions relief Iran is demanding, involving the lifting of oil and financial embargoes, and the much more limited concessions offered by the west, covering aircraft parts, gold and petrochemical exports. Iran observers, however, are hopeful that creative diplomacy at Geneva can help close some of those gaps. \"The Iranians are confident. They have a game plan and they are looking to execute that plan,\" said Jim Walsh, an expert on the Iranian nuclear programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"They are aware of the political sensitivities in the US. They get it, but they have sensitivities of their own and their clock is ticking for them to produce some results. They are ready for a small deal. Not a grand bargain, but a small deal. Our concern on the American side is do we have our act together. I still don't have the answer to that question.\" The Obama administration's room for negotiation is limited by what Congress would accept which in turn is influenced partly by Israel's position. Israel has warned of the dangers of the P5+1 talks in Geneva producing a \"bad agreement\" along the lines of those signed with North Korea, which did not prevent Pyongyang developing nuclear weapons. As part of the diplomatic and media offensive launched by the Israeli government ahead of this week's talks in Geneva, intelligence and strategic affairs minister Yuval Steinitz told foreign journalists: \"We have to learn from history, and the mistakes of history, and be very clear that not every agreement is a genuine political achievement.\" He stressed that Israel had not \"closed the door to a diplomatic solution\" to the Iranian nuclear issue, \"on condition that it is a satisfactory solution\". \"We do hope this process will succeed, that there will be a satisfactory diplomatic solution. We hope that we will not repeat the terrible mistakes of North Korea. This is our hope and we should all do our best to ensure that Geneva 2013 will not become Munich 1938,\" he said, referring to the pre-second world war agreement regarded as an act of appeasement by European powers to Nazi Germany. In contrast to the agreements made with North Korea, the minister cited Libya as a successful model. \"This agreement was about dismantling nuclear capacity, destroying centrifuges and giving up enrichment facilities,\" he said. In contrast to previous statements made by Israeli leaders, Steinitz played down the necessity of a credible military threat against Iran, instead warning against the premature lifting of economic sanctions. \"The economic pressure [on Iran] is very significant. The greater the pressure, the greater the chance of diplomacy to succeed. The Iranians are coming to the table because of severe economic pressure.\" Sanctions must not be eased before a final satisfactory solution, he added. \"A credible military threat would increase the chances of success but maybe you can succeed without that.\" The \"rational and logical\" outcome of the Geneva talks was to allow Iran to produce nuclear power for civilian use, using fuel bought from abroad, as Canada, South Africa, Sweden and other countries do, he said. \"This is a win-win situation – Iran gets what it says it wants, and the rest of the world is confident they are not producing nuclear weapons.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/nov/06/uk-shipbuilding-industry-bae-portsmouth","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-06T12:23:14Z","webTitle":"The decline of the UK shipbuilding industry was not inevitable | Dan Milmo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/06/uk-shipbuilding-industry-bae-portsmouth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/nov/06/uk-shipbuilding-industry-bae-portsmouth","fields":{"headline":"The decline of the UK shipbuilding industry was not inevitable","bodyText":"The ending of more than 500 years of naval shipbuilding in Portsmouth will inevitably lead to laments about Britain's industrial decline. This was an industry that at its peak built great ships such as the Queen Mary and HMS Dreadnought, constructed in Glasgow and Portsmouth respectively in the early 20th century. The boom lasted well beyond the second world war. According to consultancy IHS, 134 vessels – 1.47m gross tonnes of shipping – were produced in the UK in 1976. But competition from Japan, South Korea and now China has taken its toll, with the industry producing just four ships in 2011. Even Royal Navy tankers are being built in the vast shipyards of South Korea now. Conversations with veteran industrialists about the state of shipbuilding today do not yield whimsical reminiscence of the good old days. Instead they produce regrets that tough commercial decisions – of the kind that saw France and Germany aggressively pursue markets such as nuclear power or premium cars – were not made in Britain in the 70s and 80s. Sir John Parker, the former chief executive of Harland and Wolff, the much-diminished Belfast shipbuilder, said the industry missed an opportunity in the Thatcher era. \"One of my big industrial disappointments or even failures is that I failed to persuade the government of the day that there was a big future in building cruise ships. Whoever used run-of-the-mill bulk carriers or tankers drifted to the lowest-cost country. So how you survived in higher-cost countries was more sophisticated ships like cruise ships. I saw that there was going to be a lot of growth in cruise ship building so we demonstrated that this was a real growth industry. And nearly 25 years on, those forecasts would have underestimated the demand.\" Thus the industry drifted to the east. A shipbuilding industry remains in the UK, although it will be even smaller in the wake of Portsmouth and the winnowing down of what remains on the Clyde. According to the UK Marine Industries Alliance, the wider UK sector employs nearly 90,000 people with a turnover of nearly £10bn. Some of it is envied abroad. Dorset-based Sunseeker, a maker of luxury yachts, was bought for £320m by China's second richest man in June. And these are the niches that the industry occupies: bulge-bracket naval work that has just been dealt a ruinous blow; and specialist work like Sunseeker. Parker's regret is that the UK did not spot the big opportunities in the 80s and, backed by government support, claim them for its own. This applies to every British industrial sector under Thatcher, Major and Blair. It is also worth being hard-nosed about Portsmouth, Scotstoun and Govan. These yards have produced state-of-the-art work in the HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales aircraft carriers and the manufacturing in their cavernous yards is an impressive site to behold. But these were sites dependent on one buyer: the British taxpayer. So when the £5.4bn carrier programme ended, job cuts were inevitable. This should be borne in mind if you walk down the Clyde, towards Dumbarton, from Glasgow's Riverside Museum and its collection of shipbuilding memorabilia. The walk encompasses the still-active Scotstoun plant and the derelict, undeveloped sites that once surrounded it, including the John Brown yard that launched the Queen Mary. It would have been a different sight if successive governments had guided the shipbuilding industry to a sustainable future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2014/jun/03/guardian-weekly-letters-6-june","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-03T12:59:00Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 6 June 2014","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/jun/03/guardian-weekly-letters-6-june","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2014/jun/03/guardian-weekly-letters-6-june","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 6 June 2014","bodyText":"Freedom and the monarchy The analysis of Thai politics in your leader (Waiting for democracy, 30 May) is, as far as it goes, spot on. But it does not go far enough. While noting the incomplete democratic revolution of 1932 and the place of the royal court in the \"old\" establishment democratically overthrown by Thaksin Shinawatra, it underplays the decades-long campaign by the king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, to recoup power for the monarchy. Paul M Handley (in The King Never Smiles: A Biography of Thailand's Bhumibol Adulyadej) observed: \"[r]ather than accepting his position as simply a benign cultural object like the modern Japanese or British monarchs, Bhumibol made himself a full-fledged, dominant political actor\". Reviewing Handley's book for the New York Review of Books, Ian Buruma commented: \"Bhumibol has never had much time for elected politicians, whom he tends to denigrate as selfish, venal and divisive. Tough military men and loyal bureaucrats are more congenial to his vision of unity, order and harmony under the wise, selfless, and virtuous monarch\". Buruma is too kind. A revanchist monarchy is the central impediment to democracy in Thailand. It is probably too much to expect a religious people like the Thais to accept Denis Diderot's advice that \"Men will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest.\" But there will be no democracy in Thailand until the monarchy is abolished. Geoff Mullen Sydney, Australia The alienation of children Alex Renton's indictment of prep and public boarding school (23 May) will have rung bells for a lot of old inmates. And (unlike your Guardian Weekly headline, The abusers could still be teaching) he's wise not to make too much of the physical cruelty and sexual abuse entailed. What does more damage is the routine alienation of young children from family and community, and the systematic substitution of formal hierarchy, models and discipline for the intimate interaction of home life. For working-class families, to have a child taken into care has been a proof of failure; for certain middle-class families, it's still proof of success, and a prudent investment in future success – however partial – as emotion and energy are diverted to competitive performance. I blame the middle-class parents. If not my own, then theirs who brought them up unable or unwilling to care for us, or trust any common humanity beyond their class. I can't say I suffered much at school, but by the end of each school holiday I felt the cold and darkness creeping in. When the school train pulled away, the tears may have been in my parents' eyes, not mine. Not every painful separation is avoidable. We all know about cutting the cord. But who asks what happens at the other end of the cord, inside the baby? Could that be where a lot of later emotion comes home to roost, as subsequent partings and losses flit back to the old grand central station, onetime source of everything? Greg Wilkinson Swansea, UK Schools of economists I enjoyed Aditya Chakrabortty's article on the state of university economics departments (16 May). I am encouraged to hear that current students are demanding that they be taught rather than indoctrinated. Perhaps the problem is that these economics schools are being considered in the wrong light. As any liberal arts professor might suggest, let's start by \"unpacking\" the institution's title: while a \"school of economics\" is clearly economic for the university, the \"school\" part has obviously been read in the wrong context. Instead of being a place of learning and open debate, please think of these institutions instead as large groups of cold-blooded vertebrates moving in unison to find food and protect themselves from perceived threats. This type of \"school\" is better used for studying the biology of complex human systems or as economics case studies themselves – how they are used by universities to collect revenue or \"food\" from students, alumni and corporate partners, and how their policies move according to shifting currents rather than better understanding. Only rarely should these \"schools\" be thought of as a part of a university's attempts to be a source of enlightenment. Dave Scott Toronto, Canada • Aditya Chakraborrty's statement that \"mainstream economists are liberal in theory but can be [sic] authoritarian in practice\", just misses the crux of the issue: namely, the impact of peer review. That practice may well be beneficial in physics or chemistry but, in other disciplines, it is the weapon by which a senior tenured faculty ensures that young aspirants cannot rock the academic boat – even where the ship is run by fools! Philip Stigger Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada The death of the novel Yet another dire prediction that books, especially novels, are doomed (23 May). And yet another reference to Marshall McLuhan, who apparently predicted the advent of the books' nemesis, the internet, as the inevitable result of the broadcast technology that existed in his time. In any case, Will Self laments the possible loss of his livelihood as a novelist, and predicts that students expecting to follow in his footsteps will be swallowed whole into the swamp of unread theses, coming up for air only to teach others like themselves who will face the same fate. Such, as Self says, is the inevitable follow-up to \"a self-perpetuating and self-financing literary set-aside scheme to accommodate writers who can no longer make a living from their work\". Self ignores the fact that there are vast numbers of non-writers who still buy novels, and who consider it one of life's greatest pleasures to lounge comfortably with a good hardcover book. I have no idea whether the invention of the telephone was considered the work of the devil, but it made us more conversant. By the same token, books in any form are living messages from writers to whom we can still respond. Richard Orlando Westmount, Quebec, Canada The horrors of coal While I agree with Simon Jenkins (23 May) that coal power must go, I think he could do with having a better look at the energy sector. Oil, gas and nuclear all receive (very) large subsidy, and add to the problem of climate change. The renewable issue is mostly with their intermittent nature. The solution is clearly development of distributed-energy storage, which would enable us to avoid the use of coal as the back-up power source. I find the idea of using neighbourhood-scale hydrogen power very compelling – the hydrogen can be produced by renewable energy and then used to fill the gaps from the renewable supply. The answer to the climate problem is going to need new ideas to fix it – relying on slightly different mixes of old ones is sure to fail. Rohan Chadwick Bristol, UK • I largely agree with Simon Jenkins's prescription to focus more on gas and nuclear power to reduce coal use. Yet, in discounting solar and wind power, he missed the big picture. While it is true that coal dependency is rising in Germany and electricity is costly due to high use of solar and wind power, the investment made in creating a market for these technologies has brought down costs dramatically over the past 10 years – with an eight-fold reduction for solar. The rest of the world benefits. Solar and wind power need to be part of the global solution to climate change. Phil Napier-Moore Bangkok, Thailand Briefly • It shouldn't surprise your writer that since the US has interfered with elected governments in Egypt and Ukraine, the Iranians think they may be next (23 May). They remember that their elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, was overthrown in 1953 in a coup that the US bragged about. In the 1980s, the US contributed money, weapons and intelligence toward invading Iraq during a war that cost hundreds of thousands of casualties. Why wouldn't they be cautious? Patricia Clarke Toronto, Canada • Many Canadians would agree with Saeed Kamali Dehghan on Why Canada is so wrong about Iran (23 May) – but again, please, it's the Stephen Harper government, not \"Canada\".

Both were nominated for Oscars. Salaam Cinema, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, 1995 For this film, Mohsen Makhmalbaf announces a casting call: thousands of people turn up and there’s a riot to get in. Each participant is channelling their worries and hopes into the desire to be in a film. He interacts with them in this dictatorial way, which makes the film ultimately about power and authority. He demands that people cry on command. One woman becomes so frustrated that she does start to cry, so he says OK, you’ve made it. And she’s so happy, but then there’s the disappointment as she realises this was her moment on screen. She thought there’d be a script and a real film to make afterwards. It’s a devastating, beautiful film. Close Up, Abbas Kiarostami, 1990 A man pretends to be Mohsen Makhmalbaf, the director of Salaam Cinema. He insinuates himself into a family’s life out of loneliness, to make friends. At one point the family realise he’s not really the director and have him arrested. The film follows this man’s trial in an Iranian court, and then the real Mohsen Makhmalbaf meets the man and takes him to the family. The impostor’s fragility ultimately embodies what it means to be poor and struggling in life, and through that you feel how sad it is that we live in a world where people are measured by wealth and power, and the cruelty that any human being could ever feel insignificant. Gates of Heaven, Errol Morris, 1978 This was Errol Morris’s first film. He was taking his time with it so Werner Herzog promised “If you finish this film I will eat my shoe,” which he did. It’s about two families in California who run pet cemeteries, and it looks at humans’ relationships to their pets. It’s an odd mystery, a pet. We eat animals, we use them for labour, but then we keep them in our home as objects upon which we project love that we maybe lack elsewhere. Morris has these carefully crafted tableaux: there’s one continuous shot where a woman has a 15-minute lament, complaining about aspects of her life, and that’s where the film becomes something altogether greater and more mysterious. Loss Is to Be Expected, Ulrich Seidl, 1992 This was made shortly after the fall of communism in eastern Europe and it looks at two communities on either side of the Czech-Austrian border. There’s an elderly man in Austria looking for a new wife, and he meets a lone single woman on the Czech side of the border. There are these amazing scenes where they go on a date to a funfair and then to a sex museum. She’s much more sexually comfortable than he is, which is a source of incredible comedy. But it’s about desire and love and the fulfilling of our quotidian needs and the necessary, wilful blindness towards our deeper needs because ultimately, to contemplate those needs is to contemplate our own mortality. The Hour of the Furnaces, Octavia Getino and Fernando e Solanas, 1968 This is a furious, angry film about neocolonialism in Argentina, and it’s the most devastating look at colonialism I’ve seen in nonfiction films. The sections about Argentina’s oligarchy, and the exploitation on which they thrived, are so poetically rendered that you relate to the horror of dictatorship purely through your emotions. It was made secretly and was screened at illegal opposition meetings, in defiance of the authoritarian rule. People were arrested for screening it. I imagine that seeing it at the time you would come out feeling like you’d have to do something about the situation. There are sections of The Act of Killing where I surely had this film in the back of my head. KB Lucy Walker: ‘The Up series showed me what the medium was capable of’ British director Lucy Walker has been Oscar-nominated twice, for Waste Land (2010) and The Tsunami and the Cherry Blossom (2011). She is currently working on a follow-up to Buena Vista Social Club. Hoop Dreams, Steve James, 1994 Hoop Dreams follows two very talented African American boys in Chicago who get a basketball scholarship to go to a prestigious, predominantly white high school. It follows them for five years and it’s a spectacular example of a longitudinal documentary where you get to glimpse the machinery of life. You get a real sense of time unfolding and the big forces that act on us. The twists and turns are subtle, nothing much happens, and yet it feels incredibly dramatic and compelling because it’s so well crafted and the characters are so beautifully rendered. I watched it repeatedly when I was making my first film, Devil’s Playground, because it follows young people through this pivotal period in their lives, and I was trying to understand how you could get so much narrative, emotion and character into a film. There’s a scene where the mum is icing a birthday cake for her son’s 16th birthday. It’s an interview, in the sense that the film-maker is asking her questions and she’s talking to camera, but it doesn’t feel like one, it’s so much more cinematic and compelling and the activity is so perfect. Streetwise, Martin Bell, 1984 This film had its beginnings in a photojournalism assignment for Life magazine by the photographer Mary Ellen Mark about a group of street kids living in Seattle. She persuaded her husband, Martin Bell, to make a film about them. It’s just so intimate that it’s hard to believe the film-maker is actually in the room with these kids. It’s like he’s put on a cloak of invisibility. I could have chosen any number of cinema vérité masterpieces but for some reason this moves me. I’ve made quite a few films with young people and it’s fascinating because the plot of their lives is so close to the surface: one conversation can change the course of your life when you’re young in a way that is rare when you’re older – and you can capture that nano-second when the course of a life’s direction is altered. When you put a camera and a film crew into a room, the observer’s paradox is almost always true – you can’t capture life because you’re in the way of it. But these kids seem unaware of the camera and they’re behaving in a way that feels like life unfolding. The filmmaker is so present with them, you can’t help but understand what they’re going through, and to understand is to feel empathy and to want to help. The Five Obstructions, Lars von Trier and Jørgen Leth, 2003 In this underrated film the iconoclastic Danish director Lars von Trier challenges experimental film-maker Jørgen Leth to remake one of his earlier films, The Perfect Human, five times, each time with a different creative constraint. The first “obstruction” imposed by von Trier, for example, was that the film had to be made in Cuba, using shots of no more than 12 frames. Another was that it had to be made as a cartoon. It’s basically these two creative egos going up against each other and it gives a fascinating insight into the film-making process, what goes on in a director’s head and how you cope with stress and constraint and challenge. It’s delicious and playful and there’s never a dull moment watching these two maestros needling each other. The Gleaners and I, Agnès Varda, 2000 This film was made during the early days of the hand-held digital camera, when for the first time you could capture something high-quality enough to show on a big screen on a camera that would fit in your handbag. It’s an essay about the people who pick through other people’s leftovers, whether it be the remains of the harvest in the countryside, or in cities. It’s very casual, but Varda is so astute and the quality of the film-making is such that it becomes something very beautiful, a meditation on life. We’re having this golden age of documentary right now and it’s being driven by technology. In the past you would need to write a script first because the editing process was so laborious but now you can shoot a whole bunch of stuff and capture life in a way that you couldn’t before and this film, shot by a 72-year-old woman using a very low-key format, shows you just what level of artistry is possible. Up series, Michael Apted, 1964 I’m fascinated by longitudinal film-making and this series, which has followed the lives of 14 British children since 1964, when they were seven years old, showed me what the medium was capable of. This series is head and shoulders above any other attempt to record dramatically a whole human life. And because it’s a whole group of people, you learn not just about the individual but also about the system in which they’re living. I can’t think of any other artefact in our culture that can tell us so much about Britain in our lifetime and how society is evolving as this body of work. It’s illuminating and fascinating and it’s one of the things that inspired me to do the work that I do. JO’C Alex Gibney: ‘Fake home movies don’t bother me – you might as well object to dreams’ Alex Gibney’s award-winning films include Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room (2005), Taxi to the Dark Side (2007) and Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God (2012). Last year he released documentaries on Scientology and Steve Jobs. He says: “I don’t believe in ‘five best films’. But I do believe in influential films. These are five of mine.” Night and Fog, Alain Resnais, 1955 What really impressed me about this film was its concision. It’s about the Holocaust, but it has a simple and horrible beauty to it, because it describes the terrifying nature of the Holocaust through a powerful series of images and a narration that was specific, naming the collections of items of the prisoners and survivors. It’s the cruel poetry of detail that is so heartbreaking: the handles of the ovens, the fingernail scrapings on the ceilings of the cells. We see piles of combs, shaving brushes, shoes and a vast mountain of human hair. It took something so horrible but found a way to go to the heart of the matter through simple details. Gimme Shelter , Albert and David Maysles, Charlotte Zwerin 1970 Here you see the Rolling Stones on tour singing about sympathy for the devil, but their posturing about satanism blows back at them at the Altamont music festival. It’s structured like a detective story: it starts with a murder – a Hell’s Angel stabs somebody who seems to have a gun in the audience – and then you go back in time. Maybe one of the most powerful scenes is of the Stones listening to a playback of Wild Horses in the studio. It’s stunning in its simplicity. That film went way beyond a concert show; it celebrates music but it’s really about a moment in time and how dark forces get unleashed. It’s powerful both in its observation and its analysis, which is a rare combination. When We Were Kings , Leon Gast, 1996 This is maybe the greatest sport film ever made. It has wonderful cinema vérité footage of the “Rumble in the Jungle”, the famous 1974 fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. Gast has the most magnificent material, particularly in Muhammad Ali on a run, dancing, gooning for the camera, at his most charismatic. And then the brooding figure of George Foreman. But Gast wasn’t able to put that footage together, and in comes Taylor Hackford, shoots some interviews with people who were there, notably George Plimpton and Norman Mailer, and through their recollection you also have a sense of analysis and understanding rather than mere observation. So it’s combining those two things in the film that really is magnificent. Stories We Tell, Sarah Polley, 2012 This is a detective story that’s very much in the first person. It’s about identity, trying to understand your childhood, and ultimately paternity. Sarah Polley is digging back into the relationship between her mother and father, who she discovers isn’t her biological father. In some quarters she was criticised for using a series of fictional home movies that she manufactured, but it didn’t bother me at all – they might as well object to dreams and memories, because those are everyday recreations. The trick is finding the poetry in them. It’s a very powerful film about memory and exploration and love, because she comes to appreciate her adoptive father in a way she might not otherwise have done. Waltz With Bashir , Ari Folman, 2008 Part of the small but growing category of the animated documentary, Waltz With Bashir is really a film about repressed memory, and the recollection of Israeli soldiers trying to understand why they’re having these nightmares. The idea of using animation to convey what is mostly going on inside their heads, in their imaginations, is such a powerful one. It doesn’t become clear until almost the end that the soldiers all took part in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camp massacre in Lebanon in 1982. And the very end of the film includes just the slightest bit of real footage: a woman wailing in the wake of that massacre. It really is one of the most poignant films about the trauma of war. KB Kim Longinotto: ‘All the good TV documentaries are on the BBC at the moment’ British film-maker Kim Longinotto tackles themes such as female genital mutilation (The Day I Will Never Forget) and women fighting abuse (Sisters in Law). Her most recent film, Dreamcatcher, is on Chicago women trying to leave the sex industry. Sherman’s March, Ross McElwee, 1986 I saw this at film school, then watched it again at a festival a couple of years ago and thought it was so charming, so good. It has a very simple premise. The director is meant to be making a film about General Sherman’s march through Georgia during the American civil war, but he falls out of love with the idea. Instead, the film becomes about his attempts to find a girlfriend, shot as a kind of video diary – an approach that was completely new at the time. It’s so candid and affectionate and lovely, and everyone at the festival loved it. Not many films bear rewatching, but this one does. Tales of the Grim Sleeper, Nick Broomfield, 21 Nick Broomfield has become much more serious and political in recent years and this is a difficult and committed film. It’s about a man who was arrested in 2010 for killing as many as 100 prostitutes in Los Angeles over a period of 25 years. What’s extraordinary is how he managed to get away with it for so long – the police didn’t pursue because his victims were mostly black prostitutes. It’s a very timely film, in terms of Black Lives Matter and police abuses in the US, and I thought he got it just right. It’s also a really good crime story. Solar Mamas, Jehane Noujaim and Mona Eldaief, 2012 This is a film about Bedouin women trying to get solar energy in their village in Jordan. It follows one woman travelling to a college in India to become a solar engineer. I like it because it’s not saying, “Oh, look at these poor women.” Instead, it shows women actively changing their lives and I found that very inspiring. So many documentaries tell you what to think. This one doesn’t – it puts you straight into the story and you get to know the characters just by watching them. It was part of a very good BBC series on poverty. That’s where all the good TV documentaries are at the moment: on the BBC. Virunga, Orlando von Einsiedel, 2014 I watched this in the cinema, which was good because it’s very beautifully filmed – a real spectacle. It’s set in a reserve in the Congo, which is home to the last mountain gorillas on earth and it follows the people who are trying to save them, as well as the corrupt people trying to get the land to drill oil. There’s a moment when the people in a neighbouring village are attacked. It was filmed so well, I don’t know how they did it. You’re right in the thick of it and you feel so angry, because you know it all comes down to corruption and greed. Five Broken Cameras, Emad Burnat, Guy Davidi, 2011 This is about a Palestinian man who films the destruction of his village’s olive groves by the Israeli army. His cameras keep getting broken by the Israelis, hence the title, but he just kept filming. I think he was feeling: “There’s an incredible wrong being done to my people, I’m going to film it, even if I die doing it.” Then he linked up with an Israeli film-maker, who edited the footage. I remember people saying he shouldn’t have worked with an Israeli, but I thought it was so great that they came together and made something very powerful which showed us what is really going on in Palestine. KF James Marsh: ‘In my view there should be no boundaries to film-making’ James Marsh is a British film-maker, best known for the Oscar-winning documentary Man on Wire (2008) and the acclaimed Stephen Hawking biopic, The Theory of Everything. Man with a Movie Camera, Dziga Vertov, 1929 This was the first truly subversive, playful documentary. It’s notionally a day in the life of a city in the Soviet Union and so it has, on a purely sociological/historical level, great value. But what it does beyond that is to show you the means of production: the filming, the cutting room, the editing – all the things that are going into the making of this film. It’s way before its time, the Tristram Shandy of documentaries, if you like. It’s so inventive and it has techniques that, 87 years later, still look pretty revolutionary: the freeze frames and slow motion. It’s just full of inventive and brilliant formal ideas as well as being a very beautiful film to watch. And it’s informative too, showing us the Soviet Union in a halcyon period before Stalin’s terror, when you felt that things were still possible in a new political context. Of course we now know that Vertov suffered in the Stalin era, as many other independent artists would have done, but there’s a sort of optimism and a playfulness to it that you wouldn’t expect from a Soviet documentary from 1929. Le Sang des Bêtes, Georges Franju, 1949 This is a documentary about an abattoir that was made in Paris just after the second world war. If the film had been shot in colour it would be unwatchable, it’s so gory and weird and disturbing, but it’s in black and white and so it becomes a bit more abstract. There are images in that film that I think are some of the most powerful I’ve ever seen. There’s a surreal sequence where lots of sheep have been beheaded and they’re all dancing without their heads on this conveyor belt. It’s like a bit of choreographed horror, but it’s all real. The director Georges Franju went on to have a career doing very artistic horror movies in French cinema, most famously a film called Les Yeux Sans Visage. The War Game, Peter Watkins, 1965 In this film, Watkins takes a possible scenario – a nuclear attack on London – and shows you very carefully, each step of the way, what is likely to happen. It was banned by the BBC for many years because it was just too harrowing a depiction of a reality that everyone at that time was very concerned about: this was in the middle of the cold war and at the time there were dozens of warheads pointing at us. It’s like a documentary made by Brecht – you’re staging something to flush out a reaction in the audience, and that reaction is one of utter horror. Some people would say this is not a documentary because everything was staged, but it’s a speculative documentary – the director is saying: “This is how it could be and I’m going to show you this in a way that’s very truthful.” It’s very responsible, even if the imagery is very disturbing: you’re seeing bobbies firing at people in the street, people with their clothes burned off. His information is sourced directly from the government and based on scientific fact, so the bed of it is factual, and people responded to it as if it were a real documentary. It’s a brilliant and bold piece of film-making. He’s reinventing the documentary and subverting it. In my view there should be no rules and no boundaries to film-making, and the impact this film had shows you how much he got right. The Battle of Chile, Patricio Guzmán, 1975, 1976, 1979 This is a trilogy of films that chronicles the coup against the democratically elected leftwing government of Salvador Allende. It shows you the breakdown of a society and the triumph of the greater evil once there’s a political vacuum, so it’s a very strongly political film but it’s also, dare I say it, incredibly exciting. For me, this is the first great example of a film-maker being there while it’s all actually happening and there are moments in it that are utterly heartbreaking. Notoriously, there’s one point where they are filming a demonstration and you hear a gunshot and you see the camera just fall down and tip over and the cameraman has been shot and killed. That shows you the terror of these situations, where no one is safe from the forces of darkness, but also the commitment of the film-maker to document this, to extract a proper historical document from these terrible events. It’s a work of great bravery and definitive historical significance. Primate, Frederick Wiseman, 1974 Wiseman is probably my favourite film-maker in fiction or nonfiction, and Primate meant a lot to me because I made a film [Project Nim] that emerged from some of its ideas. It’s a portrait of a primate experimental laboratory in Texas and there’s imagery that you cannot forget. You see operations on animals that are still alive, their brains being looked at while they’re still twitching around, so it’s very disturbing and upsetting. It’s an interesting window on the hubris of science, which does things for its own sake because it can do them. A lot of the experiments done in this laboratory seem utterly pointless. Wiseman is a purist. He doesn’t use commentary, he doesn’t use music, he doesn’t use interviews, he just observes things and then finds a rhythm in his cutting room to show you the reality, usually of an institution, and the human fallibilities of institutions. Primate is really about the humans, not the animals. The animals hold a mirror up to people in that institution, and we don’t pass that test very well. J’OC Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy: ‘Documentaries can change the way people look at things’ The journalist and film-maker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy was born in Karachi, Pakistan. Her films Saving Face (2012), about acid attacks in Pakistan, and A Girl in the River (2015), which tackled the subject of honour killings, both won Oscars for best short subject documentary. Amy, Asif Kapadia, 2015 It’s so rare that someone’s life has been so well documented. From when Amy Winehouse was very young right up to the time she died, people were filming her: her family, her friends, the media. I absolutely loved the way Asif Kapadia told her story using all that footage – as if he was with Amy her whole life. As a viewer, you really get to know her and understand what she went through. You’re cheering her on, hoping that she does get over her addiction, does beat the paparazzi, does come out on top. The film made me realise how much of her life was not in her hands. Iraq in Fragments, James Longley, 2006 I was amazed that this film was shot on a camcorder, because it was so beautiful and it showed Iraq in a completely different light. All the images coming out of Iraq at the time were images of war. This showed what everyday life felt like – it was almost as if the director was shutting the war out. You felt the violence, but he doesn’t show it. The film records three different perspectives. One storyline follows a young Sunni boy without a father in Baghdad, another shows you the followers of the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in the south, and in the third you’re with a Kurdish family in the north who are happy the Americans are there. It also tracks how Iraq has changed from one generation to the next. Buena Vista Social Club, Wim Wenders, 1999 Cuba was a mystery to many people when this film was made. It was under sanctions and closed off to the US. With Buena Vista Social Club, it was as if Wim Wenders put aside the sanctions, the politics, and played with the language of music. These musicians and their stories moved people, whatever their politics. The film put you on the streets of Havana, you saw how people ate, how they interacted with each other, the way they danced and sang. Even without being political, the film is political, because it shows you what life was like inside Cuba at a time when the only perspective you got on the country was through a news lens. The Thin Blue Line, Errol Morris, 1988 This film showed me that documentaries can change the way people look at things. It’s centred on a murder that took place in 1976: a young man stole a car, picked up a hitchhiker called Randall Adams and later a policeman was shot and killed by someone in the car. Adams was given a life sentence for the murder but Morris’s documentary showed, by exploring the testimony and the way the police put the case together, that he had been wrongly accused. A year after the film came out, Adams was released from prison. That was the bit about the movie that really shook me. It oscillated between art and activism. It was a gripping drama but it also had an impact in the real world. Bowling for Columbine, Michael Moore, 2002 This was a landmark film for me because it made documentaries popular – people who didn’t normally watch documentary films watched this. It tells the story of the Columbine high school massacre and the investigations that followed, but more than that it tells you about the National Rifle Association, about gun violence, about how schools in Michigan had become battlegrounds. His interview with Charlton Heston, who was the NRA’s president at that time, was very powerful and I remember the scene where he goes into a bank and gets a free hunting rifle for opening an account. On the way out, he asks: “Do you think it’s a little dangerous handing out guns at a bank?” He told the story beautifully and he asked the questions a viewer would want to ask. KF Franny Armstrong: ‘By the end of Some Kind of Monster, I quite liked Metallica’ Franny Armstrong is the UK director of The Age of Stupid, a reflection from 2055 on climate change, McLibel, about the McDonald’s court case, and Drowned Out,, on the fight against the Narmada dam. Global Report, Peter Armstrong, 1981 This was a BBC documentary made by my father in the 1980s. I remember he took me on a trip to New York when I was eight years old and I ended up watching it over and over again. It just really blew my mind. I’d never been out of the UK and suddenly I was seeing this extreme wealth on show in New York and at the same time being hit by the extreme poverty in my dad’s film. I’ve chosen it because I think that’s where my whole drive to change things for the better came from. It shows five different stories from different parts of the world. It’s a bit similar to Unreported World, but back then it was considered groundbreaking. It was telling the stories that the rest of the media weren’t telling and the one that stuck with me was the story about a little boy my age in India who was having to sell peanuts on the side of the road in order to make money for his family. That was my introduction to the concept of inequality. The Queen of Versailles, Lauren Greenfield, 2012 Inequality is obviously one of the key issues of our time and I think this is the best film I’ve seen on the subject. The film-makers were following this mega-rich American family, the Siegels, who were building the biggest house in the United States – a mansion in Florida inspired by Versailles – and then the financial crash happens and they lose lots of money and they can’t finish it. They’ve got lots of children who are being looked after by a Filipina nanny, who we learn hasn’t seen her own children for years because she can’t afford a ticket to go home. The thing that really stayed with me was when the children’s pet lizard dies because nobody had fed it and it turns out that they didn’t even know they had a pet lizard because they’re so overwhelmed with material possessions. Everyone in the film is unhappy, the ones who’ve got too much stuff and the woman who can’t see her own kids. It’s an amazing example of the story of a major global issue being told in a very small way, in this case through a dead lizard. Blackfish, Gabriela Cowperthwaite, 2013 This is perhaps an odd choice, because I haven’t actually seen it as I find the subject matter too upsetting, but I’ve chosen it as an example of a documentary that sets out to change something material and succeeds. It’s about Tilikum, a performing killer whale being kept in captivity at SeaWorld. In the last few weeks, SeaWorld has announced that it will no longer breed orcas in captivity or acquire any new ones. It shows how one extremely powerful documentary can work alongside campaigning and holding demonstrations to bring about change. Lessons of Darkness, Werner Herzog, 1995 Lessons of Darkness is by the far the most powerful anti-war film I’ve ever seen. It was shot just after the first Gulf war, when the Iraqi oilfields were famously set on fire. The film is essentially just a continuing aerial shot of these burning oilfields set to beautiful music. It’s completely mesmeric and beautiful in an apocalyptic way, and it just goes on and on. You can’t believe how big, how many and how endless these oilfields are, or how wanton the destruction is. And just when you’re thinking “OK, I’ve had enough” it cuts to a mother and a child and the mother just tells the story of what happened to her family during the war, and then she says, of the boy who is about five years old: “This child has never spoken again.” And that’s all there is to the film. It’s so bold. You have to be Werner Herzog to get away with that. Some Kind of Monster, Joe Berlinger, Bruce Sinofsky, 2004 I’ve chosen this as a bit of light relief, because it’s rip-roaring fun. The film follows the heavy metal band Metallica as they go through group therapy. God knows how the directors ever got permission to do it, but it’s just so incongruous to see these ageing rockers discussing their personal problems in such an open way. What strikes you is the difference between their tough image and music and the pettiness of their squabbles over who gets the most credit on a record. It follows them over a couple of years while they’re rehearsing a new album and searching for a new bass player, but you also get to see them trying to balance their personal lives with being heavy metal performers – you see one of the band members going to his daughter’s ballet class, for example. It’s way more absurd than Spinal Tap, but what’s most strange is that by the end of it I actually quite liked their music and I’m really not a heavy metal fan. J’OC Khalo Matabane: ‘Some film-makers try to be objective, but Herzog isn’t shy’ Khalo Matabane was born in Limpopo, South Africa. His documentaries include Nelson Mandela: The Myth and Me and Story of a Beautiful Country, a road movie that explores post-apartheid South Africa. When the Levees Broke, Spike Lee, 2006 I saw this four-part documentary in a single night at a friend’s house in Amsterdam and I was completely blown away. It’s an angry, in-depth look at how the levees failed in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina and what happened in the aftermath. It really moved me and gave me an insight into race relations in the US and what it means to be poor in a developed nation. The images of bodies floating in the water and people trying to save themselves and their neighbours have really stayed with me, and the music by jazz trumpeter Terence Blanchard – who also appears in the movie – is really memorable. Capturing the Friedmans, Andrew Jarecki, 2003 This felt more to me like fiction than documentary – I remember watching it and thinking, can these people be real? It’s about a father and son in Long Island who were convicted of molesting children in the 1980s. The film-maker Andrew Jarecki discovered that the family had an archive of home movies from the time, documenting how they coped with the accusations and the trial. What amazed me was the access: I’ve always been curious how Jarecki managed to persuade the Friedmans to bare their souls and let him use the videos. The result is a disturbing portrait of a very unconventional family. Grizzly Man, Werner Herzog, 2005 What I remember most from this documentary is Werner Herzog’s voice. Ostensibly this is a film about a man called Timothy Treadwell, who spent many summers living among grizzly bears in Alaska and was eventually mauled to death and eaten by an enormous brown bear. Herzog turns it into a much grander meditation on loneliness and man’s relationship with nature. Many film-makers try to be objective and avoid giving their opinions, but Herzog isn’t shy about being authoritative. When he addresses the camera directly in that strange monotone of his, it’s almost like you’re listening to the voice of God. The 3 Rooms of Melancholia, Pirjo Honkasalo, 2004 I saw this at a film festival in Amsterdam and it had a huge impact on me. It confronts you with images of war from Chechnya, with a particular focus on the children caught up in the conflict (the second Chechen war that began in 1999). It’s incredibly sad but I really liked that it didn’t try to push a war-is-bad message on you, like a Michael Moore film. It just provides testimony and lets you make up your own mind. I was also struck by the artistic nature of the film-making and how images of war and catastrophe can also be beautiful. I’m sure people had problems with that, but it meant the images stuck with me long after I saw the film. Pina, Wim Wenders, 2011 I didn’t know anything about Pina Bausch or contemporary dance before I saw this film – I only went to see it because Wim Wenders directed it. The fact that I really enjoyed it and didn’t want it to end just goes to show what power documentaries can have. Pina Bausch died just as Wenders was preparing to make a film about her, so instead he filmed her dance troupe in Germany talking about Pina and re-enacting her work. One detail I really loved was the way he disconnected the voiceovers from the images of the people who are speaking. It added to the film’s very strong emotional effect. KF Molly Dineen: ‘Adam Curtis made us look again at our own world’ Born in Canada and raised in Birmingham, documentary director and cinematographer Molly Dineen won Baftas for her 1993 series The Ark and 2007 film The Lie of the Land, and Royal Television Society awards for 1987’s Home from the Hill and 1989’s Heart of the Angel. Into Eternity, Michael Madsen, 2010 I saw this when I was on a jury at a documentary festival in Nyon, and it was really unexpected. It’s about Finland burying its nuclear waste in a deep, deep cavern, with two diggers silently burrowing into the bedrock. That’s intercut with interviews with scientists talking about how you can leave a signal for future civilisations not to go into this burial chamber. This stuff is so toxic for 100,000 years, so we’re not talking about any sort of signposting we will understand; there may be whole different ways of communication. There was something really affecting about that. And the interviews are fabulous, because they’re very unpromising – just straight-on head-and-shoulders shots of scientists – but they’re humorous and warm and compassionate. Le Joli Mai, Chris Marker and Pierre Lhomme, 1963 They showed this to us when I first went to the National Film School and I absolutely loved it. It’s about the beautiful month of May in Paris, and it starts with a voiceover by actress Simone Signoret, saying as only French people could, “It’s the most beautiful city in the world and against this set, 8 million Parisians act out a play.” And it’s this fantastic springboard into a series of observed vignettes: famous people, shopkeepers, passers-by, mothers, sons, black, white, men, women. It’s like a wonderful complex tapestry – without wanting to sound like a pillock – of life. And this was the first time France hadn’t been at war since 1939, so there’s this beautiful feeling about it. Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer, Nick Broomfield And Joan Churchill, 2003 This is the last interview with Aileen Wuornos [who killed seven men in Florida in 1989-90] before she’s executed. There’s a very interesting tension as to whose film it is. She sees it as her opportunity to set the record straight, saying it was self-protection – I thought she came across well and I was incredibly moved by her situation. But on the other hand Nick and Joan are making the film about her. At the end it’s very shocking because he asks her a question she doesn’t like and she’s screaming, “fuck you, Nick”, as she’s dragged off to be executed. And yet you feel it’s something he had to ask, because I suppose in a documentary you have to have the film‑maker in charge. The Power of Nightmares, Adam Curtis, 2004 I think that Adam Curtis is a completely independent voice, and he presents situations and current affairs back to us in a radical way. The Power of Nightmares is a three-part BBC documentary where he addresses al-Qaida and the fact that it’s been very useful for governments to have something to be scared of. In the context of the whole world being terrified of al-Qaida, this made you rethink received opinion; he made us look again at our own world. I love his delivery and the way he uses archive material and music. His style is so unusual and imaginative and rich and draws on all sorts of other cultural references that we have. Sisters in Law, Kim Longinotto, 2006 This is about two female judges in Kumba, Cameroon dealing with cases of violence against women. Kim Longinotto and I work in a very similar way, so I think I appreciate her films even more. It’s difficult to immerse yourself in another culture, and in a different language, when to a European this is a very alien community. Kim always puts herself out to the nth degree: she manages to be in the right place and observe and tell the story through character. I think it’s because of her character – she’s warm, she’s humble, she’s sensible – that she relates to people so well, and boy, does it come across here. It’s a brilliant film. KB Angus Macqueen:‘Television’s contribution to the documentary form has been huge’ Angus Macqueen is a British film-maker whose latest film is The Legend of Shorty (2014), about the search for Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. Other films include Gulag and The Death of Yugoslavia. Man on Wire, James Marsh, 2008 This is the story of an event in 1974, when a French tightrope-walker named Philippe Petit decided to sling a wire between the Twin Towers in New York and walk across it. It’s not an easy story to tell on film, but they did an extraordinary job. I loved the decision to shoot it like a heist movie, showing how Petit and his gang staked out the towers and set up the rope without anyone noticing. The director got across the lunatic absurdity of the whole project and the sense that Petit’s walk was not just a physical feat but also an act of art. Too often, documentaries are painful and difficult to watch, but this was a real pleasure. Little Dieter Needs to Fly, Werner Herzog, 1998 This is one of Werner Herzog’s less well-known documentaries. It’s an astonishing story about a German-American military pilot called Dieter Dengler who grew up in Germany during the second world war, then went to America, enlisted in the air force and fought in Vietnam. He crashed his plane over Laos and was taken prisoner by Laotian troops, then handed over to the Viet Cong. Herzog takes him back to revisit the whole ordeal and meet his former captors. It’s a remarkable piece of documentary film-making. Herzog later turned the story into a feature film called Rescue Dawn, which wasn’t very good. This is the one you need to see. Shoah, Claude Lanzmann, 1985 This is Claude Lanzmann’s nine-hour film about the Holocaust. My film Gulag was pretty directly inspired by it, though I would never claim to any of its greatness. What’s remarkable about Shoah is its monumentality: Lanzmann wanted to make a monument out of a documentary, and he didn’t care if you thought it was too long because the extraordinary nature of this event – the organised, mechanical destruction of human beings over an extended period of time – cannot be told in 45 minutes or an hour. It’s painful to watch but magnificently made. His meeting with Jan Karski, the Pole who reported what was going on in the Warsaw ghetto to the allied governments, is almost a film in itself. Lanzmann also finds some of the perpetrators and gets them to talk. Once you’ve seen it, it’s impossible to forget. Pandora’s Box, Adam Curtis, 1992 I think Adam Curtis is in many ways the most important documentary voice on British TV, simply because he puts across mad arguments and compels you to engage with them. This was his first series for the BBC (his best known is probably The Power of Nightmares) and his imaginative use of archive material is completely striking. The subtitle is “A Fable from the Age of Science” and it deals with a lot of things he’s fascinated by – communism, game theory, DDT, nuclear power – weaving them together in a very original way. It’s really worth seeing if you can find it. China: Beyond the Clouds, Phil Agland, 1994 This is a great documentary series made in China in the early 90s. Agland was an anthropologist and he’d already made a wonderful series in the 80s about the Baka tribe in Cameroon. For Beyond the Clouds, he spent several years in a small town in Yunnan province telling the stories of various characters he met. He focuses on normal people but in doing so tells us about China’s past as well as its present and the monumental change that was coming. It was beautifully shot, because he’s a very fine cameraman, and very memorable. Television’s contribution to the documentary form has been huge and this is television at its best.

This idea, put forward by environmental journalist Fred Pearce and others, may have received some pushback (eg Anne Chapman earlier in this series) but for me, it is merely a statement of the obvious. Consider that great scientific battleground of the early 21st century: embryonic stem cell research. Here is an issue where too many greens hold views indistinguishable from those of the Vatican. Greenpeace brought and won a lawsuit against the German scientist Oliver Brüstle who wanted to patent a method of turning human embryonic stem cells into neurons. In a debate with writer and neuroscientist Kenan Malik Greenpeace claimed they were not opposed to embryonic stem cell research. Yet their own press release at the time made it clear that they were opposed to it. Until 2010, the UK's Green Party had rather unambiguous views on the issue too: they wanted an EU wide ban on embryonic stem cell research. Parts of a statement from Caroline Lucas were reminiscent of the religious right: Personally, I remain concerned about the associated health risks, the commodification of eggs and embryos, and the potential exploitation of women. Increasing research suggests that there are a number of promising alternatives, for example adult stem cell research, and umbilical cord stem cell research. Exactly what did Lucas think the associated health risks are in attempting to cure debilitating diseases? To me, this is not merely anti-scientific, it is morally repugnant. And let's not forget the fondness of some environmental groups for destroying trials of genetically modified crops. Whether it is Monsanto or government scientists doing the research there always seems to be an environmentalist or two thinking of doing some uprooting. And we are not talking about fringe lunatics here. Last year's failed attempt to destroy a trial of GM wheat in Rothamsted was supported by both the Green Party's candidate for the London mayoral election and their current leader Natalie Bennett. Greenpeace has a much richer history of ripping up GM crops. For some the defining image of Greenpeace campaigning may be brave activists climbing Europe's tallest building, for me it is grown adults wearing hazmat suits to destroy crops they have no reason to be afraid of. That Greenpeace takes a dogmatic, not a scientific, approach was made clear when Lord Melchett, then director of Greenpeace UK, made the following statement on opposition to GM crops whilst appearing in front of the House of Lords: It is a permanent and definite and complete opposition based on a view that there will always be major uncertainties. It is the nature of the technology, indeed it is the nature of science, that there will not be any absolute proof. Such statements would make even religious dogmatists blush. The UK's main organic farming group, the Soil Association, naturally did not mind such dogmatism: they made Melchett their policy director. Our choices about the future of energy supply need to be based on solid evidence, yet let's consider the UK Green Party's attitude to the evidence about nuclear power. In 2003 they published a report, enthusiastically endorsed by Caroline Lucas, that claimed \"radioactive releases up to 1989 have caused, or will eventually cause, the death of 65 million people worldwide.\" The research into this report was written by the rather absurd figure of Chris Busby, who apparently for many years was the Green Party's main \"expert\" source on nuclear issues. I put scare-quotes round expert here for in late 2011 he was exposed for attempting to sell ineffective \"anti-radiation\" pills to people in the Fukushima region. For years the Green Party grounded their opposition to nuclear power in junk science, and it appears it still does. If all of this leaves you unconvinced of the marriage of irrational, unscientific, and unethical attitudes by many green organisations then you should read about the history of opposition to golden rice, an innovation that has the potential to greatly reduce human suffering. I could go on, but I think my point is made. However, I will have to say something about the inevitable resentment these comments will elicit from some readers. Am I not playing into the hands of the climate change sceptics by saying environmentalists are not consistent on science? No, I am not. Environmentalists who say we should accept the scientific consensus on climate change while telling us to ignore it on other issues are the people who are playing into the hands of those who oppose action on climate change. Because if we are to win the fight against climate change we will need to replace ideology, wishful thinking and spin with sober analysis. As the great physicist Richard Feynman said, reality must take precedence over public relations. This post is part of a series on science and the green movement following debate at this year's Science in Public conference. Robert Wilson is a PhD student in mathematical ecology at the University of Strathclyde, and writes at The Energy Collective."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/jan/20/european-greens-threaten-uk-government-shale-tax-breaks","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-20T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"European Greens consider challenge to UK tax breaks for shale gas drilling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/20/european-greens-threaten-uk-government-shale-tax-breaks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jan/20/european-greens-threaten-uk-government-shale-tax-breaks","fields":{"headline":"European Greens consider challenge to UK tax breaks for shale gas drilling","bodyText":"European Greens are considering a challenge to the UK's tax breaks and incentives for shale gas under state aid rules, as the government holds out against a new renewable energy target for the EU. Ministers have offered tax breaks to shale gas companies, and incentives to local communities to encourage them to accept drilling in their area. The government believes its plans comply with EU rules restricting state aid to companies. On Wednesday, the European commission is expected to announce proposals for a new target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, which is broadly accepted by large member states. Britain opposes an accompanying target on increasing the use of renewable energy, from 20% by 2020 to a possible 24-30% within 10 years after that. The threat to challenge the government's shale gas incentives is retaliation for that, and for Britain's attempts to foil a proposed directive on shale gas that would impose firm regulations on its exploitation. The Guardian understands several European commissioners are still objecting to the proposed emissions target, favouring a lower goal of 35% cuts by 2030. A compromise may be reached by Wednesday, potentially by introducing greater flexibility on renewable energy. The UK, France and Germany are in favour of a 40% emissions target, making it more likely that it will be accepted. Member states are also likely to pledge that if other leading economies, such as the US and China, pledge stringent cuts then the goal could be raised to a cut of 50%. Green MEPs are arguing in favour of much stronger targets. Emissions in the EU are set to be about 25% below 1990 levels in 2020, leaving a further cut of about 15% by 2030. At stake is the future of world governments' response to climate change, which will be decided at a crunch conference in Paris in 2015, under the United Nations. In the next year, all of the world's leading economies are expected to come up with their pledges on emissions cuts to take effect from 2020 onwards. This is seen as essential to avoiding the worst ravages of climate change, but so far the talks have made slow progress. A study by several academic research institutions, under the banner of the Stanford Energy Modelling Forum, found that increasing the current target of a 20% emissions cut by 2020, compared with 1990 levels, to a 40% target by 2030 would cost less than 0.7% of economic activity. Leading companies under the umbrella of the Prince of Wales EU Corporate Leaders Group have also endorsed the target. The UK is holding out against a renewables target, arguing that a mandated emissions reduction is enough. It is understood that the Treasury wants to be able to include nuclear power and fears that a renewable energy target would mean less investment in its favoured alternative, shale gas. Other member states, including Germany, are firmly in favour of an EU-wide target, as the current renewables goal is credited with bringing about strong growth in clean energy across the EU. The European commission argues that an EU-wide target enables greater flexibility, as some member states, including the UK, can take on a lower share of the target as others, such as Germany, power ahead on renewables. The target would also allow for investment in renewable energy overseas to be counted. But the government's position has been criticised by campaigners and are understood to have discouraged renewable energy companies. RWE recently announced plans to drastically scale back its investment in clean energy in the UK. Asad Rehman, international climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \"Genuine commitment on climate would see binding carbon cuts of at least 70% by 2030, as well as mandatory targets on energy efficiency and renewable power. But despite all the rhetoric about the need to slash emissions, the Commission is still dancing to the tune of big polluters and energy-guzzling firms.\" Claude Turmes, vice chair of the Green Group of MEPs, said: \"It is important that we ensure ambitious and coherent binding targets for greenhouse gas reductions, renewables and energy savings. This would provide much-needed investor certainty, not only in the energy sector but for industrial sectors and innovation across Europe, and give a boost to employment and the economy. The EU should not repeat the mistake made with the lack of ambition in its 2020 greenhouse gas reduction target, as this has undermined the effectiveness of overall climate policy and key instruments like the emissions trading scheme. To this end, we should be aiming for a 60% reduction by 2030, which a number of independent studies have shown is possible.\" He added that a renewable energy target was needed to encourage investment in clean technology. \"Given the undeniable success of the 2020 renewable energy target, it is imperative that the EU continues the momentum and adopts a binding 2030 target. Failure to do so would cause massive uncertainty at a time when we need to be rapidly moving ahead towards a renewable-energy-based economy.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/oct/29/budapest-viktor-orban-democracy-edge-hungary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-29T12:49:52Z","webTitle":"Budapest autumn: hollowing out democracy on the edge of Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/29/budapest-viktor-orban-democracy-edge-hungary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/oct/29/budapest-viktor-orban-democracy-edge-hungary","fields":{"headline":"Budapest autumn: hollowing out democracy on the edge of Europe","bodyText":"On the Hungarian plain south-west of Budapest, the rich, dark soil of Kishantos presents the saddest of sights. As far as the eye can see, a cornucopia of organic wheat, cereals, sunflowers, pulses and legumes has been turned into a vista of emptiness. In what appears to be an extraordinary act of vindictive destruction, a lifetime’s work in Hungary has been destroyed in only a few months. Eva Acs, an agronomist who has run the thriving organic farm for 22 years, is at her wits’ end. “The state just took the farm away. We were absolutely punished and rubbed out. Then the private security firms came in and closed down the roads and blocked the tractors. The new owners destroyed all our plants and crops. Just to bankrupt us and hurt us.” Since the 90s, Acs has overseen one of Europe’s biggest organic farms, earning international plaudits and coveted Swiss “bio-certificates” for pioneering work on a vast scale, covering 452 hectares (1,116 acres) of rolling fields, land that was leased from the Hungarian state. Last year, the government cancelled the contracts and sold all but nine hectares to oligarchs and businessmen, who ordered the destruction of the organic bounty. Three weeks ago, they dealt the final blow, spraying the area with glyphosate weedkiller and instantly terminating the farm’s organic status. In the handsome 19th-century manor house at the centre of the estate, surrounded by sacks of drying red peppers, Acs has no doubt about who to blame for her heartbreak: the all-powerful conservative government in Budapest under Viktor Orbán, the prime minister. “You can’t imagine how high the pressure is now. We’re living in fear. We have to protect one another. This couldn’t happen in a normal country. It’s incredible the things that are happening in this country.” For the liberal middle classes of Budapest, the latest outrage in Orbán’s Hungary is the world’s first internet tax, a gigabyte levy denounced at home and abroad as an assault on free speech while shoring up the budget. On Tuesday tens of thousands of protesters commanded bridges over the Danube in central Budapest in the biggest challenge to the prime minister since he returned to power in 2010. The demonstrators likened Orbán to Russia’s Vladimir Putin, and flew the EU flag, which Orban regularly denounces. Bernadett Szél, MP and co-leader of a small Green liberal party, cites the events in Kishantos and Budapest as a prime example of the “endless cynicism” of the prime minister and his party, Fidesz, whose actions and policies set him apart in the European Union, and are setting off alarm bells in Brussels and Washington. “Kishantos is a symbol of what Orbán is doing. It’s pure power and pure destruction. Fidesz is the state. The party is the state. We don’t know how to end that.” In a time of collapsing public confidence in the political classes across Europe, Orbán can claim to be unique – a gifted, popular strongman with the most formidable electoral mandate in the EU. Untroubled by a fragmented and morally bankrupt centre-left opposition, Orbán led his rightwing Fidesz to a landslide victory in 2010. He coasted to a second term last April, won the European elections in May and in October took control of virtually every town and city in Hungary in local elections. Highly unusually, he has a two-thirds parliamentary majority, meaning that the vast Westminster lookalike on the banks of the Danube in Budapest is a rubber stamp. After his election hat-trick this year, he need not face the voters again until 2018. He shows every sign of using that time to reshape Hungary. The only organised opposition are the neo-fascists of the Jobbik party on the far right, suggesting that the opposition on the streets this week might challenge Orbán but not really threaten him. “Orbán divides and rules. All decisions are taken by him,” says a senior western diplomat in Budapest. “He’s very skilled. He has a political vision. You might not like it, but he has it. Control is the key word here.” Zsuzsanna Szelényi, a liberal left MP and psychologist who has studied Orbán at close quarters as a colleague in the 1990s, describes him as restless and combative with leanings towards megalomania. “He’s a very strong character, he’s always talking of revolution. And a very polarising person. He needs enemies and is always creating them. That’s how he sees the world. He was always a destructive person.” The number one item on Orbán’s destroy list appears to be the western democratic model. In an infamous speech to supporters in Romania in July, he declared the western model dead and cited the authoritarian regimes of Russia, China, Turkey and Singapore as the templates to follow. “We are parting ways with western European dogmas, making ourselves independent from them,” he declared. “We have to abandon liberal methods and principles of organising a society. The new state that we are building is an illiberal state, a non-liberal state.” To his many critics in Budapest, this means hollowing out democracy, retaining a semblance of pluralism while controlling all the key levers. Orbán has used his power to rewrite the constitution and has appointed 11 of the 15 supreme court justices to guarantee himself a two-thirds majority on the constitutional court. “The vast majority of the justices are not only politically loyal, but very strongly connected to the Fidesz party,” says Csaba Tordai, a constitutional lawyer. Orbán has used new media laws to turn public television into a mouthpiece for his government, and used tax inspectors and advertising money to intimidate, impoverish and weaken critical media. “Journalists don’t go to jail here. But he controls the media and there’s a lot of self-censorship,” said the senior diplomat. “When they want to intimidate they send in the tax inspectors. And you can always find something.” He has launched a crackdown on opposition non-governmental organisations, accusing some of them, Putin-style, of being foreign agents. “During the day these guys are civil activists and during the night they’re political activists,” says a senior government official. According to western and Hungarian diplomats in Budapest, Orbán is planning to purge the diplomatic service, culling up to three-quarters of Hungary’s ambassadors. He wants the banking sector, which is dominated by Austrians and Italians, partly renationalised so that 50% is in Hungarian hands. He has also ordered land leased by foreigners over the past 20 years to be returned to its Hungarian owners, arguing that the natives have been swindled by wealthy westerners. Brussels is threatening legal action. “China says it’s a democracy,” says the government spokesman, Zsoltan Kovacs, explaining the new policy. “By liberal, the prime minister means a rejection of everything before 2010.” The radicalism of Orbán’s vision for Hungary has put him on a collision course with Brussels, although the EU is crucial to his plans as Hungary is to receive €34bn (£26.8bn) in European funds over the next four years. Defying EU policy, Orbán has cuddled up to Putin in Moscow at a time of the greatest tensions between Russia and the west since the 1980s. The result has been the strongest criticism from Washington of an EU member state. In January, Orbán secretly went to Moscow, met Putin, and secured a $10bn (£6.2bn) credit in return for awarding nuclear power contracts to the Russians. In September, he met the boss of Gazprom, the giant Russian gas monopoly, and ditched EU policy on Russia and Ukraine by refusing to repump gas supplies back to Ukraine from Hungary, sabotaging EU attempts to safeguard Kiev’s energy requirements. Barack Obama unusually bracketed Hungary, a Nato ally and EU member state, recently with Azerbaijan, Russia, Venezuela and Egypt in attacking Orbán’s attitude to fundamental freedoms. Victoria Nuland, the US assistant secretary of state for European affairs, then went further in a clear reference to Orban: “How can you sleep under your Nato blanket at night while pushing ‘illiberal democracy’ by day, whipping up nationalism, restricting free press, or demonising civil society?” The Americans then blacklisted 10 Hungarian officials, some of them said to be close to the prime minister, banning them from entering the US on the grounds of corruption and complaining about “kleptocracy”. The Orbán government, prone to fanning paranoia and regularly conjuring conspiracy theories about foreign plots to undermine Hungary, insinuated the White House had been bribed. “We know the amount of money it cost to put Hungary’s name alongside Egypt’s,” said the senior government official. “It’s quite a lot of money. We know who’s funding it. It’s not easy with the Americans most of the time. It’s quite unfriendly.” In April, around the same time as Acs’s organic crops were being pulverised, Budapest police raided the home of Vera Mora and took away her laptop. Mora runs the environmentalist non-governmental organisation Őkotárs in Budapest, which acts as the intermediary distributor of money from Norway’s generous aid programme for civil society projects in central and eastern Europe. Norway is providing €153m to Hungary over five years, 10% of it to “independent” NGOs. Orbán’s government demanded control over how the money is spent. Oslo refused and suspended payments of €140m, while still distributing €13m through Őkotárs. The government then raided the NGO’s offices and launched a corruption investigation. The investigators have said they are pressing charges “on suspicion of mismanagement, budget fraud, forgery of private documents and unauthorised financial activity.” Reviewing the police evidence, the news website index.hu said: “This is how a show trial looks in a history book.” The Norwegians are furious, demanding that Brussels take action. “We have this programme in 16 countries. The only place we have problems is Hungary,” said Tove Skarstein, the Norwegian ambassador in Budapest. “The fact that something like this is happening in the EU is quite shocking,” said Mora. In his drive to create a new political system in Hungary, Orbán appears to view politics as a zero-sum game where the winner takes all in a fight between good and evil. In July, Orbán thanked the opposition for his landslide victories – “those who turned against us and provided the chance for good to win. Because if there is no bad, how could good get mastery over the bad?” It is a binary, polarising outlook that recalls the tactics of another strongman leader, president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey. Both appear to believe democracy ends at the ballot box. “Democracy does not mean the dictatorship of the majority,” said Marton Gulyas, director of Krétakőr, a political art and theatre group whose state funding has been reduced by the Hungarian government. “People were tired of the endless fighting and in 2010 they said we need one leader to put the country in order, to take it in one direction. We were in no-man’s land. Since then they’ve changed everything.” In a detailed analysis of the clampdown on civil society, Heather Grabbe, director of EU affairs in Brussels for George Soros’s Open Society Foundations, concluded Orbán was rolling back the democratic gains achieved in central Europe since the revolutions of 1989, which brought Orbán to national prominence as a student leader telling the Russians to go home. “Hungary is quickly losing the defining features of a democracy under the rule of law,” Grabbe wrote. “Independent civil society organisations are the last remaining check on government power in Hungary. Since 2010 the government has enjoyed a parliamentary super-majority which it has used to undermine the independence of the judiciary, the power of the constitutional court and media freedom and pluralism, as well as to gain control over state institutions.” But while Orbán has amassed formidable power, he is not omnipotent as the current wave of internet-fuelled protest shows. His vote is down considerably since 2010. He does not command a simple voters’ majority either in Budapest or nationwide.

The sweeping reforms, detailed in the draft energy bill, grant the government powers to intervene in the market on a scale not seen since the industry was privatised. Under the changes, low-carbon generators including nuclear companies will receive a fixed price for their energy that should be higher than they can sell it for on the open market, and ministers will create a \"capacity market\" to ensure a reliable supply of power and prevent blackouts. There will be a minimum price for carbon dioxide emissions, and an emissions performance standard that will in effect stop any coal-fired power stations being built without technology to capture carbon. The reforms will mean major changes to the way the market is regulated, and the way utilities and their smaller rivals operate. Ed Davey, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, said the reforms would help to bring forward the estimated £110bn in private-sector investment that will be needed for new low-carbon energy capacity, and that they could generate as many as 250,000 new jobs. \"Leaving the electricity market as it is would not be in the national interest,\" Davey said, noting that a fifth of the UK's current ageing power stations are likely to come out of service by 2020. \"If we don't secure investment in our energy infrastructure, we could see the lights going out, consumers hit by spiralling energy prices and dangerous climate change. These reforms will ensure we can keep the lights on, bills down and the air clean.\" Davey said the government's analysis showed that the reforms would ensure that consumers' energy bills would rise by less than they would otherwise over the next 20 years. Charles Hendry, the minister of state for energy, said the government had to intervene: \"The market did a good job keeping down [energy] prices to the lowest in Europe, but it did not bring forward enough new investment. If we are going to keep the lights on in an affordable way, this is not a luxury – it's absolutely essential.\" But there was widespread concern about some of the most vulnerable people. Maria Wardrobe, director of external affairs at the fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said: \"The government can do little to disguise that these proposals will add substantially to already soaring energy bills and place much more risk on domestic energy consumers.\" She called for VAT revenues from fuel to be recycled into energy-efficiency programmes to lift vulnerable people out of fuel poverty. Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said: \"We want to see more evidence and the small print before we can judge whether this will work for all of us who are expected to foot the bill.\" Green groups and some renewable energy companies also attacked the draft bill, accusing ministers of breaking promises not to subsidise nuclear power, because the \"contracts for difference\" by which low-carbon power generators will be guaranteed a price for their electricity will favour the nuclear industry. Davey denied the charge, and said the plans would encourage all forms of low-carbon generation, helping the UK to meet its climate-change targets. By giving generators a fixed price guaranteed in advance for their power, the \"contracts for difference\" system should offset the risks taken by renewable and nuclear developers, which have to shoulder high upfront costs before they can start reaping the returns from their investment. If the market price turns out higher than the \"strike price\" agreed in advance, there will be arrangements to claw back some of the difference. However, many of the details on how some of the reforms will work have yet to be set out. For instance, the \"strike price\" for the first round of contracts for difference will not be set until 2013, and a \"delivery plan\" for implementing them will come into force in mid-2014. Neil Bentley, deputy director-general, said: \"It's now important that parliament not only gets it right, but does so as a matter of urgency. We face a real risk of electricity shortages in the second half of the decade [and] we are still some way from having a detailed picture of how the electricity market will look in the future, on which the success of these reforms depends. With major investors waiting in the wings, these details are needed as soon as possible.\" Bridget Woodman, of the energy policy group at the University of Exeter, said: \"Rarely can an energy measure have attracted such universal condemnation. The key players – renewable generators, most energy companies, consumer groups and commentators – all recognise that contracts for difference won't deliver a sustainable energy future ... The government is in a hole and needs to stop digging before it's too late to put the UK on a path to a sustainable energy future.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/aug/20/shale-gas-too-good-an-opportunity","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-20T19:59:00Z","webTitle":"Letters: Is shale gas too good an opportunity to miss?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/20/shale-gas-too-good-an-opportunity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/aug/20/shale-gas-too-good-an-opportunity","fields":{"headline":"Is shale gas too good an opportunity to miss?","bodyText":"I would like to take issue with the recent statement made on behalf of the mission and public affairs group in the Church of England which suggests that opinions on fracking should remain open as cheap gas obtained through fracking will provide jobs, could help those in fuel poverty and would have less impact than more polluting fuels (As new protest looms, Church argues against total opposition to fracking, 17 August). I find these comments baffling. Fuel bills have risen because of rising gas prices and inadequately insulated homes, not because of green energy measures, so it's unclear why more gas would address fuel poverty. The government's \"dash for gas\" strategy is a false solution to climate change. Evidence (such as that from the US Environmental Protection Agency) suggests that fracked gas may be just as bad for global warming as coal (largely because of methane escape), in addition to all the local environmental issues. Gas prices are only lower because of government subsidies in the form of tax breaks. If these subsidies were invested in renewables (as Germany is doing), it would guarantee future energy supplies at affordable prices as well as create jobs. I don't doubt that fracking might yield gas supplies in the short term, but with huge environmental consequences. Scientists tell us that to avoid devastating climate change we must not only stop exploring for new fossil fuels, but also leave the majority of current stocks in the ground. Those who support fracking as a means of meeting our energy needs are looking for short-term financial gain for the UK irrespective of the longer-term impact on and costs to our global community. We should rather be aware of the ethical issues around our energy usage and do all we can to encourage energy conservation and renewable energy sources. Isabel Carter Chair of Operation Noah • I have to agree with your editorial that we are nowhere near a practical energy policy fit for the future (How not to win an argument, 19 August). However, current debate focuses on the supply side without looking at how we could easily, significantly and permanently reduce our consumption of energy. If energy companies (whose business plan must to be increase supply of energy) were forced to introduce tariffs that increase as we use more energy, there would be a real incentive for us all to reduce consumption in the many ways possible, while simultaneously creating a less unjust society. Such tariffs could offer free energy for the most basic needs, and then progressively increase the more we use. It might mean that the cost of heating that swimming pool and other luxuries would increase massively, while hypothermia and death because of fuel poverty would disappear. Perhaps this is exactly what a sensible energy policy would ensure – reducing demand, reducing supply, generation by renewables, and social justice (which must include our near and distant descendants). The opposite to a sensible energy policy is George Osborne handing out tax breaks and public subsidies to extract shale gas to burn as if, beyond that next shareholders' meeting, there were no tomorrow. Dr Colin Bannon Crapstone, Devon • As a former chair of the Green party and a lifelong environmental campaigner, I can only applaud Caroline Lucas's brave stance against fracking at Balcombe (Green fingered: MP Lucas arrested at fracking protest, 20 August). But it's an inconvenient truth that shale gas is too good an opportunity to miss, as is the fact that there will be unpleasant consequences. The removal of the waste water will cause substantial local disruption and its disposal presents pollution and health hazards. In the future it will be for protesters and authorities alike to ensure that these are kept to a minimum and compensation for those affected at a maximum. Hugo Charlton London • All serious studies of fracking have shown the environmental damage it causes to be by no means nonexistent but less than any other major means of energy production. The well-meaning but misguided people of Balcombe should club together to hire a coach for the relatively short ride to Wytch Farm in Dorset to see what fracking is really like. David Harris London • There is an argument that, as we move to a low-carbon energy policy in the UK, we need to adopt a \"least worst\" approach. Conventional gas may not be as low-carbon as renewables, but it is better than coal. Unfortunately, when shale gas is extracted using fracking, the extra methane leaked at the well head makes it a greenhouse gas emitter that is at least 20% worse than coal and could be twice as bad over a 20-year timespan (See the 2011 article \"Methane and the greenhouse-gas footprint of natural gas from shale formations\" by Robert W Howarth and others in the journal Climatic Change). Nuclear recycling is one possible solution: we have an abundant supply of radioactive waste in the UK that needs to be dealt with, and it is a low-carbon energy source. Fracking for shale gas has no redeeming features. Andrew Gould Emsworth, Hampshire • Nice one, George Monbiot, for pointing out the testosterone-driven need for puny politicians to embrace the man's world of big energy projects (What is behind this fracking mania? Unbridled machismo, 20 August). But I missed any mention of nuclear power. This too drains money from energy efficiency and renewables, has as yet insoluble waste problems, and is also part of a potential race to \"mutually assured destruction\" globally – through the spread of nuclear weapons made possible by nuclear power programmes.

It was an unpredicted phenomenon, but shale gas, now more than a decade old, accounts for 40% of the natural gas in the US. The success of shale production, that has reached large areas of America where no gas development previously existed, birthed the largest environmental movement since the anti-nuclear power protests of the Three Mile Island era. The \"fracking wars\" have come to America and the world, with the recently fired French energy and environment minister saying shale gas supporters wanted her scalp. The massive supply of shale gas crashed the price of gas from $13 for a thousand cubic feet in July 2008 to below $4, delivering heating and electricity savings of $1,000 per year to many US consumers and helping to fend off further recession in 2011 and 2012. These large price reductions in heat and power – necessities of life – are especially vital for those living in poverty, and a welcome turn of luck for median-income households. As a result of shale gas, fortune has smiled as well on millions of Americans who have lease their land to the drilling industry. They receive payments and royalty checks that total tens of billions of dollars. Hundreds of thousands more get a paycheck from jobs created directly or indirectly by the shale gas boom and chemical manufacturing associated with it. Shale gas in the US is no Ponzi scheme, resting on sketchy reserves, as some have recklessly asserted, but a durable economic bonanza that could return energy intensive manufacturing jobs to many communities. In fact, the new gas volumes are so real and enormous that they threaten coal, oil, nuclear and renewable energy. So far, shale gas is co-existing with solar and wind, whose capacity skyrocketed respectively 14 and 2 times since 2008, but is in mortal combat with coal. Cheap natural gas is coal's market nemesis, plunging coal electricity to only 37% of the market in 2012 from 48% in 2008 and causing investors to pull the plug on 150 planned coal-fired power plants. Though Republicans reflexively charge President Obama with a war on coal, Adam Smith's market forces caused coal to lose market share at a rapid pace. Since burning gas emits no lethal soot or sickening toxic metals and about 50% less carbon dioxide than coal, the displacement of coal generation by natural gas slashes the amounts of major air pollutants like mercury, lead, arsenic, soot, and carbon dioxide. America's carbon emissions have dropped 800 million tons since 2007 and are back to 1995 levels, with gas displacing coal and some oil responsible for about half of the total reduction. The carbon benefits of gas will increase as methane rates are cut by increasing green completions and other practices reducing leakage that the US Environmental Protection Agency has mandated in rules taking effect in 2014. One of the major concerns about natural gas is what happens at the local level. Shale gas production is an industrial activity that brings to local areas drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing pumps, trucks, and pipelines as well as lease payments, royalty checks, jobs, and cheap energy. It often creates new local sources of diesel air emissions and drilling waste water whose storage in deep caverns caused an earthquake felt at the surface in Youngstown, Ohio. During the first year of development of any shale well, shale gas is not a quiet, good neighbor, and it brings lasting challenges. I saw the issues first-hand when I was Pennsylvania's environmental secretary as the state's Marcellus Shale drilling took off. Mistakes in the casing and cementing of gas wells caused methane to migrate to 18 water wells in Dimock, Pennsylvania, and five compressor stations have erupted in fire in Pennsylvania just since 2011. Gas drilling must be strongly regulated and reasonably taxed. Rules must be strong, regulatory staff big enough to enforce them, and political leaders must tell their regulators to enforce fully the rules. Excellent regulation can help minimize impacts and maximize benefits, but regulation of gas and energy production is too often poor. Even with the best regulation, gas production cannot be done with no impact on the environment, no trucks, accidents, leaks, spills, land disturbance. Yet, no form of energy production can meet that standard. Virtually all of our energy choices have big safety and environmental risks or significant weaknesses. There is no perfect or excellent energy source that has no environmental impact, is low-cost, and operates continuously. Indeed, especially in terms of the environment, our energy choices today are mostly ugly. Coal production involves blowing up mountains, tearing apart land, burying streams with spoil, discharging acidic waste water that destroys aquatic life, and disposal of gargantuan volumes of ash after combustion. The burning of coal releases big volumes of air pollutants – mercury, lead, arsenic, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and soot. Soot pollution that comes from coal and diesel can be lethal, and is estimated to cause 34,000 premature deaths per year just in America. Oil leaks and spills everyday, fouling streams and groundwater. It's burning releases soot and huge amounts of carbon dioxide as well as other air pollutants. Nuclear power creates the world's most toxic waste stream, until it has a bad day, and then nightmares come true. After Fukushima, more than 1% of the nuclear plants built in the world have melted down, with radiation released at Chernobyl alone responsible for the deaths of about 4,000 people. The two biggest renewable energy sources – corn ethanol and large hydro – pollute and damage as well. Big dams devastate fish migrations around America. Nitrogen and phosphorus run-off from corn fields that feed ethanol plants pollute rivers and cause big dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico. Though growing rapidly, wind and solar provide just 2% of America's total energy, but even wind that causes zero air and water pollution has passionate opponents who hate its visual impacts or loath any bird kills. So which energy source is winning the battle for market share around the world? Oil remains the world's biggest energy source, but coal is closing the gap and could become the world's top fuel. Indeed, last year, coal reached its highest market share of the world's energy in more than 40 years. China, the second biggest and fastest growing economy, gets 70% of its total energy from coal and just 5% from natural gas. Only in America is coal struggling, because the shale gas revolution has made gas cheap and is displacing it here. Coal and oil already provide about 63% of the world's total energy. Their consumption is increasing and is the prime reason why atmospheric carbon concentrations exceed 400 ppm, why air pollution harms millions, and why energy usage pollutes water. In that real world of ugly energy, more energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear power, and natural gas – imperfect as they are – offer big public health benefits. Moreover, in some parts of the world like the US, natural gas is uniquely able to displace quickly and economically huge amounts of coal and oil."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"}]}}
