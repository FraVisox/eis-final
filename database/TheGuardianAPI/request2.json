The meeting was attended by the heads of the armed forces, intelligence agencies, the ministry of defence, the ministry of internal affairs, the Ukrainian security service as well as other defence forces. Russian artillery fired at Ukrainian towns across the river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, local officials said on Sunday. The regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said Russian forces struck residential buildings in the main city of Zaporizhzhia and the town of Orikhiv farther east. Ukraine’s military reported shelling of nine more towns in the area on the opposite side of the Dnieper river from the plant. The UN nuclear watchdog is waiting for clearance for its officials to visit the plant “to help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there”. The Energoatom head, Petro Kotin, told the Guardian a visit from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) could come before the end of the month, but the Ukrainian energy minister, Lana Zerkal, told a local radio station she was not convinced Russia was negotiating in good faith. The US has said Russia does not want to acknowledge the grave radiological risk at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, adding that was the reason it blocked a nuclear non-proliferation treaty deal’s final draft. “The Russian Federation alone decided to block consensus on a final document at the conclusion of the Tenth Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Russia did so in order to block language that merely acknowledged the grave radiological risk at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine,” said a US state department statement. Concern about the potential risk of radiation leaks at the plant persists. Ukrainian and Russian authorities issued fresh warnings about the risk of radioactive leaks, after shelling that the sides blamed on each other. Ukraine’s state energy operator warned there are “risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances”. Russia has ignored widespread international calls for the area to be demilitarised. Ukrainians are likely to experience their coldest winter in decades, its gas chief has said, as the thermostats on its Soviet-era centralised heating systems are set to be switched on later and turned down. Yurii Vitrenko, the head of the state gas company Naftogaz, said indoor temperatures would be set at between 17-18C, about four degrees lower than normal, and he advised people to stock up on blankets and warm clothes for when outdoor temperatures fall to and beyond the -10C winter average. Germany is replenishing its gas stocks more quickly than expected despite drastic Russian supply cuts and should meet an October target early, the government has said. Europe’s largest economy is heavily dependent on Russian gas and has raced to bolster its reserves before winter, crediting energy-saving measures in recent weeks and massive purchases of gas from other suppliers. EU foreign ministers are expected to suspend Russian tourist visa facilitation next week. The EU move falls short of an outright ban but would make getting travel documents significantly more complicated and expensive. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said a ban would lack the necessary support. “I don’t think that to cut the relationship with the Russian civilian population will help and I don’t think that this idea will have the required unanimity,” he told Austria’s ORF TV on Sunday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/10/nuclear-option-is-not-the-best-for-energy-transition-away-from-russian-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-10T18:40:30Z","webTitle":"Nuclear option is not the best for energy transition away from Russian fuels | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/nuclear-option-is-not-the-best-for-energy-transition-away-from-russian-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/10/nuclear-option-is-not-the-best-for-energy-transition-away-from-russian-fuels","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear option is not the best for energy transition away from Russian fuels","bodyText":"Agreed, Russian gas bad – but George Monbiot’s attack on Germany, Europe’s largest economy, seems deeply misplaced (It’s not too late to free ourselves from this idiotic addiction to Russian gas, 9 March). The German energy transition is all about replacing conventional power plants, fissile as well as fossil fuel, with renewables. Looking at both short- and mid-term energy scenarios, Germany decided that the costs and risks of keeping nuclear outweighed the limited benefits. Meanwhile, worldwide, renewables are exponentially ramping up, and nuclear declining. Global renewable electricity capacity is forecast to increase by over 60% between 2020 and 2026, reaching more than 4,800GW. This is equivalent to the current global power capacity of fossil fuels and nuclear combined. And here’s the killer: Russia produces about 35% of the world’s enriched uranium for nuclear reactors, and the EU’s uranium imports from Russia equal those from Niger, at 2,545 tonnes. The Fukushima disaster made Monbiot pro-nuclear and now military attack on nuclear in Ukraine makes him even more so. Good luck with that. Dr Paul Dorfman Associate fellow, Science Policy Research Unit, University of Sussex • What on earth does George Monbiot mean when he refers to small modular reactors as “kinder nuclear technologies”? SMRs are still vulnerable to accidents and attack (think of what happened in Ukraine); they still produce more nuclear waste per unit of electricity than conventional reactors; and there is still no safe, long-term solution for radioactive waste. Additionally, these reactors will remain dependent on uranium for fuel – when we know that uranium mining has caused suffering and death to mainly indigenous people across the world. Rae Street Littleborough, Greater Manchester • George Monbiot makes a convincing argument for “the comprehensive energy transition that should have happened years ago”. He concludes by asking “So what are we waiting for?” We are waiting for another comprehensive transition – from our enslavement to the mysterious deity called “the market”, which also should have happened years ago. John Airs Liverpool • Michael Gove backs a new commission to explore tidal energy (Severn estuary tidal energy plan back on agenda amid Ukraine crisis, 8 March), and reveals a government racked by incompetence. There is already an “oven-ready” Swansea tidal lagoon project, fully costed, and with planning approval. The government failed to back it in 2018. Roger Critchley West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire • Re Larry Elliott’s analysis (West feeling impact of Russia sanctions too as oil and gas prices soar, 7 March), we could reduce consumption of oil, limit our dependency on supplies from Russia and deny revenues to Putin if we reduced speed limits on the roads. When the speed of a petrol-engined car is reduced from 70mph to its optimal speed of 55mph to 60mph, its petrol consumption falls by 17%. Given that demand for road transport fuels in the UK is around 44m litres of petrol and 81m litres of diesel per day, that brings petrol consumption down by 7.5m litres and diesel by 13.8m litres per day. If the Nato allies were to agree such a strategy, they could inflict a sizeable cut in the financial support being provided for Putin’s war. David Walker Sheffield • Regarding your report (Joe Biden bans Russian oil imports in powerful blow to Putin’s war machine, 8 March), imagine if the US had not withdrawn from the Iranian nuclear accord, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA), in 2018. Today, there would be no discussion about oil prices rising to such high levels. Before the withdrawal, Iran was producing 2m to 2.5m barrels a day, with the potential to reach 3.5m to 4m. A return to the JCPOA and the return of Iranian oil to the world markets are vital for a successful grinding down of the Russian economy.

Citing the threat to water supplies in an area officially designated as seriously water stressed, the threats to coastal areas from climate change and environmental damage, the challenge is the first step in a judicial review of the planning consent. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, overruled the independent Planning Inspectorate to grant permission for the new nuclear reactor in Suffolk in July. Kwarteng is pushing ahead with government plans to approve one new nuclear reactor a year as part of an energy strategy that aims to bolster the UK’s nuclear capacity, with the hope that by 2050 up to 25% of projected energy demand will come from it. But Sizewell C has faced stiff opposition from local campaigners, and environmental groups both for its cost and the environmental impact. In a letter to Kwarteng outlining their legal challenge Together Against Sizewell C (TASC) argues that the permission by the government for the plant was given unlawfully. Represented by Leigh Day solicitors and supported by Friends of the Earth, the group says there was a failure to assess the implications of the project as a whole, by ignoring the issue of whether a permanent water supply could be secured, a failure to assess the environmental impact of that project and the suggestion that the site would be clear of nuclear material by 2140, which was not upheld by evidence showing highly radioactive waste would have to be stored on site until a much later date. The Planning Inspectorate had rejected the scheme saying “unless the outstanding water supply strategy can be resolved and sufficient information provided to enable the secretary of state to carry out his obligations under the Habitats Regulations, the case for an order granting development consent for the application is not made out”. Pete Wilkinson, chair of TASC, said: “The case against Sizewell C is overwhelming, as has been carefully documented throughout the inquiry stage and was found by the planning inspector to have merit. “Even to consider building a £20bn-plus nuclear power plant without first securing a water supply is a measure of the fixation this government has for nuclear power and its panic in making progress towards an energy policy which is as unachievable as it is inappropriate for the 21st-century challenges we face.” The risk to UK nuclear facilities from climate change has been outlined by Dr Paul Dorfman, an academic at the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex, and the chair of the Nuclear Consulting Group. He warns the UK’s coastal nuclear facilities are on the frontline of climate breakdown and some may have to be abandoned in the face of the threat. Dorfman said: “It’s clear that the Suffolk coast by the proposed Sizewell C nuclear plant is fragile, vulnerable to erosion and climate-driven storm surge. It looks like the site will be almost entirely cut off by flood water at least once per year, and much sooner than models predict.” Sizewell C is expected to cost £20bn and would be paid for with a surcharge on customer energy bills as well as £1.7bn of taxpayers’ money. Experts on nuclear waste disposal who advise government say no new nuclear plants should be built until a permanent disposal dump has been built. But a site for a permanent waste facility has yet to be identified, and is unlikely to be ready until the late 2040s at the earliest, if there is agreement on where it should be sited. Rowan Smith, the solicitor representing TASC, said: “We are proud to represent TASC in the local community’s continued fight to help protect Suffolk’s heritage coast and wildlife sites. Our client is understandably shocked that the secretary of state has gone against the considered and reasoned view of the independent planning inspectorate and granted development consent in a potentially legally flawed manner. TASC has very real concerns that the environmental impacts of Sizewell C have not been properly assessed. If the secretary of state does not see the error of his ways, then we intend to do all we can to bring this to the court’s attention.” The government said in granting the permission for Sizewell C that a very substantial and urgent need to build the plant outweighed the environmental harms. EDF worked with Chinese state-backed nuclear specialist CGN on the first phase of the project. But the UK government is keen to ease CGN out because of concerns about Chinese involvement in sensitive assets. Boris Johnson’s government has already put up £100m of funding this year to support its development. Bankers at Barclays have been hired to secure new financial backing for the project alongside EDF and the UK government. • This article was amended on 8 August 2022.

This seems to have been mostly spent on supplies of fake blood almost copious enough to run the sprinkler system on Frontier Titan, the 58,000-tonne cargo ship travelling between the Philippines and South Korea in Kim Hong-sun’s film. Forget Con Air; this is Con Sea, with bruiser cop Seok-woo (Park Ho-san) in charge of escorting a dirty dozen or so fugitives back to the motherland. First among evils is Jong-doo (Seo In-guk), a rapist with boyband looks and tattoos up to his jawline, who earns an early beating from Seok-woo after threatening his daughter. It doesn’t take a doctorate in whup-ass studies to guess that the criminals don’t stay in handcuffs for long. But – unbeknown to all but the doctor who keeps sneaking down to the basement – they are not Frontier Titan’s only cargo. Suffice it to say that transporting this thing on the same ship as Korea’s most wanted is the action-movie equivalent of that meme about the nuclear power plant and the spider farm being next to each other. Kim sets up the early square-offs and hijacking with the kind of Bruckheimerian bombast that is becoming a lost art in Hollywood. He makes decent use of the ship’s layout – though spreading the mayhem around a disaster-movie-style ensemble, rather than a single protagonist, means the tension is somewhat diffused. The real main character is gratuitous carnage, already amply supplied by the desperadoes before the third party gets involved. If you’ve ever wanted to see a man beaten to death with his own arm, you’ve come to the right place. The slaughter does start to get monotonous, but the film rallies in its final third as adversaries arrive capable of standing up to the basement boy, including seemingly innocuous-looking felon Do-il (Jang Dong-yoon), and Kim produces a set of pulpy late revelations. By then Die Hard-style precision staging has long since given way to pure Splatterhouse – but what B-movie relish it has. • Project Wolf Hunting is available on the Icon Film Channel on 30 January and in UK cinemas on 3 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/26/russia-ukraine-war-un-determined-to-visit-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-russia-turning-site-into-active-war-zone-says-us-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T17:50:05Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: EU to hold urgent talks over Russian ‘energy war’; Ukraine announces mandatory evacuations – as it happened ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/26/russia-ukraine-war-un-determined-to-visit-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-russia-turning-site-into-active-war-zone-says-us-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/26/russia-ukraine-war-un-determined-to-visit-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-russia-turning-site-into-active-war-zone-says-us-live-news","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: EU to hold urgent talks over Russian ‘energy war’; Ukraine announces mandatory evacuations – as it happened ","bodyText":"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Residents near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine have reportedly been given iodine tablets, amid mounting fears that the fighting around the complex could trigger a catastrophe. It comes after the plant, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, was temporarily disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid after all lines to it were cut on Thursday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” on Thursday when electricity to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant was cut for hours after fires broke out around the plant. The Ukrainian president praised the Ukrainian technicians who operated the plant under the gaze of the Russian military. By Friday afternoon, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, said one of the two working reactors had been reconnected to the grid. The one reactor is building up capacity, the agency said, thanking the plant’s working for “tirelessly and firmly” keeping “the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders”. A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog are poised to make an emergency visit to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, according to reports. Sources have told the Wall Street Journal that it is “almost certain” that a mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will visit the plant early next week, although details are still being completed. EU energy ministers will gather for an urgent meeting as soon as possible to discuss the current energy crisis following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Czech prime minister said. The Czech Republic currently holds the presidency of the European Council. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has announced plans to expand mandatory evacuations for civilians living on the war’s front lines. Speaking on national television, Vereshchuk said evacuating women with children and elderly people would be a priority from some districts of the eastern Kharkiv region and the southern Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv regions. Ukrainian forces have struck an important bridge used by Russian occupying forces in the southern Kherson region, according to Ukraine’s southern military command. The Daryivskiy bridge is the only Russian-controlled crossing across the Inhulets river, which splits the Russian-occupied land west of the Dnipro into two parts. Russia’s claim that it is deliberately slowing the pace of its military campaign in Ukraine is “almost certainly deliberate misinformation”, according to British intelligence. The latest UK Ministry of Defence report said Russia’s offensive has stalled “because of poor Russian military performance and fierce Ukrainian resistance”. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has said his country’s SU-24 warplanes have been re-fitted to carry nuclear armaments. Lukashenko said he had previously agreed the move with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and warned that his country is ready to respond to “serious provocation” from the west instantly. Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas that it would previously have exported to Germany while energy costs soar in Europe, the BBC has reported. According to the broadcaster, which cites an analysis by Rystad Energy, a plant near Russia’s border with Finland is burning an estimated £8.4m-worth of gas every day. The head of the UK’s energy regulator, Ofgem, has blamed Russia for driving up energy prices, resulting in the UK price cap rising by 80%. Ofgem on Friday approved the £1,578 increase on the current price cap of £1,971 for the average dual-fuel tariff. The German ambassador to the UK has acknowledged that there is a risk that public support for Ukraine could wane this winter as the energy crisis intensifies. Vladimir Putin is “using gas as a weapon” in the UK and all of Europe, Miguel Berger said. “He wants to test our resolve”. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. As always, thank you for reading. Ukrainian forces have struck an important bridge used by Russian occupying forces in the southern Kherson region, according to Ukraine’s southern military command. The southern command said in a statement: Rocket artillery units continued to conduct missions, including ensuring control over the Daryivskiy bridge. Its operation is currently halted. The Daryivskiy bridge is the only Russian-controlled crossing across the Inhulets river, which splits the Russian-occupied land west of the Dnipro into two parts, Reuters reports. Residents near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine have reportedly been given iodine tablets, amid mounting fears that the fighting around the complex could trigger a catastrophe. Associated Press reports that the iodine tablets were issued in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia, about 45 kilometres (27 miles) from the plant. Among those who received the pills were a woman and her small daughter, it writes. It comes after the plant, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, was temporarily disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid after all lines to it were cut on Thursday. On Friday morning, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, said efforts were still under way to link it back to the Ukrainian grid before announcing success in the early afternoon with the connection of one of its six reactors. The situation however remains fragile as fighting continues around the plant, with satellite images showing fires around the complex over the last few days. A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog are poised to make an emergency visit to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, according to reports. Sources have told the Wall Street Journal that it is “almost certain” that a mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will visit the plant early next week, although details are still being completed. “Frantic preparations” were underway after a breakthrough in negotiation over access, a person familiar with the matter told the paper. The IAEA team could bring spare parts, radiation-monitoring devices and other vital materials to the plant after it was disconnected for the first time in history. It comes a day after the IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, said the watchdog was “very, very close” to being able to go to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The WSJ reports that Russia’s opposition to the IAEA’s visit has allegedly softened, allowing Grossi to lead a delegation that will travel to the plant across Ukrainian territory and spend at least one night at the facility. The mission will seek to assess the safety of the plant and address any security problems that have emerged during the fighting. Boris Johnson has condemned Russia’s “cultural vandalism” in Ukraine and vowed that the UK will fund “cultural protection measures” as well as continue to donate civil and military aid to the country. Russian troops are trying to erase Ukrainian culture in areas they have taken over, the British prime minister said in a video message to the Edinburgh International Culture Summit. Johnson said: Throughout history, we’ve seen what happens when aggressors try to oppress and to eliminate culture. We saw it with the Nazis in the Second World War, the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, the Taliban in Afghanistan. Today, the world is once again witnessing unforgivable acts of cultural vandalism, this time in Ukraine. He accused the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of “systematically erasing all traces of the centuries-old Ukrainian culture from the territory his troops occupy”. The UK will fund “cultural heritage protection measures” as well as military and humanitarian aid, he said. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has announced plans to expand mandatory evacuations for civilians living on the war’s front lines, Reuters reports. Speaking on national television, Vereshchuk said evacuating women with children and elderly people would be a priority from some districts of the eastern Kharkiv region and the southern Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv regions. She said: I’m not talking about the entire regions, but some parts will require mandatory evacuation and we are preparing for it. She urged residents not to resist and warned they also faced the threat of Russian occupation, adding: If they stay there, people will suffer, especially children. In July, the Ukrainian government launched a campaign of mandatory evacuations for people in the eastern Donetsk region that it began implementing this month. Ukrainian-controlled districts and towns in the industrial east are under constant shelling from Russian and pro-Russian forces. Vereshchuk said: I know very well what the enemy can do to force people to collaborate. That’s why I call on people to evacuate so often and not to hope for the enemy to show mercy and … to follow international humanitarian law. This will not happen. EU energy ministers will gather for an urgent meeting as soon as possible to discuss the current energy crisis following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Czech prime minister said. The Czech presidency “will convene an urgent meeting of energy ministers to discuss specific emergency measures to address the energy situation,” its prime minister, Petr Fiala, announced. The Czech Republic currently holds the presidency of the European Council. The country’s minister of industry and trade, Jozef Síkela, earlier tweeted: We are in an energy war with Russia and it is damaging the whole European Union. It’s just past 5:15pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” on Thursday when electricity to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant was cut for hours after fires broke out around the plant. Back-up diesel generators ensured power supply that was vital for cooling and safety systems at the plant, the Ukrainian president said, praising the Ukrainian technicians who operated the plant under the gaze of the Russian military. By Friday afternoon, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, said one of the two working reactors had been reconnected to the grid. The one reactor is building up capacity, the agency said, thanking the plant’s working for “tirelessly and firmly” keeping “the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders”.

Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here to bring you all the latest from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. An ONS survey has suggested that many Ukrainians who have come to the UK are struggling to find work because their qualifications are not recognised and due to language difficulties. PA Media reports: Most who have fled the war in their homeland to come to Britain do not know how to access benefits or alter their visas now they have arrived, the findings also indicate, as well as revealing how some feel nervous, anxious or depressed. Experimental research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) questioned a sample of adults who had arrived in the UK by mid-April under Ukraine visa schemes. Some 1,132 people took part in the online survey between July 20 and August 4, which was a follow-up questionnaire to the first of its kind carried out earlier this year. The majority of respondents (93%) were still in the UK but 7% had left since April and the results were based on those who remained in the country at the time of the latest survey. Hugh Stickland, from the ONS, said: “More Ukrainian nationals have now had time to find work since they first arrived in the UK. “However, while a majority of those that aren’t working said they are likely or very likely to look for work, many are struggling to find work due to their qualifications gained abroad not being recognised by UK employers or who are struggling with the English language requirements.” The proportion of Ukrainian nationals employed in the UK has increased to 42% since the first survey and more respondents than before (37%) said they had enough money to support themselves for the next three months. But almost half of the people who took part in the survey (47%) had “experienced some barriers to being able to take up work in the UK”, with the most common reason being because English language skills were not meeting the job requirements (58%). Over half (51%) of respondents, however, indicated they could speak English well or very well. For reading and writing, this was 63% and 51%, respectively. Of those with a qualification gained outside the UK, 43% indicated that UK employers had generally not recognised their qualifications when applying for jobs. According to the findings, most respondents said they did not understand very well or at all well how to apply to extend or change their visa (69%), or what state benefits they may be eligible for (58%). Around one in five (21%) respondents reported feeling nervous, anxious or on edge for more than half the days or nearly every day in the fortnight before filling out the survey. Some 16% reported feeling down, depressed or hopeless for more than half the days or nearly every day in that period. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been occupied by Russia, resumed electricity supplies to Ukraine on Friday after one of its six reactors was reconnected to the Ukrainian grid, state nuclear company Energoatom said. Reuters reports: More than 18,000 people in 72 settlements in Zaporizhzhia region were without electricity as of Friday due to damage caused to powers lines, the regional administration said, without specifying which lines it was talking about. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said Russian shelling had sparked fires on Thursday in the ash pits of a nearby coal power station that disconnected the reactor complex from the power grid. Russia’s defence ministry blamed Ukraine, saying its forces had destroyed the Ukrainian gun responsible. Workers at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine have been hailed as “heroes” after Europe’s largest nuclear power plant was disconnected from the country’s power grid for the first time in its history. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, has now said one of the two working reactors had been reconnected to the grid. An administrative worker at the plant told CNN earlier today that “everything is already ok”. The plant employee, who has not been named, said: Yesterday there was no electricity, no water, nothing. But everything is already ok, the men [operational staff] at the NPP [Nuclear Power Plant] are just smarties and heroes. They added that with “shelling around the station and the city, smoke from fires, dust from the ash dump of a thermal power plant”, that the “situation sometimes looks like the end of the world” at the plant. A group of lawmakers from Germany’s Social Democratic party (SPD) are calling for peace negotiations with Russia and for a ceasefire to be reached in Ukraine as soon as possible. In a letter entitled “The guns must be silent!” seen by Der Spiegel, the group representing the pacifist left-wing of the SPD urged for a diplomatic offensive to end the war in Ukraine quickly. They called for a new attempt at a “modus vivendi”, in which conflicting parties agree to coexist in peace, arguing that such a relationship “must be found with the Russian government based on the acknowledgment of realities that one does not like, which rules out a further escalation of the war”. The group propose China act as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine, oppose rearmament plans and warned against the delivery of heavy military equipment to Ukraine, citing the danger of nuclear war. The letter reads: With every delivery of weapons, it is important to carefully weigh up and consider where the ‘red line’ lies, which could be perceived as entering the war and provoke corresponding reactions. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been reconnected to the grid, according to the country’s state nuclear company. Energoatom said one reactor at the plant has been reconnected to the grid and that it was building up capacity, Reuters reports. In a statement, the company said: Today … at 14:04, one of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant’s power units that shut down yesterday was connected to the power grid. Ukraine’s nuclear company thanked the workers at the plant, saying: They tirelessly and firmly hold the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders and work selflessly so that their native country has life-giving electricity. Representatives from Turkey, Finland and Sweden are expected to meet in Finland today to discuss Turkish concerns about the Nordic pair’s Nato accession, Reuters reports. Finland’s foreign ministry remained tight-lipped about the meeting, refusing to provide details about its location or timing. Speaking to the public broadcaster YLE, Finland’s foreign ministry state secretary, Jukka Salovaara, said: This is a matter of security. If we would tell where Turkey’s high officials are at which time, it would give quite a careless picture of us. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, had earlier said that the first meeting between officials would aim to establish contacts and set goals for cooperation that the three countries had agreed to at Nato’s Madrid summit earlier this year. In June, on the eve of the alliance’s summit in Madrid, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, agreed to lift deal-breaking objections to Sweden and Finland’s Nato accession. A trilateral deal was reached between Erdoğan, President Sauli Niinistö of Finland and the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, who signed a memorandum that addressed Turkey’s concerns, including around arms exports and the fight against terrorism. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has said his country’s SU-24 warplanes have been re-fitted to carry nuclear armaments. According to the Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta, Lukashenko said he had previously agreed the move with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Belarus is ready to respond to “serious provocation” from the west instantly, Lukashenko warned. He said: If god forbid some serious provocation against Belarus happens, our targets have been locked in. Decision-making centers. We know them. Relations with Belarus “must not be aggravated because it also means aggravating relations with the Union State of Belarus and Russia that has nuclear weapons”, he said. He added: If they start making problems, Belarus may be worse off but the answer will be instantaneous. Belarus does not have its own nuclear weapons but is an ally of Russia and has allowed its territory to be used for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again to bring you all the latest developments on the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Whether you’re just joining us or need a quick refresher on today’s developments, here’s a quick round-up: Shelling temporarily disconnected the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from Ukraine’s grid. Fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Russian-held plant on Thursday, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation, the country’s nuclear power firm, Energoatom, said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” as the last regular line supplying electricity to the Zaporizhzhia plant in southern Ukraine was restored hours after being cut by shelling. Ukraine has begun trying to restart operations at two reactors at Zaporizhzhia, Reuters reports, citing comments by regional governor Oleksandr Starukh. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said the UN nuclear watchdog could travel to the Zaporizhzhia plant in the “coming days”. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, earlier said his team were “very, very close” to being able to go to the plant. The White House called on Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant, after the US president, Joe Biden, spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas that it would previously have exported to Germany while energy costs soar in Europe, the BBC has reported. According to the broadcaster, which cites an analysis by Rystad Energy, a plant near Russia’s border with Finland is burning an estimated £8.4m-worth of gas every day. The head of the UK’s energy regulator, Ofgem, has blamed Russia for driving up energy prices, resulting in the UK price cap rising by 80%. Ofgem on Friday approved the £1,578 increase on the current price cap of £1,971 for the average dual-fuel tariff. Ukraine has begun trying to restart operations at two reactors at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Reuters reports, citing comments by regional governor Oleksandr Starukh. The plant’s sixth reactor is operating at 10% capacity, while the fifth reactor is in the process of resuming operations, he said in televised comments. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, said the plant’s own needs were being supplied through a power line from Ukraine’s electricity system after it was disconnected from the grid when fires broke out around the plant on Thursday. Turkey’s finance minister has told businesses they should not be worried by threats of sanctions that the US has said will follow if they trade with sanctioned Russians. US deputy secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo told Turkish banks and companies in a letter that they would face secondary sanctions if they worked with sanctioned Russians. In comments representing Turkey’s first official response, Nureddin Nebati tweeted that the letter should not “cause concern in our business circles. Turkey is one of the most important political and economic power centres in the world”. The Nato member has tried to stay neutral in the war and refused to join the international sanctions. Nebati said Turkey was “determined to develop our commercial relations with our neighbours in various sectors – especially tourism – within a framework that is not subject to sanctions”. The German ambassador to the UK has acknowledged that there is a risk that public support for Ukraine could wane this winter as the energy crisis intensifies. Asked if Germany was worried that political support for Ukraine would decline amid tough conditions in winter, Miguel Berger said: I think this is the same challenge here in the UK, for France, for all of Europe. The way Putin is using gas as a weapon and putting pressure on our societies – he wants to test our resolve. Obviously it will depend a lot on the relief packages of our governments. He said the German government has started early, giving grants to companies, direct payments to households, and discussions with trade unions and employers. But he acknowledged that “there is a risk” that support would wane. My colleagues Isobel Koshiw and Emma Graham-Harrison in Kyiv have more on the ongoing concern about the nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhia: Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is still disconnected from the grid after fires broke out around the plant on Thursday. Ukrainian authorities and international experts are increasingly warning that there may be a nuclear catastrophe unless fighting around the plant desists. Problems with the electricity supply to the plant appear to be unresolved as of this morning. The plant was disconnected twice on Thursday when the blaze affected the fourth and last connection into the plant’s reactors. Three other lines had already been taken out because of the war. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, said that work was under way to restore the plant’s connection to the grid and the plant’s own needs were being supplied through a power line from Ukraine’s electricity system. Energoatom said it could not comment on Friday on the security systems or the operations of the equipment. On Thursday, it said they had information that they were working normally. The nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, relies on electricity to keep its reactors cool. During an outage, the plant still received supplies of electricity from one remaining backup line connected to the nearby conventional power plant, Energoatom said. There were three of these lines before the war, but two have been cut. If all external connections go down, it must rely on diesel-fuelled generators for power. If they break down, engineers only have 90 minutes to stave off dangerous overheating. Satellite images published by Ukraine’s Radio Liberty show plumes of smoke rising up near the plant. Germans must start saving energy now in order to prepare for gas shortages this winter, the UK ambassador to the country has said. Asked about whether it is wise to look for new energy deals with “autocratic leaders”, Miguel Berger said: “There is no other option but to look elsewhere, but at the same time we try to speed up as much as possible the energy transition – currently half of our electricity comes from renewable energy but obviously this is not a short-term solution. That’s why we have a discussion on nuclear and we have a discussion on reconnecting – only as a very temporary measure – some coal plants.” He said government measures such as lowering temperatures in office buildings and banning heated pools “should give an example to people that they have to take the measures to save energy”. “There is no way around, half of our heating in Germany is from gas. The best way to have gas for the winter is to start saving it as early as possible.” Germany is facing similar challenges to the UK as Vladimir Putin “tests the resolve” of western nations, Germany’s ambassador to the UK has said. Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas that it would previously have exported to Germany amid soaring energy costs, the BBC has reported. Speaking to the Today programme, Miguel Berger said: “We have been observing these flares for quite a while it shows the measures we have taken so far which means we have reduced gas consumption from Russia from over 50% to about 10% is having a strong economy, because they don’t have other places where they can sell their gas so they have to burn it.” Asked about the environmental implications of a temporary shift to coal, Berger said: “We are speaking here about absolute emergency measures – let me say that the challenges you have been describing, with the increase of the price cap [in the UK] is very similar to what we have in Germany, we are all facing the same challenges. We should not forget that Putin is really testing the resolve of western countries.” The head of the UK’s energy regulator, Ofgem, has blamed Russia for driving up energy prices, resulting in the UK price cap rising by 80%. Ofgem on Friday approved the £1,578 increase on the current price cap of £1,971 for the average dual-fuel tariff. The new cap will be introduced in October, and comes after the price cap was increased in April from £1,277 to £1,971. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley told Sky News: “This year … we have seen the slow and deliberate cut-off of gas by Russia to the European market, and that has made prices spike, much, much further.” He said this came after economies grew post-Covid, particularly in Asia, putting pressure on the gas market. The Ofgem boss said winter gas prices were 15 times higher than usual, and were equivalent to paying £400 to £500 to fill up a car with petrol. Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas that it would previously have exported to Germany while energy costs soar in Europe, the BBC has reported. According to BBC News, which cites an analysis by Rystad Energy, a plant near Russia’s border with Finland is burning an estimated £8.4m-worth of gas every day. Scientists are concerned about the quantities of carbon dioxide and soot the new liquified natural gas (LNG) plant at Portovaya, north-west of St Petersburg, is creating. The plant is near a compressor station at the start of the Nordstream 1 pipeline, which transports gas to Germany. Finnish citizens reported seeing a large flame earlier this summer, and researchers have reported a significant increase in heat coming from the facility. While gas flaring is a normal process used in industry, the scale at which gas is being burned at the plant was unprecedented, researchers said. “I’ve never seen an LNG plant flare so much,” Dr Jessica McCarty, an expert on satellite data from Miami University in Ohio, told the broadcaster. “Starting around June, we saw this huge peak, and it just didn’t go away. It’s stayed very anomalously high.” All six reactors of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine are still disconnected from Ukraine’s electricity grid, Reuters reports, citing state nuclear company Energoatom. However, the company said there were currently no issues with the plant’s machinery or its safety systems. Energoatom said electricity for the plant’s own needs was being supplied through a power line from Ukraine’s electricity system. It comes after fires, caused by shelling, cut the last remaining power line to the plant on Thursday, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Blackmail is the “hallmark of modern Russia”, an adviser to Ukraine’s defence ministry has said, describing Moscow’s leveraging of energy and nuclear power. Speaking about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which normally supplies Ukraine with a fifth of its energy, Yuriy Sak said: “Russia is using the tactics of blackmailing Ukraine as well as other international partners of Ukraine into trying to negotiate some favourable deals in the future. The tactics of blackmail – nuclear blackmail, energy blackmail – these are the hallmarks of the Russian of the modern Russia. “We understand it very well and we hope that the international community will stand firm in not budging to the Russian tactic of blackmailing.” Russian soldiers must leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in order to guarantee safety, an adviser to Ukraine’s defence minister has said. Appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Yuriy Sak said that since the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was captured by Russian soldiers in March, it has been controlled by them but run by Ukrainian personnel. “Our personnel is trying everything they can in the circumstances to ensure it functions uninterruptedly … The power plant poses a risk to the whole of Europe.” Asked about updates on whether Russia will allow international inspectors on to the plant site, he said: “We have claims by the Russian side that they will allow this inspection – we hope that they honour that commitment but the ultimate solution is not just admitting the inspection … the ultimate solution is the complete demilitarisation of the nuclear plant, [and] making sure that the Russian soldiers leave Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. This will be the only guarantee that nothing major happens.” Russia blames the Ukrainian military for strikes in the area. Switzerland is bracing for power shortages this winter due to its reliance on Russian gas and French nuclear power, AFP reports. The country relies on hydropower in the summer months but turns to imports at other times. With Russia slashing gas deliveries, Switzerland is particularly vulnerable as it lacks its own gas storage installations. Exacerbating the issue, France has been forced to halt production at half of its reactors, mainly due to corrosion problems. The Swiss government but has said it is readying the country for power shortages, with the head of the federal electricity commission, Werner Luginbuhl, warning of repeated, hours-long power cuts. Hello, I’m Clea Skopeliti and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments from the war in Ukraine for the next few hours. You can reach me via email, or send me a DM on Twitter, when I’m @cleaskopeliti. It’s 9.15am in Kyiv. When Mikhail Sokolov signed up to work for the FSB security services, he never imagined his journey would end here: in a crowded refugee camp on the outskirts of a sleepy town in the rural Netherlands. “The last six years were a rollercoaster. I am happy I am no longer in the claws of the FSB,” the former FSB informant and staffer for the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s anti-corruption network said in an interview with the Guardian this week. The 25-year-old is now living in a crowded dormitory, shunned by fellow activists, while being trolled online by his former FSB handlers. Sokolov’s story shines a rare light on the inner workings of Moscow’s secretive security services and their attempts to infiltrate the Russian opposition at home and abroad. He is part of what appears to be a trend of ex-FSB informers coming clean after Moscow’s decision to invade Ukraine. “I am convinced there were hundreds of us,” Sokolov said, sitting at a cafe near the refugee centre in the south of the Netherlands. “Nearly every organised opposition group had an informer at low or mid-level.” Read the full story below. Ukraine’s capital renamed 95 streets on Thursday as part of a drive to purge Russian and Soviet place names, Kyiv’s mayor announced a day after Ukraine marked 31 years of independence. Since Russia invaded in February, Ukraine has accelerated what it calls “derussification”, a campaign to shed the legacy of hundreds of years of rule by Moscow. Kyiv mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, said: [The new names] should perpetuate the memory of significant historical events of Ukraine, as well as famous figures and heroes who glorified Ukraine and fought for the independence of our state.” One street was named after London while another was dubbed “Ukrainian rebirth street.” Another street, previously bearing the surname of a Soviet defence minister, was renamed after Ukraine’s Azov regiment. Russia’s claim that it is deliberately slowing the pace of its military campaign in Ukraine is “almost certainly deliberate misinformation”, according to British intelligence. Earlier in the week, the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, told the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation that Russia was slowing its campaign to reduce casualties. It is also highly likely that Shoigu and Russian president Vladimir Putin have fired at least six generals for not advancing quickly enough, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. Russia’s offensive has stalled because of poor Russian military performance and fierce Ukrainian resistance. Under Shoigu’s orders, the forces operating in Ukraine have repeatedly missed planned operational timelines.” Russia and its proxy forces in Ukraine are operating 21 locations used to detain, interrogate and process prisoners of war and civilians, according to a new report by Yale University researchers backed by the US state department. The Conflict Observatory report cites commercial satellite imagery and open-source information to identify with ‘high confidence’ the separate locations - including facilities that previously served as schools, markets and regular prisons. It also identifies possible graves at one prison complex. A Conflict Observatory hub that analyses evidence of Russian war crimes released a report on Thursday which they say provides proof of forced deportation and filtration camps in Ukraine. The Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health that produced the report is a partner in a US state department-funded Conflict Observatory launched in May to capture and analyse evidence of war crimes and other atrocities allegedly perpetrated by Russia in Ukraine. Nathaniel Raymond, the lab’s executive director, said the findings showed Russia and its proxies had established a “system of filtration” to sort people in areas that fall under Russian occupation that represents a “human rights emergency.” Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of deporting hundreds of thousands of people from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. Thursday’s report focused on Donetsk region, where Russia and its proxy the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic took control of most of the city of Mariupol in March. The city’s mayor said in April that about 40,000 civilians from the city had been forcibly moved into Russian-controlled territory or taken to Russia. The report identified a system that brings in civilians in conflict-affected areas, puts them through registration and interrogation before they are either released, kept in detention, or transported to Russia. Outgoing British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has reportedly received a discount card for any future trips taken on Ukrainian trains. A photo of Johnson shared by Ukrainian media outlets shows the PM holding a loyalty card “Ukrzaliznytsia” number 001. Negotiations are under way for the UN’s nuclear watchdog to visit the site, and Ukraine’s top nuclear official told the Guardian that IAEA inspectors could arrive by the end of the month. The IAEA said Ukraine had informed it the plant temporarily lost connection, “further underlining the urgent need for an IAEA expert mission to travel to the facility”. We can’t afford to lose any more time. I’m determined to personally lead an IAEA mission to the plant in the next few days,” the organisation’s director general, Rafael Grossi, said. Zelenskiy also urged: The IAEA and other international organisations must act much faster than they’re acting now. Because every minute the Russian troops stay at the nuclear power plant is a risk of a global radiation disaster.” At least 25 people have been confirmed dead after a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian train station. Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday. The deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. Russia has since confirmed it was behind the attack. The US has condemned any Russian bid to divert energy from Ukraine where authorities said the vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was cut off from its national grid. State department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters: The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine and any attempt to disconnect the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and redirect to occupied areas is unacceptable. No country should turn a nuclear power plant into an active war zone and we oppose any Russian efforts to weaponise or divert energy from the plant.” Ukraine earlier said that Zaporizhzhia - the largest nuclear facility in Europe - for the first time was severed form its national grid after fighting around the complex. President Joe Biden, in a telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for Russia to return full control of the plant and let in UN nuclear inspectors, the White House said. Bonnie Jenkins, the under secretary of state for arms control, said Moscow bore responsibility for the plant’s safety. “Their actions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have created a serious risk of a nuclear incident - a dangerous radiation release - that could threaten not only the people and environment of Ukraine but also affect neighbouring countries and the entire international community,” Jenkins told reporters. “The risk of radiation release could be all but eliminated if Russia returns control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant back to Ukraine and fully withdraws from Ukraine’s sovereign territory,” she said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” as the last regular line supplying electricity to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was restored hours after being cut by shelling. The Ukranian president said officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, must be given urgent access to the site. Zelenskiy blamed shelling on Thursday by Russia’s military for fires in the ash pits of a nearby coal power station that disconnected the reactor complex, Europe’s largest such facility, from the power grid. He said back-up diesel generators ensured power supply and kept the plant safe. Addressing the nation on Wednesday evening, he said: Today, for the first time in history, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant stopped. The emergency protection of the power units worked - after the last working line of the plant’s power return to the Ukrainian power system was damaged by Russian shelling. If our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident. Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster.” IAEA officials should be given access to the site within days, he said, “before the occupiers take the situation to the point of no return”. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. It is 7.30am in Kyiv. Here is where we stand: Shelling temporarily disconnected the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from Ukraine’s grid. Fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the plant on Thursday, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation, the country’s nuclear power firm, Energoatom, said. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said the UN nuclear watchdog could travel to the Zaporizhzhia plant in the “coming days”. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, earlier said his team were “very, very close” to being able to go to the plant. The White House called on Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant, after the US president, Joe Biden, spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Biden congratulated him on the country’s 31st independence day, celebrated on Wednesday. Zelenskiy said he had “a great conversation” and thanked Biden for his “unwavering” support. It comes a day after Biden announced nearly $3bn in new military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment, the biggest tranche of US military aid to date. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, as the war in Ukraine enters its seventh month with no signs of abating. The Russian president’s decree appears to point to the country’s aim to replenish its military, which has been heavily damaged in Ukraine and has failed to achieve its objective to capture the capital, Kyiv. At least 25 people have been confirmed dead after a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian train station. Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday. The deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. Russia has since confirmed it was behind the attack. The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has said a building allegedly used by Russian-backed officials in the region has been “blown up”. Fedorov, who is not in the city, posted a video reportedly showing damage to the building, which he said was being used to plan a “pseudo-referendum” by Russia-backed authorities on whether the region should join Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/10/edf-sues-french-government-for-7bn-after-forced-to-sell-energy-at-a-loss-macron-price-cap","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-10T11:28:32Z","webTitle":"EDF sues French government for £7bn after being forced to sell energy at a loss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/10/edf-sues-french-government-for-7bn-after-forced-to-sell-energy-at-a-loss-macron-price-cap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/10/edf-sues-french-government-for-7bn-after-forced-to-sell-energy-at-a-loss-macron-price-cap","fields":{"headline":"EDF sues French government for £7bn after being forced to sell energy at a loss","bodyText":"The French nuclear company EDF is suing its own government for €8.3bn (£7bn) after it was forced to sell energy to consumers at a loss. The company, which is being nationalised by the French state, has filed a compensation claim over the extension of the country’s price cap in January. Emmanuel Macron’s government forced EDF to sell more of its power to rivals at prices below the market rates as officials attempted to tackle the cost of living crisis and support households. The energy company has to sell electricity to rivals at a heavy discount as a counterbalance to its monopoly position. French officials increased the cap on the discount by a fifth in January, hitting its finances. EDF said the move meant it had to sell energy at a loss. In the claim, filed at the French administrative supreme court, the Conseil d’Etat, it said losses have totalled €8.3bn “estimated to date”, implying that the measure could cost the company more than €15bn over the year. The nuclear energy giant had previously estimated the administrative changes could cost between €7.7bn and €8.4bn. It posted its largest ever half-year loss last month, notching up €5.3bn, compared with a profit of €4.2bn a year earlier. EDF is 84% owned by the French government and last month officials revealed plans to buy the remaining 16% for €12 a share, working out at an estimated total of €9.7bn. The government hopes nationalising the debt-laden company will help secure energy supplies in the country after the war in Ukraine left countries hunting for new sources of power to replace Russian imports. Last month, an association of EDF employee shareholders said it planned to sue the French state over its nationalisation plans, arguing that the decision goes against the interest of the company and the minority shareholders. EDF, which is developing the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset, is already tackling problems with its nuclear plants in France. The power stations typically provide nearly 70% of France’s electricity but this is expected to hit a three-decade low this year due to a string of technical and maintenance issues. The heatwave sweeping Europe has also caused problems – EDF last week said it was temporarily reducing output at its nuclear power stations on the Rhône and Garonne rivers as hot weather pushes up river temperatures, restricting its ability to use river water to cool the plants. On Monday, France’s nuclear power regulator extended temporary waivers allowing five of the company’s power stations to continue discharging hot water into rivers. In the UK, EDF closed the Hinkley Point B power station in Somerset after 46 years of operation this month. The Hinkley Point C development has been delayed and is over-budget, while the company’s plans to develop a sister power station at Sizewell C in Suffolk received planning approval last month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/19/russia-no-longer-has-full-control-of-luhansk-as-ukraine-recaptures-village","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-19T16:34:33Z","webTitle":"Russia no longer has full control of Luhansk region after Ukraine captures village","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/19/russia-no-longer-has-full-control-of-luhansk-as-ukraine-recaptures-village","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/19/russia-no-longer-has-full-control-of-luhansk-as-ukraine-recaptures-village","fields":{"headline":"Russia no longer has full control of Luhansk region after Ukraine captures village","bodyText":"Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region, one of Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Ukraine’s armed forces were in “complete control” of Bilohorivka. “It’s a suburb of Lysychansk. Soon we will drive these scumbags out of there with a broom,” he said. “Step by step, centimetre by centimetre, we will liberate our entire land from the invaders.” Video footage shared on Telegram showed Ukrainian soldiers patrolling on foot down a ruined street. Russian forces had occupied all of Luhansk province for the past two and a half months. After a long and grinding battle, Ukraine’s general staff decided to retreat in July from the cities of Sievierdonetsk and Lysychansk. Over the past 12 days, Ukrainian regiments in the north-east have mounted a stunning counteroffensive, liberating more than 300 settlements across the Kharkiv region and forcing Russian units to flee in disarray. The reclaimed area is half the size of Wales, and goes right up to the Russian border. There were unconfirmed reports on Monday of Ukrainian troops advancing into Lysychansk. There now seems little prospect that the Kremlin will be able to take control of the whole of the Donbas, which includes Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. In March, Putin said this was the goal of his “special military operation” in Ukraine, after his failed attempt to seize the capital, Kyiv. Over the weekend, Russian troops shelled the city of Kupiansk from new, hastily constructed defensive positions just east of the Oskil River. Hundreds of people were evacuated. Ukraine said it took control of all of the city on Friday, crossing in amphibious vehicles over a pontoon bridge to the river’s left bank. Ukrainian officials say 200 Russian soldiers died in a strike on Sunday when a missile hit a former bus shelter where they were based, in the frontline city of Svatove. According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia has failed to send reinforcements. It is now under pressure and vulnerable to a further counteroffensive, the thinktank said. Governor Haidai said the leaders of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic were beginning to panic. There have been numerous reports of snatch squads detaining men on the street and drafting them into the army. Mobile communications and the internet have been jammed, to prevent people from learning about Moscow’s military setbacks, he claimed. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Kremlin on Monday of reckless behaviour after a shell landed 300 metres from a nuclear power plant in the southern Mykolaiv region. The missile damaged buildings and blew out windows. Three power lines were temporarily knocked out at the Pivdennoukrainsk facility. Ukraine’s state nuclear company, Energoatom, said all three of its nuclear reactors were working normally and had not been damaged. “Fortunately, there were no casualties among the station staff,” it said. The agency published two photographs showing a large crater that it said was caused by the blast. “They forgot what a nuclear power plant is. Russia endangers the whole world. We have to stop it before it’s too late,” Zelenskiy wrote on his Telegram channel. He has previously accused Putin of nuclear terrorism and blackmail and has called on the international community to intervene. The Mykolaiv region has been under constant rocket attack by Russian forces since the start of the invasion. Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive to liberate the nearby city of Kherson. It has made slower progress than in the Kharkiv region, across a flat steppe terrain and with Russian units dug in. Another Ukrainian nuclear power plant, at Zaporizhzhia – which is Europe’s largest and lies about 155 miles (250km) east of the Mykolaiv site – was shut down this month owing to Russian shelling, prompting concerns about a possible nuclear disaster. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is held by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff. The shelling has damaged buildings and disrupted power lines. The UN nuclear watchdog said this weekend that one of the four main power lines at Zaporizhzhia had been repaired and was once again supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid. Russia soldiers have used the territory to shell the Ukrainian-controlled cities of Nikopol and Marhanets across the Dnieper River. More than 40 countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency have urged Putin to hand control of the station back to Ukraine. Invasion by Luke Harding (Guardian Faber, £20).

In his budget speech, the chancellor confirmed plans to spend the money over the next two decades on carbon capture and low carbon energy projects; announced a competition to co-fund small nuclear plants and launched a consultation to classify nuclear as “environmentally sustainable”. The government has created Great British Nuclear, a body designed to ease the creation of nuclear projects which are regularly delayed and over budget, and set a target for nuclear to “provide up to one quarter of our electricity by 2050”. Hunt, who has been under pressure to respond to Joe Biden’s $369bn (£306bn) of climate subsidies, said: “Increasing nuclear capacity is vital to meet our net zero obligations.” However, climate campaigners attacked the drive, which had no giveaways for the solar or wind industries. Ami McCarthy, Greenpeace UK’s political campaigner, said: “This misguided budget shows the stranglehold fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies have on this government. Why else would it take such a dangerous gamble on unproven technologies? “Squandering taxpayers’ money on nuclear reactors that don’t even exist yet and fanciful carbon capture is irresponsible, and does nothing to reduce our emissions now. “Committing to £20bn over 20 years is frankly pathetic compared to the green growth investments being made in the US, EU and China.” Helen Clarkson, chief executive of Climate Group, said: “This spring budget overlooks cheap and clean renewable energy, and instead rebrands nuclear as ‘environmentally sustainable’ and throws cash at carbon capture technology. This was a missed opportunity to renew the UK’s commitment to climate leadership.” Senior nuclear industry figures said the reclassification would help attract investors to fund the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, which the government has committed £700m towards. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, called the move a “huge step forward for UK energy security and net zero”. But Stuart Murphy, founder of tidal energy specialist TPGen24, said: “There is nothing environmentally sustainable about a finite resource which leaves a legacy of hazardous waste.” Britain’s energy industry has been under the spotlight since the war in Ukraine pushed already-high oil and gas prices higher. On Wednesday, Hunt confirmed a widely expected U-turn in on a planned cut to energy support for households. He also said that from July, 4m households on prepayment meters will see their bills aligned with those on direct debits, who currently pay less. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said it expected to see taxes brought in from oil and gas firms for 2022-23 quadruple on last year to £11bn, representing just a fifth of the £55bn in annual global profits of British energy giants BP and Shell. The government introduced a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators last May. The OBR said falling wholesale gas prices meant it had cut its forecasts by £4bn this year, and £10bn next year, compared with forecasts made in November. The OBR also said it expects the bailout of Bulb to cost a further £3bn “but much of that cost is ultimately likely to be recouped” over an uncertain timeframe following the sale of the bust energy supplier to Octopus Energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/19/ukraine-fears-russian-plan-to-cut-power-from-captured-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T01:29:33Z","webTitle":"Macron calls Putin over fears Russia is weaponising captured nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/ukraine-fears-russian-plan-to-cut-power-from-captured-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/19/ukraine-fears-russian-plan-to-cut-power-from-captured-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Macron calls Putin over fears Russia is weaponising captured nuclear plant","bodyText":"France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has said Russia may plan to decouple the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from the Ukrainian power grid, backing up warnings from Ukraine’s own nuclear power firm. Macron spoke to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Friday and said the call was necessary because of the urgent nuclear threat to Europe. Putin agreed to allow independent inspectors to go to the plant, Macron’s office said, and had “reconsidered” allowing the mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency to travel to the facility from Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian nuclear firm Energoatom said on Friday that it feared that Russia plans to switch off the functioning power units at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which in normal times provides about one-fifth of Ukraine’s electricity. Russia has controlled the plant in south-east Ukraine since March, although it is still run by Ukrainian scientists. If it stopped generating electricity, its technicians would have to rely on backup power systems to continue cooling the nuclear reactors, which raises the risk of accidents. “The Russian military is looking for suppliers of fuel for diesel generators, which must be turned on after the shutdown of power units and in the absence of external power supply for nuclear-fuel cooling systems,” Energoatom said. Western officials said they were concerned about whether water cooling could be maintained, amid accusations that the invaders are not properly maintaining the site. “[It is] a situation we should all be watching very closely,” said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. A loss of electricity supply led to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Main power was lost in an earthquake, a tsunami that followed overwhelmed backup generators, and the lack of cooling led to a partial reactor meltdown. Russia has controlled the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe, since March and stationed troops and military equipment there, leading to urgent calls for it to be demilitarised, including from the UN and Nato. The western official said fighting around the plant was considered a lesser risk than a cooling failure, because the nuclear reactors are designed to withstand relatively heavy impact, including that from a passenger jet. On Friday Putin renewed Russian accusations that Ukraine was shelling the site, and in the phone call with Macron he said it could lead to “a large-scale catastrophe that could lead to radiation contamination of vast territories”, the Kremlin said in a statement. Ukrainian military intelligence had warned this week that Moscow appeared to be planning a “provocation” at the plant, and Energoatom also raised concerns about unusual activity. On Friday while the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, visited the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Russia reportedly closed the Zaporizhzhia site to most personnel, apart from those operating the power units, Energoatom said. Energoatom also accused Russia of shelling parts of the plant complex in false flag attacks that Moscow blamed on Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s western allies have warned that any nuclear incident would provoke a swift response. The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the House of Commons defence select committee, said on Friday that any nuclear accident at the site risked drawing Nato into the war. “Let’s make it clear now: ANY deliberate damage causing potential radiation leak to a Ukrainian nuclear reactor would be a breach of Nato’s Article 5,” he said on Twitter. Even if the reactors remain intact, however, Russia may plan to weaponise the plant simply by disconnecting it. With winter approaching, and Ukraine already concerned about gas supplies, the plant going offline could be damaging to the economy and people’s ability to stay warm. The power it provides would need to be generated at other plants, using up limited supplies of natural gas and other fuels, or the country could face blackouts. And excess heat from the plant is key to regional heating systems. The governor of Zaporizhzhia oblast, Oleksandr Starukh, has said that if the plant were to be disconnected, it would leave many of the city’s 700,000 residents without warmth in Ukraine’s bitter winter. “The heating system of the city is supplied by the nuclear power plant. So if they turn it off, there’s no way to heat [our buildings]”, he told the Guardian in June. “It’s just a huge problem.” Making a major change to operations of a nuclear plant in wartime is dangerous in itself, a senior Ukrainian energy official said. “The problem with Russia is that they’re so reckless,” said Yuriy Vitrenko, the chairman of the gas company Naftogaz, who described Russian actions as “insane”. “The nuclear regulator would usually need require you to test something to prove that it’s absolutely safe … it’s not like you cannot experiment with a nuclear power plant. And what they’re doing now is really against all the norms.” He said Russia did not fully understand the plant, which is from the Soviet era but has been extensively modernised. That meant the Russian regulator and Russian engineers were not fully up to date on how it works, he said. “They can come and see but again, it’s not their plant, so they don’t know everything they need to know about how it operates and what can and should be done with this plant,” he said.

Analysts expect Centrica, which owns Britain’s largest energy supplier, to post underlying profits of £3.3bn in 2022 on Thursday, up from £948m in 2021. The earnings, aided by surging profits in its North Sea oil and gas division, are expected to surpass the company’s previous profit high of £2.7bn, recorded in 2012. In the decade since, Centrica’s share price has tumbled as hundreds of thousands of British Gas customers have fled to rivals, including a string of new players that subsequently went bust during the energy crisis. British Gas has taken on some of those customers through the supplier of last resort process. Centrica is likely to face criticism for reporting huge profits on the back of a surge in wholesale gas prices linked to the war in Ukraine, which has pushed up prices for consumers. The company has also been in the spotlight over its treatment of vulnerable customers after it emerged that debt agents working for British Gas ignored vulnerabilities to break into customers’ homes to fit prepayment meters to recover debts. The company suspended the use of court warrants to install prepayment meters, and the government and energy regulator Ofgem later ordered all energy suppliers to pause the tactic. City analysts at Bernstein said the environment in the squeezed commodities market was “supportive” of higher profits at Centrica, “albeit tempered by the windfall taxes on nuclear as well as oil and gas”. Centrica has a 20% stake in Britain’s nuclear power stations, which are run by EDF and are subject to the electricity generator levy implemented by the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, to capture windfall gains. Bernstein expects Centrica’s profits to reduce to about £2bn in 2023, still far above levels before the energy crisis. Investors will be keen to learn Centrica’s forecasts for the price of wholesale gas, which has fallen sharply in recent weeks to below levels seen before the outbreak of war in Ukraine – although it is still above historic averages. It is hoped these falls will feed through into consumer bills over the coming months. The energy consultancy Cornwall Insight said on Wednesday it had seen indications that suppliers may be “able to offer competitively priced tariffs within a matter of weeks”. The government’s energy price guarantee policy has discouraged consumers from switching energy supplier during the winter as they receive about the same price regardless of supplier. But the consultancy predicts that millions of households could switch their energy supplier in second half of 2023, when bills are expected to ease. Household switching rates dropped from an average of 496,000 electricity supply points moving each month in 2019 to 85,000 a month in 2022."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/28/pressure-on-west-to-act-grows-after-report-on-iranian-uranium-enrichment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-28T19:59:17Z","webTitle":"Pressure on west to act grows after report on Iranian uranium enrichment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/28/pressure-on-west-to-act-grows-after-report-on-iranian-uranium-enrichment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/28/pressure-on-west-to-act-grows-after-report-on-iranian-uranium-enrichment","fields":{"headline":"Pressure on west to act grows after report on Iranian uranium enrichment","bodyText":"Iran has enriched uranium particles up to just short of weapons grade, placing further pressure on western powers to issue a third censure of Iran at a meeting of the nuclear watchdog board next week. In its quarterly report to the governing board of the International Atomic Energy Association, officials also revealed that the restrictions placed on its inspectors meant it would take a considerable time to provide a full inventory or history of Iran’s enrichment process. Iran has said the uranium particles, enriched to up to 83.7% purity, had occurred during the “transition period at the time of commissioning the process of [60%] product (November 2022) or while replacing the feed cylinder”. But the IAEA’s faith in Iran’s reassurances in the absence of corroborative evidence is at an all-time low, and will only encourage Israel to encourage the west to endorse a military assault on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Speaking in Berlin, Israel’s visiting foreign minister, Eli Cohen, claimed there were only two options to deal with Iran: using a so-called “snapback” mechanism to reinstate wider UN sanctions on Iran; and “to have a credible military option on the table as well”. But at the weekend, Bill Burns, the CIA director, continued to insist US intelligence did not have evidence that Iran had taken a weaponisation decision. The latest IAEA report to the board speaks about “particles”, suggesting it does not believe that Iran as a matter of policy is yet building a stockpile of uranium enriched above 60% – the level it has been enriching at from some time. The report finds the stockpile of uranium enriched at 60%, for which there is no known civilian nuclear use, has risen since the last report to the board. It estimated Iran’s total enriched uranium stockpile was 3,760.8kg (8,291lbs) as of 12 February. The limit set in the 2015 nuclear deal was set at 202.8kg of uranium, but that limit has been breached for many years by Iran. On Monday in Geneva, Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, insisted Tehran was willing to revive the nuclear deal, but the country’s leadership is riven about the wisdom of doing so. The US has said the revival of the talks is not its current focus. The west is under intense pressure to break off the talks, and instead to proscribe the Revolutionary Guardsin response to the suppression of Iranian street protests. In practice, the west has said it will not revive the deal until Iran explains to the IAEA’s satisfaction about the origins of nuclear particles found at three old but undeclared sites. Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general, is unlikely to go to Tehran unless he knows he is going to be given a fuller explanation than on his previous visits. Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal limited Tehran’s uranium enrichment to 3.67% – enough to fuel a nuclear power plant. The US unilateral withdrawal from the accord under Donald Trump’s presidency in 2018 set in motion a series of attacks and escalations by Tehran over its program."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/18/west-prepares-for-putin-to-use-whatever-tools-hes-got-left-in-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-18T05:00:37Z","webTitle":"West prepares for Putin to use ‘whatever tools he’s got left’ in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/18/west-prepares-for-putin-to-use-whatever-tools-hes-got-left-in-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/18/west-prepares-for-putin-to-use-whatever-tools-hes-got-left-in-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"West prepares for Putin to use ‘whatever tools he’s got left’ in Ukraine","bodyText":"Western leaders are preparing for Vladimir Putin to use “whatever tools he’s got left” including nuclear threats and cyber-attacks in response to an expected Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russia. British officials at the G7 foreign ministers’ summit in Japan said they were expecting Russia to retaliate and “must be prepared” for extreme tactics as it attempted to hold on to Ukrainian territory. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said last month that Moscow was ready for the Ukrainians to hit back, warning that his country would use “absolutely any weapon” if Kyiv attempted to retake Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. There appeared to be an acknowledgment in Moscow that its forces might soon find themselves on the defensive in Ukraine as Russia’s own winter offensive appeared to be slowing down. Russia’s nuclear rhetoric has united the G7 ministers, who issued a statement after their two-hour meeting on Monday condemning the threats as “unacceptable” and criticising Putin’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. G7 officials said there was an “open exchange of views” in the talks on the approach to the Ukrainian conflict, including on “future prospects” for bringing the war to an end, which Rishi Sunak has said would eventually be around the negotiating table. However, Foreign Office sources suggested that the only way to finally resolve the conflict would be for Putin to withdraw his troops from Crimea and for the west to give Kyiv the tools to finish the job. Despite pressure from Ukraine, and others including the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson, to increase military support – including more tanks and fighter jets – the UK believes it is providing what the country needs. Sources said it was already committing its “rainy day fund”. A transatlantic group of former senior diplomats and high-level military advisers said on Monday that the war in Ukraine was on course to become a stalemate unless the west went “all in” and increased its level of military support. The group said that “declarations of unwavering support” were not enough and “actions still fail to match the rhetoric” in a reflection of military assessments in European capitals and Washington. At the G7 summit, the ministers reaffirmed their commitment to “intensifying, fully coordinating and enforcing” sanctions against Russia, agreeing to be more coordinated to prevent evasion of the measures and to target third parties supplying weapons to Moscow. It came as the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, demanded the release of a British-Russian opposition leader after he was sentenced to 25 years in prison by a court in Moscow, paying tribute to Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr for “bravely” denouncing Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin critic, who has twice survived poisonings, was convicted on charges of treason and denigrating the Russian military in what he denounced as a show trial. The Russian ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, was summoned to the Foreign Office for a dressing down on Monday over Russia’s human rights obligations, including the right to a fair trial. Meanwhile, the US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s G7 bilateral talks with his French counterpart, Catherine Colonna, over-ran, prompting speculation her talks with the US had been fraught. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, provoked controversy last week when he said, on a flight back from China, that Europe should not become a “vassal” to the US on foreign policy. He had previously been accused of naivety when he said Moscow must not be “humiliated” and would need security guarantees. G7 officials stressed that all member nations, including France, were united on the need to prevent Putin’s attempts to divide and conquer. Eastern European governments, in particular, had accused Macron of failing to learn the lessons of the war. Without US military and financial support for Kyiv, more than 30 times that of France, Ukrainian resistance would have already crumbled, they believe. In separate talks in Japan, G7 nations including UK, US, Canada, Japan and France formed an alliance to develop shared supply chains for nuclear fuel, aimed at pushing Russia out of the international nuclear energy market. The UK’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the five countries would use their civil nuclear power sectors to undermine Russia’s grip on supply chains, cutting off another means for Putin to fund his invasion of Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/apr/20/down-to-earth-ipcc-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-20T15:23:58Z","webTitle":"Down to Earth: The path to radically lower emissions tucked away inside the devastating IPCC report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/20/down-to-earth-ipcc-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/apr/20/down-to-earth-ipcc-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Down to Earth: The path to radically lower emissions tucked away inside the devastating IPCC report","bodyText":"This piece first appeared in Down to Earth, the Guardian’s climate and environment newsletter. Sign up here to read more exclusive pieces like this and for a digest of the week’s biggest environment stories every Thursday It feels impossible. The world has to slash carbon emissions by almost half in the next seven years to remain on track for just 1.5C of global heating and avoid the worst of climate impacts. Yet emissions are rising. However, tucked away in the recent (and devastating) landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a chart that provides the road map for an escape from catastrophe. It assesses with extraordinary clarity the potential for emissions cuts of more than 40 options. You can view it here. The simplicity of the chart is deceptive. It was compiled by a team of the world’s best scientists, based on 175 studies. Its power is amplified by the fact that it was signed off by all of the world’s governments, from the cleanest and greenest to the darkest petrostates. So what does it show? First, solar and wind power are by far the best option, with the potential to cut a staggering 8bn tonnes from annual CO2 emissions by 2030. That is equivalent to the combined emissions of the US and European Union today. Even more startling is that most of that potential can be achieved at lower cost than just continuing with today’s electricity systems. “What struck me especially was that wind and solar was so big,” Prof Kornelis Blok, at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, told me this week. Blok, who led the work on the chart, identified the winners: “The big five are wind, solar, energy efficiency, stopping deforestation and reducing methane emissions.” Just as important as the winners in this analysis are the losers. Nuclear power and carbon capture and storage (CCS) each have just 10% of the potential of wind and solar, and at far higher cost. The same applies to bioenergy – burning wood or crops for electricity. It’s no wonder that the UK’s energy strategy, published last week, received significant criticism: it goes heavy on nuclear and CCS, while ignoring onshore wind. After wind and solar, the biggest prize is stopping the destruction of forests and other wild places, the IPCC scientists found. That has the potential to cut 4bn tonnes of emissions a year by 2030, not far off double the fossil fuel emissions from the whole of Africa and South America today. Including the restoration of degraded forests adds almost 3bn tonnes. Much of this could be achieved for less than $50 per tonne – half the price polluters pay for carbon permits in Europe today. Energy efficiency in buildings, industry, lighting and appliances remains a no-brainer – 4.5bn tonnes a year by 2030 – as does slashing methane emissions, particularly from leaky fossil fuel installations. The latter could save the equivalent of about 3bn tonnes. There are some interesting details too. A shift to “sustainable diets” – ie eating much less red meat in rich nations – could cut 1.7bn tonnes of emissions, equivalent to all the annual pollution from fossil fuel giant Russia. A push towards public transport, bikes and e-bikes has the potential to cut emissions more than the rollout of electric cars, showing both are needed. An often overlooked option – burying charcoal in fields (biochar) – is relatively costly to implement but potentially huge. Along with avoiding the ploughing of fields, which releases carbon, biochar could save 3.4bn tonnes of CO2 a year. The IPCC chart is a map of climate optimism. It shows we can cut emissions by half by 2030 with options costing at most $100 per tonne, which is a bargain when set against the further damages that climate inaction will inevitably bring. The solutions – wind, solar, trees, energy saving and methane cuts – require no new technology. But what they do require is a resource heavily lacking so far: the political will to push aside vested interests and rapidly pursue the policies that will work. “The chart is a very useful hitlist,” says Blok. “I think every country can take it and see in which areas they could do more. If we don’t achieve [a 50% cut in emissions by 2030], it will not be because of a lack of options.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/06/great-britains-windfarm-electricity-at-record-high-in-2022-but-gas-use-up-too","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-06T14:20:28Z","webTitle":"Great Britain’s windfarm electricity at record in 2022 but gas up too ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/06/great-britains-windfarm-electricity-at-record-high-in-2022-but-gas-use-up-too","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/06/great-britains-windfarm-electricity-at-record-high-in-2022-but-gas-use-up-too","fields":{"headline":"Great Britain’s windfarm electricity at record high in 2022 but gas use up too ","bodyText":"Windfarms produced a record amount of Great Britain’s electricity last year, although gas-fired generation also increased, National Grid has said. Figures from the company’s electricity system operator (ESO) showed that wind-powered electricity accounted for 26.8% of generation in 2022, up from 21.9% the year before. In late January last year, wind-powered electricity gained its highest ever share of the energy mix, accounting for 64% of generation. Earlier this week, the ESO said that a new record for wind generation was set on 30 December, when 20.91 gigawatts (GW) were produced by turbines. Renewable energy and nuclear power sources combined to generate 48.5% of Great Britain’s electricity, compared with 40% from gas and coal fossil fuels. The ESO said it was the second greenest year on record, behind only 2020. However, gas-fired power stations, at 38.5%, reached a three-year high as the single largest source of generation during a year in which wholesale gas prices soared as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine upended international commodity markets. During the Ukraine conflict, countries including the UK have delayed the closure of coal-fired power plants but also created new urgency in developing more renewable energy projects. The ESO said: “The use of coal in our day-to-day energy mix has continued to decline, with coal responsible for only 1.5% of generation in 2022, illustrating the significant reduction that has taken place over the last 10 years, when coal represented 43% of electricity produced in 2012.” Biomass accounted for 5.2% of generation. Demand for power was lowest during the year in the early hours of 12 June, at 15 gigawatts, while the highest demand was recorded on 15 December at 5pm, at 46 gigawatts. That came during a cold snap that put a strain on Britain’s energy systems. National Grid has embarked on the process of reworking electricity networks to better suit renewable power and connect up battery storage sites capable of storing electricity generated by wind and solar farms when the wind isn’t blowing or sun shining. Ministers were forced to scramble last year to ensure back-up power plans were in place for winter in case cold weather or a sudden halt to Russian gas supplies caused power cuts. However, those concerns are fading as recent mild weather and a subsequent fall in wholesale gas prices reflect an improving energy outlook this winter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/27/nationals-push-for-10m-fines-and-ability-to-break-up-coles-and-woolworths-if-they-abuse-market-power","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-26T15:00:40Z","webTitle":"Nationals push for $10m fines and ability to break up Coles and Woolworths if they abuse market power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/27/nationals-push-for-10m-fines-and-ability-to-break-up-coles-and-woolworths-if-they-abuse-market-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/27/nationals-push-for-10m-fines-and-ability-to-break-up-coles-and-woolworths-if-they-abuse-market-power","fields":{"headline":"Nationals push for $10m fines and ability to break up Coles and Woolworths if they abuse market power","bodyText":"David Littleproud has offered to help Labor bolster competition law protections for farmers and suppliers in a bid to prevent potential abuses of market power by Australia’s big supermarkets.

The current penalty on breaching the grocery code, which is voluntary for our big supermarkets, is about $64,000 … That’s a cost of doing business. “Let’s have punitive penalties there, $10m plus divesture powers. I think if Woolies or Coles would lose … [alcohol retail business] Dan Murphy’s because they did the wrong thing by a farmer or by a small supplier, that they’d make sure they’re playing within the guidelines of fair and equitable trade. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoonemail newsletters for your daily news roundup “Because this is the problem: they have 74% of the retail market. That is a market imbalance and even the [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission] say that. On Friday, Coles’ supermarkets announced total group sales in the third quarter grew 6.5 per cent to $9.7 billion, with supermarket sales up 7.0 per cent to $8.6b and liquor sales rising 2.6 per cent to $801m. Outgoing CEO Steven Cain attributed the success to Coles’ home brand range, Flybuys points program and weekly special deals. Littleproud said the Nationals would like to work with the government to protect small business. “So I think there’s some reforms there that the Nationals would like to work with the government, to say let’s shift the dial on this, let’s protect small business against big supermarkets. “And it’s only regulatory. So if they’re doing the right thing, Coles, Woolies and Aldi shouldn’t care one iota. “The small supplier and particularly farmers are getting done over and this is where they just need protection. They’re not asking for charity, they’re just asking for a fair price that’s transparent to their cost of production and what it is to get on on to … their shelves and on to your plate.” On Friday the former competition watchdog head Rod Sims told Guardian Australia the big supermarkets have likely used their market power to increase prices higher than necessary during a cost-of-living crisis and that the government should consider reforming merger laws to limit their dominance. Leigh said he “[welcomed] bipartisanship in this important area of competition policy” after a decade in which the Coalition presided over “the worst productivity growth in the postwar era”. “As I’ve highlighted in a series of recent speeches, Australia’s economy has become increasingly dominated by a handful of big players,” he said. “Since coming to office, Labor has increased penalties for anti-competitive conduct and banned unfair contract terms. “We’re consulting on banning unfair trading practices and tackling anti-competitive behaviour in specific sectors. We’re also in the process of reviewing the effectiveness of the dispute resolution mechanisms under the grocery code of conduct.” In a wide-ranging interview, Littleproud said at the 2022 election the Nationals had “lost a lot of voters, and particularly in the cohort of 18- to 54-year-old women and young people”. Littleproud suggested the Nationals could re-engage with these voters by advocating for childcare accessibility, regional health, and committing that “we are serious about net zero and about how we achieve it”. Littleproud echoed opposition leader Peter Dutton’s call for an investigation of small-scale modular nuclear power to help firm electricity from renewables, which the Albanese government has ruled out on cost and feasibility grounds. Littleproud defended the Nationals’ decision to come out in November in opposition to the Indigenous voice to parliament in the constitution. In contrast to Dutton’s claims that the voice proposal lacked detail, Littleproud said “the detail has been there for some time about the principle that the prime minister would be putting to the Australian people”. Littleproud argued that Australia doesn’t “need a bigger bureaucracy, you just need a better one” to help narrow the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in health and social outcomes. “The thing that I’m most disappointed in all this is that there is no ambitious goal to say, as a nation, that we will have closed the gap by 2030, 2035.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/dec/12/citizen-nobel-review-chemistry-prize-winner-becomes-charismatic-climate-crusader","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-12T07:00:56Z","webTitle":"Citizen Nobel review – chemistry prize winner becomes charismatic climate crusader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/12/citizen-nobel-review-chemistry-prize-winner-becomes-charismatic-climate-crusader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/dec/12/citizen-nobel-review-chemistry-prize-winner-becomes-charismatic-climate-crusader","fields":{"headline":"Citizen Nobel review – chemistry prize winner becomes charismatic climate crusader","bodyText":"Here is an invigorating portrait of one of Europe’s most distinguished scientists, caught at the very point of morphing into a public intellectual and vehement campaigner. In 2017, Swiss biophysicist Jacques Dubochet won the Nobel prize in chemistry – jointly with Richard Henderson of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge and Joachim Frank of Columbia in New York – for his work on cryo-electron microscopy, freezing biomolecules in mid-movement and so rendering them visible for the first time; this was a great leap forward for pharmacy and medicine. The snowy-haired Dubochet, who did his important work at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg before returning to Lausanne, is shown to be at first bemused and a little flustered by the hordes of excitable photographers who descend on his tranquil campus, clamouring for interviews and demanding a soundbite explanation of his work for the TV news. But Dubochet is no innocent: he was a committed anti-nuclear campaigner in Germany in the “Atomkraft? Nein Danke” era of the 80s, and the film shows it dawning on Dubochet that he can use his new platform to campaign on the new issue that he’s passionate about – the climate crisis. Dubochet thus becomes a participant in climate-strike demos, beaming at young people’s idealism, appearing alongside Greta Thunberg, and becoming enraged at his fellow Swiss for their complacent insularity and at journalists for their supposed neutrality, and failure to report the crisis. He also – just maybe – becomes a little bit intoxicated by his own celebrity, a possibility hinted at during a discussion over the family dinner table. This is a thoroughly worthwhile documentary, although there is one subject I’d like to hear Dubochet address: as an anti-nuke veteran, does he have any time for environmentalists who believe that nuclear power might not be as evil as all that? • Citizen Nobel is released on 16 December on True Story."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/04/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-193-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-04T15:25:31Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 193 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/04/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-193-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/04/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-193-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 193 of the invasion","bodyText":"President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has pushed the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to prepare a fresh package of sanctions, including a ban on issuing visas to Russian citizens. Russian forces have hit multiple residential targets in Mykolaiv overnight, according to its governor, Vitaliy Kim. He said homes were damaged, as well as three hospitals, two education facilities, a hotel and a museum. A video showing Russian multiple-launch rocket systems firing from the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been published by the Insider. The footage, taken overnight on Friday into early Saturday morning, shows the missile launchers close to a power unit. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, visited Germany on Sunday – the first high-level Ukrainian official to visit the country in months. The trip is a sign of eased tensions after a rocky patch between Kyiv and Berlin. Zelenskiy said Russia was using “poverty and political chaos” to attack the lives of all Europeans. In his evening address late on Saturday, the presidentsaid that by stopping the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, Russia wanted to “destroy the normal life of every European”. Russian forces are suffering from “morale and discipline issues” in addition to combat fatigue and high casualties, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. Troops’ main grievances probably continued to be around pay, including the high chance that “sizeable combat bonuses” were not being paid, the latest British intelligence update said. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and is relying on a reserve line, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Previously, there had been reports the plant in south-eastern Ukraine had been knocked offline in the early hours of Saturday amid sustained shelling that destroyed a key power line, according to local Russian-backed authorities. Sweden has said it would provide liquidity guarantees to Nordic and Baltic energy companies worth “billions of dollars” in an effort to prevent a financial crisis sparked by Europe’s energy crunch. The Russian energy company Gazprom has said Siemens Energy is ready to help repair broken equipment for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, but claimed there was nowhere available for it to carry out the work. The European Union expects Russia to respect existing energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if it fails to do so, the economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told Vladimir Putin that his country can play a facilitator role regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, according to his office."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/mar/01/uk-energy-firms-must-pass-on-price-savings-to-customers-grant-shapps","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-01T05:00:23Z","webTitle":"UK energy firms must pass on price savings to customers, ministers warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/01/uk-energy-firms-must-pass-on-price-savings-to-customers-grant-shapps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/mar/01/uk-energy-firms-must-pass-on-price-savings-to-customers-grant-shapps","fields":{"headline":"UK energy firms must pass on price savings to customers, ministers warn","bodyText":"Ministers have warned energy firms that they must pass on the benefits of lower wholesale prices to consumers, amid concern that bills could rise this spring. In a speech on Wednesday, Grant Shapps will tell energy suppliers that reduced wholesale prices must be seen in consumer prices, “no ifs, buts or maybes”. In an apparent sign of government concern about the impact of reduced direct support for domestic energy bills, the energy secretary will spell out his message in a speech at the Chatham House thinktank in London. “I have one overriding mission in this new job: for the UK to have amongst the cheapest wholesale electricity prices in Europe,” said Shapps, whose formal brief changed from being business and energy secretary to energy security and net – zero secretary amid a mini-reshuffle and restructuring earlier in February. “This is critical to consumers, to our country and to our planet,” he added. “Making the most of our position as a world-leaders in renewables and nuclear technology, homegrown sources that will shield households from the worst excesses of the volatile global fossil-fuel markets. And suppliers must be ready to pass those savings on to consumers.” Ministers face pressure to postpone the reduction in support for consumer energy bills due in April, given the impact on cost of living pressures. On Monday, the energy regulator, Ofgem, said its energy cap – the amount suppliers can charge for average dual fuel, direct debit customers – would fall by 23% for the three months from 1 April to £3,280, from £4,279 for the January to March quarter. However, the reduction in government help means that the actual price paid by an average household will rise from £2,100 a year in April to £3,000. Wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply in recent months but the drop is yet to feed through into household bills because suppliers buy their energy months in advance. Shapps’ speech, extracts of which were released in advance by his department, will also focus on wider energy security issues, with a pledge that “never again should [Vladimir] Putin or anyone like him even think they can hold the UK to ransom”. The government has promised to invest heavily in domestic-based energy sources, including nuclear power, renewables and some continued fossil fuel extraction. The latter has prompted protest groups to vow to obstruct this, with Shapps due to also promise action to tackle them. “Families have seen the impact on the pounds in their pockets of Putin’s illegal march on Ukraine a year ago – and it has opened the world’s eyes to just how vulnerable we are to tyrants like him,” he will say. “Working towards this overarching goal of cheaper wholesale electricity will mean we will be powering Britain from Britain, increasing our energy security and independence – the kind of independence that comes from having the four biggest windfarms off our shores. “And all this will be better for our planet – energy security and tackling climate change are ultimately two sides of the same coin. And it will be this – not the eco-extremists like Extinction Rebellion causing disruption and dismay – that will have people voting with their feet as they see the benefits of achieving net zero.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-five-injured-in-kyiv-drone-strikes-as-air-raid-sirens-sound-across-ukraine","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-08T15:12:42Z","webTitle":"Moscow launches new strikes across Ukraine; Kyiv claims Russia has lost 100,000 soldiers in Bakhmut – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-five-injured-in-kyiv-drone-strikes-as-air-raid-sirens-sound-across-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-five-injured-in-kyiv-drone-strikes-as-air-raid-sirens-sound-across-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Moscow launches new strikes across Ukraine; Kyiv claims Russia has lost 100,000 soldiers in Bakhmut – as it happened","bodyText":"A Russian missile attack overnight destroyed a Red Cross warehouse containing aid in Odesa. The Odesa regional organisation of the Red Cross society said workers and volunteers were not in the 1,000 sq metre unit at the time. “The provision of humanitarian aid and the activities of some projects of the Odesa Regional Organisation of the Red Cross of Ukraine have been suspended,” the statement adds. At least five people were wounded by Russian strikes on Kyiv, city officials said, as Moscow launched another large-scale attack on Ukraine. Three people were injured in blasts in Kyiv’s Solomyanskyi district and two others were injured when drone wreckage fell on to the Sviatoshyn district, both west of the capital’s centre, mayor Vitali Klitschko said on his Telegram messaging channel. Russian artillery shelling wounded eight people, including a nine-year-old boy, in two villages in Kherson, regional officials said. Six civilians were wounded in the village of Stanislav on the right bank of the Dnipro estuary, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said, Reuters reports. About 100,000 Russian soldiers have died in the battle to capture Bakhmut, a Ukrainian general has claimed. Col Serhiy Cherevaty, who is spokesperson for the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said that they were “rough calculations” in an interview on Ukrainian TV. He said: “I am sure that further verification will only show an increase in this number. This is natural as the enemy uses the so-called meat assaults as the main method of waging war.” Ukraine’s largest steel producer, ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, said that it had told staff to take Tuesday off or work remotely because of the threat of Russian air strikes. The company, which employs about 20,000 people is located in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s hometown, often the target of Russian drone and missile attacks, Reuters reported. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group appears to have ditched plans to withdraw from Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, saying they had been promised more arms by Moscow. Ukraine’s general in charge of the defence of the besieged city said late on Sunday that Russia had intensified shelling and hoped to take Bakhmut by Tuesday, which is Victory Day in Russia, the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi vowed to do everything he could to prevent it. Russian investigators have charged a man with terrorism offences after a car bombing wounded a prominent Russian nationalist writer. The explosion in Nizhny Novgorod, western Russia on Saturday, broke both legs of Zakhar Prilepin, an ardent supporter of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. His close associate, who was in the car with him, was killed. Alexander Permyakov was charged with committing a “terrorist act” and illegal handling of explosives, the prosecutor general’s office said in a statement, according to Reuters. Prilepin has written a description of the car bombing that killed his assistant and left him badly injured on Telegram, in his first comments since the attack on Saturday. Operations at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are being suspended in case of “provocations” by Ukrainian forces, the TASS state news agency reported.Ukraine is expected to initiate a counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory, including potentially in the Zaporizhzhia region and Russian authorities have begun evacuating people. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv on Tuesday, the European Commission announced. The EU could impose penalties on countries helping Moscow dodge western sanctions as part of a drive to close loopholes in the regime of restrictions on the Russian economy. A draft EU regulation seen by the Guardian proposes that non-EU countries could be included in future sanctions if shown to be at “particularly high risk of being used for circumvention against Russia”. A total of 1,679 people, including 660 children, have been evacuated from areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, a Moscow-installed official in the Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporizhzhia region has said. The head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has warned that the situation around the plant has become “potentially dangerous” with Ukraine expected to start a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory soon, including in the Zaporizhzhia region. President Zelenskiy marked the anniversary of the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945 by saying he would formalise a day of remembrance in Ukraine on 8 May when other western countries celebrate Europe’s victory. Russia’s population has declined by 2 million more than expected over the last three years, according to UK intelligence. NATO air policing units were put on a higher state of readiness following a near-miss between a Russian fighter jet and a Polish aircraft on patrol for the EU’s border agency Frontex on Friday, a NATO official said. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the official told Reuters: “NATO air policing detachments were put on higher readiness in response to the dangerous behaviour of a Russian military plane in the vicinity of a Polish Frontex aircraft over the Black Sea near Romania.” The official said NATO “remains vigilant” and referred further questions to the Polish authorities. Operations at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are being suspended in case of “provocations” by Ukrainian forces, the TASS state news agency reported. Ukraine is expected to initiate a counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory, including potentially in the Zaporizhzhia region and Russian authorities have begun evacuating people. TASS quoted Yevgeny Balitsky, the Moscow-installed governor, as saying: “We’ve seen the level (of water in the nearby Kakhovka Reservoir) rise to 17.8 metres. “We realise that this is manipulation. The nuclear reactors have been suspended.” Ukraine’s largest steel producer, ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, said that it had told staff to take Tuesday off or work remotely because of the threat of Russian air strikes. The company, which employs about 20,000 people is located in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s hometown, often the target of Russian drone and missile attacks, Reuters reported. A spokesperson said the measure reflected “the escalation of enemy attacks throughout the country and the downing of a reconnaissance drone in Kryvyi Rih, on Saturday. Moscow has intensified air strikes this month as Ukraine prepares to launch a counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. It has also vowed to retaliate after blaming Kyiv for an apparent drone attack on Moscow’s Kremlin citadel, for which Ukraine denied responsibility. In Odesa, flames engulfed what the Ukrainian Red Cross said was a 1,000 sq m food warehouse that it was operating. It said all the humanitarian aid stored there had been destroyed, Reuters reports. After air raid alerts blared for hours over roughly two-thirds of Ukraine, local media said explosions sounded in the southern region of Kherson and southeastern Zaporizhzhia. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in Zaporizhzhia, said Russian forces hit a warehouse and Ukrainian troops’ position in the small city of Orikhiv. The Russian-appointed governor, Yevgeny Balitsky, said around 3,000 civilians had been evacuated from areas near the front line that had come under shelling in Zaporizhzhia, one of the areas where Ukraine could launch its counteroffensive. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has shared a photo of a missile attack in Odesa. The time is approaching 6pm in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Here’s a roundup of today’s news as Russian forces destroyed a Red Cross warehouse in Odesa as part of a wave of strikes that hit several parts of Ukraine.

Military call-ups are making the most important times of the arable calendar – the sowing and harvesting seasons – even tougher in Ukraine, Reuters reports. The agency has spoken to Kees Huizinga, a Dutch farmer in the Cherkasy region of central Ukraine, who has seen about 40 of his 350 workers sign up to fight in the war, with their replacements lacking experience. Reuters says Huizinga fears this could mean a fall in grain and milk yields – and, with them, a drop in his income. Three other farmers, a major farm operator and an agrarian association told the agency the military call-ups were affecting them too. They said assessing the impact of staff shortages on output is all but impossible – but just another complication in an already difficult campaign. Ukraine’s grain output – for a long time a driver of its export revenues and of global grain markets – is already down sharply because of a war that has disrupted exports, reduced access to fertilisers and made huge swathes of farmland inaccessible. Steps by Kyiv to ringfence the key agriculture sector from the military draft have had only a limited impact, Reuters reports. Most of the farming sources the agency spoke to said they could get by with replacement workers and employees doubling up on some jobs, but that nothing replaces experience. Huizinga said: You lose some efficiency there. You lose the quality. The 48-year-old, who comes from near the Dutch city of Groningen and moved to Ukraine drawn by its cheaper land prices, said the losses could run to a few hundred thousand dollars or more for his farm. On his 15,000 hectares of land, he has milking cattle, plus young stock, and grows a variety of vegetable and grain crops, having withstood unpredictable weather and price fluctuations among other challenges over the years. Kyiv’s mayor says Russia fired 60 Iranian-made kamikaze drones at Ukrainian targets, including 36 at the capital, all of which were shot down. However, he said debris hit flats and other buildings, injuring at least five people on the ground. Russian artillery shelling wounded eight people, including a nine-year-old boy, in two villages in Ukraine’s southern region of Kherson on Monday, regional officials said. Six civilians were wounded in the village of Stanislav on the right bank of the Dnipro estuary, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said, Reuters reports. Two others were hurt in Antonivka, on Kherson’s outskirts, said military administration chief Roman Mrochko. The two people in Antonivka had been near one of the many “invincibility points” that Ukraine set up nationwide to provide access to electricity, heating, water and other basic services for civilians facing outages caused by Russian airstrikes. Ukrainian troops recaptured the city of Kherson last November after nearly eight months of occupation by Russian forces who seized it soon after launching their full-scale invasion. The area now comes under frequent artillery fire from Russian forces dug in on the opposite side of the Dnieper River. Russia has effectively stopped the Black Sea grain deal by refusing to register incoming vessels, Ukraine’s reconstruction ministry has said. “The Russian Federation once again effectively stopped the ‘grain initiative’ by refusing to register incoming vessels and carry out their inspections. This approach contradicts the terms of the current agreement,” the ministry said in a statement according to Reuters. About 100,000 Russian soldiers have died in the battle to capture Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, a Ukrainian general has claimed. Col Serhiy Cherevaty, who is spokesperson for the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said that they were “rough calculations” in an interview on Ukrainian TV. He said: “I am sure that further verification will only show an increase in this number. This is natural as the enemy uses the so-called meat assaults as the main method of waging war.” Cherevaty said that Russia had launched about 415 artillery strikes in the last 24 hours. He added that 64 Russian soldiers were killed on Sunday. Cherevaty also said that Russia did not seem to be low on ammunition, despite claims to the contrary by the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin. “Such statements by the Wagner group leader are most likely connected with the fact that he made too many promises about the capture of Bakhmut and invents this nonsense about ammo shortage since, apart from manpower losses, he has no other ‘victories.’” Russian investigators have charged a man with terrorist offences after a car bombing wounded a prominent Russian nationalist writer. The explosion on Saturday in Nizhny Novgorod, western Russia, broke both legs of Zakhar Prilepin, an ardent supporter of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. His close associate, who was in the car with him, was killed. Alexander Permyakov was charged with committing a “terrorist act” and illegal handling of explosives, the prosecutor general’s office said in a statement, according to Reuters. A court remanded him in custody for two months. Russia’s foreign ministry has accused Ukraine and the western states of backing it, particularly the US, for the attack. Ukraine’s security services neither confirmed nor denied involvement. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he believed Russian authorities staged the attack. The US state department has not commented on the incident. Russia’s state news agency TASS quoted security sources as saying the suspect was a “native of Ukraine” with a past conviction for robbery with violence. Prilepin was the third prominent pro-war figure to be targeted by a bomb since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia also blamed Ukraine for the deaths of journalist Darya Dugina and war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in the two previous attacks. Kyiv has denied involvement. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv on Tuesday, the European Commission announced on Monday. The visit on Europe Day reaffirms “the EU’s unwavering support towards the country”, a spokesperson for the European Commission told reporters. “The visit will focus on all the dimensions of our relations with Ukraine,” he added. The EU could impose penalties on countries helping Moscow dodge western sanctions as part of a drive to close loopholes in the regime of restrictions on the Russian economy. A draft EU regulation seen by the Guardian proposes that non-EU countries could be included in future sanctions if shown to be at “particularly high risk of being used for circumvention against Russia”. This would mean imposing restrictions on the sale of certain goods to that country if it was believed they were being re-exported to Russia. The plans, which will be subject to intense discussion from EU member states, could yet be watered down amid concern about pushing sanction-targeted countries into the arms of the Kremlin. Since the EU and western allies imposed heavy sanctions on the Russian economy after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the bloc’s exports to its eastern neighbour have fallen sharply. But EU trade with former Soviet countries in the Caucasus and central Asia has jumped, as have some of these countries’ onward exports to Russia – a process called “the Eurasian roundabout” by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has studied the issue. At the same time, Turkey and China have also increased their sales to Russia. EU diplomats are wary of antagonising these countries and pushing them closer to Russia, but there is also understanding that the continued flow of exports is blunting the impact of western sanctions. The issue is the centrepiece of the EU’s 11th round of sanctions against Russia, which otherwise contains few substantial measures. Some EU diplomats argue the EU has little left to sanction, with contentious issues – such as a ban on Russian diamonds and civil nuclear technology – too difficult to agree among the 27 member states. The EU also wants to impose personal sanctions – asset freezes and travel bans – on a further 72 people and 29 organisations deemed to be supporting the war effort. On the draft list are people putting out the Kremlin line on state TV, those responsible for the transportation of Ukrainian children to Russia and two commanders of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, who were recently found guilty in absentia by a Dutch court for the murder of 298 people on board Flight MH17 in 2014, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Russian forces are moving members of the local authority, collaborators, children and teachers from the city of Tokmak in Zaporizhzhia to the city of Berdiansk, which is also under Russian control. Parents have been told not to enrol the children into schools if they have refused the evacuation order, according to the General Staff of Ukraine’s daily update. Meanwhile, queues for petrol are in place, with drivers in Tokmak told that no new deliveries are planned. Volodymyr Zelenskiy marked the anniversary of the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945 by saying he would formalise a day of remembrance in Ukraine on 8 May when other western countries celebrate Europe’s victory. Speaking to the nation on a hill overlooking Kyiv, Zelenskiy compared Putin’s Russia to Hitler’s Germany, saying the Kremlin was pursuing “enslavement and destruction”, as the Nazis did, Reuters reports. He said Russia would not succeed. Further cementing Ukraine’s break with its Soviet past, Zelenskiy said he had submitted a bill to parliament officially making 8 May a day of remembrance and victory, while 9 May – when Russia marks Victory Day – would become Europe Day. “We are returning to our state an honest history without ideological influences. It is on 8 May that most nations of the world remember the greatness of the victory over the Nazis,” he said in a video posted on the president’s Telegram channel. “Today, I signed the relevant decree, and every year from tomorrow, 9 May, we will commemorate our historic unity – the unity of all Europeans who destroyed Nazism and will defeat Ruscism,” he said, using a word Ukrainians have coined to describe what they call Russian fascism. About eight Kh-22 cruise missiles were fired by Russia at Odesa overnight according to Ukraine’s air force spokesperson. Yurii Ihnat said that “some of them did not reach their targets”, the Kyiv Independent reported, as Ihnat spoke on television. He said that they were older Soviet missiles. Despite their apparent age, Russia used the same missile in an attack that hit a residential building in Dnipro on 14 January, killing 40 civilians and injuring over 70. Ukraine’s air force earlier reported that Russian forces had attacked Odesa using Tu-22 M3 long-range bombers from Cape Tarkhankut in Russian-occupied Crimea. The warehouse of a food company and a recreational area on the Black Sea coast were hit, according to Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Odesa military administration. No casualties were reported. Russian military recruiters have been targeting central Asian migrant workers in Russia to serve in Ukraine, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Recruiters have visited mosques and immigration offices to recruit. At immigration offices, staff who speak Tajik and Uzbek routinely attempt to recruit migrants. Radio Free Europe reported recruiters offering sign-up bonuses of USD $2,390 and salaries of up to USD $4,160 a month. Migrants have also been offered a fast-track Russian citizenship path of six months to one year, instead of the usual five years. The high monthly salary and sign-up bonuses will entice some migrant workers to sign up. These recruits are likely sent to the Ukrainian frontlines where the casualty rate is extremely high. Recruiting migrants is part of the Russian ministry of defence’s attempts to fulfil its target of 400,000 volunteers to fight in Ukraine. The authorities are almost certainly seeking to delay any new overt mandatory mobilisation for as long as possible to minimise domestic dissent. More photos have emerged of the damage done after Russia launched drone strikes on Kyiv overnight: Russia appears to have ramped up its attacks on Ukraine ahead of its annual Victory Day parade in Moscow on Tuesday, which marks the anniversary of Soviet Russia’s victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. The celebration has gradually emerged as the centrepiece of Vladimir Putin’s vision of Russian identity over his 23 years in charge. But this year there are signs of unease among the Russian leadership over the celebrations amid fears of Ukrainian strikes, the Guardian’s Pjotr Sauer reports from Moscow, after drones operated by unknown people attacked the Kremlin last week. “There is a nervousness that I have never seen before,” said one official at the Moscow mayor’s office. “But Victory Day has to go ahead, there is no other option.” Some images of the damage from last night’s strikes on Ukraine, in which five people were injured in Kyiv. A bit more from the ISW update I posted about earlier. The thinktank’s analysts argue that the latest spat between Wagner and the Russian ministry of defence shows that army Gen Valery Gerasimov, overall campaign commander in Ukraine, and possibly minister of defence Sergei Shoigu “lack the ability to command [Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin and [Chechen leader Ramzan] Kadyrov as subordinates but must instead negotiate with them as peers”. The ISW writes further: Gerasimov’s degraded abilities to control his commanders will likely further limit the Russian military’s ability to conduct coherent operations involving different areas of responsibility … ISW has previously assessed that factional dynamics within the Russian military are shaping decision-making to an unusual degree, and the increasing erosion of the Russian chain of command is likely caught in a self-reinforcing feedback loop with the Russian military’s growing factionalism. ISW assesses that Putin is unlikely to remove Gerasimov as overall theatre commander for reputational reasons, and therefore Prigozhin’s and Kadyrov’s public undermining of Gerasimov may have lasting impacts on the power of the overall theatre commander’s position. Prominent pro-Kremlin writer Zakhar Prilepin has written a description of the car bombing that killed his assistant and left him badly injured, in his first comments since the attack on Saturday. Writing on Telegram on Sunday, the Russian nationalist said he had been driving and that his assistant was in the passenger seat when the bomb blew up under his assistant’s wheel. Prilepin said he had dropped his daughter off just five minutes before the explosion. “I tell the demons: you will not intimidate anyone. God exists. We will win,” he added at the end of his post. Ukraine says it destroyed all 35 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Russia in a wave of attacks across the country early Monday. In its usual morning update the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said Russia had also launched 16 missile strikes on cities and regions including Kharkiv, Kherson, Nikolaev and Odessa as well as 61 airstrikes. It also reported 52 instances of enemy shelling and said “Unfortunately, there are killed and wounded among civilians, damaged high-rise building, private residences and other civilian infrastructures.” “The probability of further Russian missile and air strikes across Ukraine remains high,” it added. We’re going to pause the blog here for a couple of hours but will of course return to bring you any breaking news. Here are the latest developments: Five people have been injured in Kyiv after Russia launched a fresh wave of drone and missile strikes on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday. Two of those were wounded when drone wreckage fell on a two-storey building in the city’s west, while drone debris also fell on the runway at the city’s the Zhuliany airport. Explosions were also reported in the Black Sea city of Odesa, where Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Odesa military administration, said a food warehouse and a recreation area had been set on fire. Further Russian strikes were also reported in Zaporizhzhia and in the southern region of Kherson. Russian Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin appears to have ditched plans to withdraw from Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, saying he has been promised more arms by Moscow. Ukraine’s general in charge of the defence of the besieged city said late on Sunday that Russia had intensified shelling and hoped to take Bakhmut by Tuesday, Victory Day in Russia, the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi vowed to do everything he could to prevent it. Prigozhin and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov “likely effectively blackmailed” Russia’s Ministry of Defence into allocating Wagner more resources, the Institute for the Study of War said in its latest assessment of the conflict. Kadyrov was happy to help Prigozhin in order to reestablish his position within the circle of power in the Kremlin, it argued. A total of 1,679 people, including 660 children, have been evacuated from areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, a Moscow-installed official in the Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporizhzhia region has said. The head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has warned that the situation around the plant has become “potentially dangerous” with Ukraine expected to start a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory soon, including in the Zaporizhzhia region. Nine Ukrainian explosives experts who were engaged in de-mining were killed in a single Russian attack in the southern Kherson region on Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest evening address. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has threatened anyone convicted of carrying out Saturday’s attack on nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin with death in prison. Writing on Telegram, Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said that any suspects, “like other criminals, will be tried for the attack and sentenced to long prison terms”. Prilepin, who was injured in a car explosion on Saturday, has been brought out of a medically induced coma, according to local officials. Five people have been injured in a strike on the city of Balakliia, local authorities have said. Oleg Synegubov, the governor of eastern Kharkiv region, said on Telegram that a missile landed near a car park on Sunday. Sixteen settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were hit by a total of 75 strikes over the past day, according to the local military administration. A 72-year-old woman has been killed and two people were injured by shelling in the southern Dnipro region, local officials said. The number of Russian soldiers killed or injured since the start of the war stands at 193,430, according to the latest estimates from the Ukrainian military. Russia’s population has declined by 2 million more than expected over the last three years due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, according to UK intelligence. More from that ISW report I mentioned earlier: the analysis suggests that Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov was happy to help Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin “blackmail” the Russian defence ministry in order to reestablish his position within the circle of power in the Kremlin. The think tank writes: Kadyrov had previously held an influential position within … Putin’s close circle … until apparently losing favor recently, likely because his forces played a limited role in active combat operations in Ukraine throughout late fall of 2022 and winter of 2023. Putin belittled Kadyrov during their meeting on March 13 where Kadyrov appeared visibly nervous when reporting on the Chechen fighters’ role in Ukraine. Kadyrov likely saw Prigozhin’s threats to withdraw from Bakhmut as an opportunity to play up the effectiveness of his forces against the backdrop of Gerasimov’s and Shoigu’s failures to deliver decisive victories during the winter-spring offensive. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed local official in Zaporizhzhia, said that Russian forces overnight also hit a warehouse and Ukrainian troops’ position in Orikhiv, a small city in the region, Reuters reported. The news wire was not able to independently verify the report. Russia has launched a string of missile and drone attacks on Ukraine in recent weeks, killing dozens of people across the country. Targets have included civilian areas: eight people died in a supermarket in Kherson last week and 23 people, including a baby boy, were killed in the city of Uman when a Russian missile struck an apartment block at the end of April. Russian missiles were also aimed at Odesa, hitting a food warehouse and a “recreation area”, according to Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Odesa military administration. He wrote on Telegram: X-22 rockets were directed at the warehouse of one of the food enterprises and at the recreation area on the Black Sea coast. Rescuers are working to eliminate fires. There was no information about the victims. The information is being clarified. More detail on the strikes on Kyiv from Reuters, which reports: Three people were injured in blasts in Kyiv’s Solomyanskyi district and two others were injured when drone wreckage fell onto the Sviatoshyn district, both west of the capital’s centre, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on his Telegram messaging channel. The Kyiv’s military administration said that drone wreckage fell on a runway of the Zhuliany airport, one of the two passenger airports of the Ukrainian capital, causing no fire, but emergency services were working on the site. It also said that in Kyiv’s central Shevchenkivskyi district, drone debris seemed to have hit a two-storey building, causing damages. There was no immediate information about potential casualties. Reuters’ witnesses said they had heard numerous explosions in Kyiv, with local officials saying that air defence systems were repelling the attacks. It was not immediately clear how many drones were launched on Kyiv. The ISW analysis comes after Reuters reported that Wagner group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin had ditched his plans to withdraw from the eastern city of Bakhmut on Sunday after receiving promises that his fighters would receive as much ammunition as they needed. Prigozhin wrote on Telegram: Overnight we received a combat order, for the first time in all this time. We have been promised as much ammunition and weapons as we need to continue further operations. We have been promised that everything needed to prevent the enemy from cutting us off [from supplies] will be deployed on the flank. Prigozhin had announced on Friday that his fighters, who have spearheaded the months-long assault on Bakhmut, would pull out because he said his men had been starved of ammunition and taken “useless and unjustified” losses as a result. Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov “likely effectively blackmailed” Russia’s Ministry of Defence into allocating Wagner more resources, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest assessment of the conflict. The US-based think tank writes: Kadyrov published a letter on May 6 asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to order Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Director of the Russian National Guard (Rosgvadia) Viktor Zolotov to authorize the transfer of Chechen “Akhmat” units from “other directions” to assume Wagner’s positions in the Bakhmut direction. Kadyrov’s letter to Putin bypassed the Russian chain of command, and the withdrawal of Chechen forces from other parts of the theater likely posed a risk to Russian defensive lines, a risk that [Army General Valery] Gerasimov and Shoigu, or Putin, appear to have been unwilling to take. Kyiv’s local council has sounded the all-clear after Russia carried out strikes on the Ukrainian capital in the early hours of Monday. “Please keep an eye on reports and return to shelter if the siren sounds again,” the city’s administration wrote on Telegram. The strikes come as Russian forces begin evacuating people from the Russian-occupied area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, with more than 1,600 people, including 660 children, evacuated so far, Reuters reported, citing a Moscow-installed local official. Ukraine is soon expected to start a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory, including in the Zaporizhzhia region and on Saturday the head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog warned that the situation around the plant had become “potentially dangerous”. In its morning update on Sunday, Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces were evacuating local Russian passport-holders. “The first to be evacuated are those who accepted Russian citizenship in the first months of the occupation,” it said in a statement. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. Five people have been injured in Kyiv as Russia launched a fresh assault across Ukraine in the early hours of Monday, with explosions reported in the capital as well as in the Black Sea city of Odesa and in the southern region of Kherson. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that three people were injured in the city’s Solomyanskyi district and two others injured when drone wreckage fell on to at two-storey building in the Sviatoshyn district. “Likely as a result of debris falling on a parked car in the yard of a residential building, the car caught fire,” the city’s military administration added in a post on Telegram. “There is a recorded fall of debris on a residential building.” Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Livingstone. At least five people have been wounded by Russian strikes on Kyiv in the early hours of Monday, city officials have said, as Moscow launched another large-scale attack on Ukraine. Three people were also injured in blasts in Kyiv’s Solomyanskyi district and two others were injured when drone wreckage fell on to the Sviatoshyn district, both west of the capital’s centre, mayor Vitali Klitschko said on his Telegram messaging channel. Sviatoshyn, on the western edge of Kyiv, is a historical neighbourhood of the capital. Witnesses said they have heard numerous explosions in Kyiv, with local officials saying that air defence systems were repelling the attacks. It comes amid fears for the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, as Russia evacuates 1,679 people, including 660 children, from areas nearby. The head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, warned at the weekend that the situation around the plant has become “potentially dangerous” as Moscow-installed officials began evacuating people from nearby areas. Ukraine is expected to start soon a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory, including in the Zaporizhzhia region. Other key developments: An explosion was also heard overnight following a missile attack that hit the Black Sea city of Odesa, a local Ukrainian official said, and Ukrainian media reported sounds of explosions in the southern region of Kherson. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group appears to have ditched plans to withdraw from Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, saying they had been promised more arms by Moscow. Ukraine’s general in charge of the defence of the besieged city said late on Sunday that Russia had intensified shelling and hoped to take Bakhmut by Tuesday, Victory Day in Russia, the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war.

The UN nuclear agency’s chief said yesterday that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) “remains perilous” after a Russian missile strike this month disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Since a Russian strike on 9 March, the plant has relied on a single backup power line that remains “disconnected and under repair”, according to Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. “Nuclear safety at the ZNPP remains in a precarious state,” Grossi said in a statement on Wednesday. “I once again call for a commitment from all sides to secure nuclear safety and security protection at the plant.” The plant’s lack of access to the grid and necessary repair work on its last emergency power line could cause a complete loss of power, making it reliant on diesel generators for the seventh time since Russia captured it a year ago, Grossi said. What else is happening? President Vladimir Putin’s ally Dmitry Medvedev has said this morning that any attempt to arrest Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for him would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. US navy rejects China claim that warship ‘illegally’ entered part of South China Sea The US has denied Chinese claims that a US destroyer was driven out from waters around the contested Paracel Islands after it “illegally” entered the area in the South China Sea. In a statement on Thursday, the Chinese military said the guided-missile destroyer USS Milius illegally intruded into China’s territorial waters without the approval of the government, undermining peace and stability in the busy waterway. The US navy, however, said this was false. “The USS Milius is conducting routine operations in the South China Sea and was not expelled. The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows,” a statement from the US Navy 7th Fleet said. Where are the Paracel Islands? They are a disputed archipelago spread across about 7 sq km in the South China Sea. China has de facto control of the islands and has built installations and outposts, but Taiwan and Vietnam also claim ownership. What did the US say? The US’s Indo-Pacific Command at the time said China’s statement was “false” and that the US ship was conducting a freedom of navigation operation (Fonop) in line with international law. The Fonop sought to challenge restrictions imposed by various parties – including China, Taiwan and Vietnam – on “innocent passage” through the disputed area, and to challenge China’s claim of straight baselines that enclose the Paracel Islands. Trump lawyer ordered to hand over notes in Mar-a-Lago documents inquiry Donald Trump’s main lawyer – who was involved in turning over classified-marked documents at the Mar-a-Lago resort to the justice department last year – must provide his notes and audio transcripts to the criminal investigation into the former president after a federal appeals court rejected two efforts to block the order. The US appeals court for the DC circuit rejected on Wednesday two separate appeals from the former president and his lawyer Evan Corcoran to stop a sealed order, piercing attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine protections issued in a court decision last week. In losing the appeal – a major defeat for Trump – Corcoran must provide additional testimony and produce documents to the grand jury hearing evidence about Trump’s potential unauthorized retention of national security materials at Mar-a-Lago, and possible obstruction of justice. The obstruction part of the investigation is centered on Trump’s incomplete compliance with a subpoena in May that demanded the return of any classified-marked documents in his possession. That was after documents he returned earlier to the National Archives included 200 that were classified. What is happening in the Dominion case? The full trial in the case is scheduled to begin on 17 April but one side may have won already, argues Sam Levine. The core of Dominion’s $1.6bn case against Fox consists of words that came from the mouths of Fox’s employees. Regardless of what happens in the case, Dominion may have already won: the messages offer a significant historical record of how top officials at one of the country’s most powerful media organizations aired information they knew was false when US democracy was under attack.

Stat of the day: US Federal Reserve raises interest rates a quarter-point amid banking turmoil Facing the worst banking crisis since 2008 and the highest inflation rate in a generation, the Federal Reserve chose to keep fighting price rises and announced another hike in interest rates. The US central bank announced yesterday that its benchmark interest rate would rise another quarter of a percentage point to a range of 4.75% to 5% – its ninth consecutive rate rise and the highest rate since 2007. A year ago interest rates were close to zero. The latest increase was smaller than the half-point increase that some had expected before a series of bank collapses shook global markets. In a statement, the Fed said the impact of the banking crisis was “uncertain” but that inflation “remains elevated”.

Climate check: new climate paper calls big US oil firms to be charged with homicide Oil companies have come under increasing legal scrutiny and face allegations of defrauding investors, racketeering and a wave of other lawsuits. But a new paper argues there’s another way to hold big oil accountable for climate damage: trying companies for homicide. The striking and seemingly radical legal theory is laid out in a paper accepted for publication in the Harvard Environmental Law Review. In it, the authors argue fossil fuel companies “have not simply been lying to the public, they have been killing members of the public at an accelerating rate, and prosecutors should bring that crime to the public’s attention”. “What’s on their ledger in terms of harm … there’s nothing like it in human history,” said David Arkush, one of the paper’s authors.

Air raid alerts were heard across all over the country as Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, urged people to stay in shelters. Russian forces launched 70 missiles at Ukraine in its latest “large-scale attack on crucial infrastructure facilities,” Ukraine’s armed forces said. At least seven people have been killed – including a 17-year-old girl – and 36 injured after a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, according officials. Oleksii Kuleba, head of the regional military administration, said the entire Kyiv region was without electricity after Moscow’s airstrikes targeted critical infrastructure. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, has said the entire western Ukrainian city is “without light” following Russian strikes. Sadovyi warned that there would be “interruptions” with the city’s water supply and that he was awaiting additional information from energy experts. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm, Energoatom, has said power units of three Ukrainian nuclear power plants were switched off after Russian missile strikes across the country. In a statement, it said “due to a decrease in frequency in the energy system of Ukraine” emergency protection was activated at the Rivne, Pivdennoukrainsk and Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plants. Russian missile strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure caused blackouts across half of neighbouring Moldova, the deputy prime minister of Moldova said. Moldelectrica, the state-owned energy firm, is working to reconnect more than 50% of the country to electricity, Andrei Spînu, said. Moldova’s foreign affairs minister, Nicu Popescu, said he has asked for Russia’s ambassador to be summoned. The UN’s security council will hold an urgent meeting on Wednesday on Russia’s latest strikes at the request of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy said Ukrainians are “unbreakable” and that the country will rebuild damaged infrastructure and “get through all of this”. A newborn baby was killed after an overnight Russian rocket attack struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s state emergency service said that a woman with her two-day-old baby and a doctor had been in the facility in the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia, that was destroyed. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said warned the Ukrainian capital faces “the worst winter since World War II” after Russian attacks on the city’s energy infrastructure. Residents in Kyiv had to be ready for the “worst case scenario” of widespread power cuts at low temperatures in which parts of the capital would have to be evacuated, he said in an interview with the German newspaper Bild. A Ukrainian security official has said suspected Russian citizens, cash and documents were seized in a raid on a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv and other Orthodox sites. The raid, which took place on Tuesday, was part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, said. The Russian foreign ministry criticised Ukraine as “godless”, “wild” and “immoral” on Wednesday for raiding the the 1,000-year-old Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex – or Kyiv Monastery of the Caves – early on Tuesday. The European parliament came under “sophisticated cyberattacks” officials said, hours after it voted to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. The president of the European parliament, Roberta Metsola, said a pro-Kremlin group has claimed responsibility for the denial of service attack on the European parliament’s website. The European parliament has declared Russia “a terrorist regime” over its brutal war on Ukraine. In a non-binding resolution approved by a large majority of MEPs, the European parliament urged the EU’s 27 member states to make the same designation “with all the negative consequences this implies”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed the declaration. The US has announced a new $400m (£332.5m) aid package to Ukraine which will include weapons, munitions and air defence equipment. The package also includes more than 200 generators to help Ukraine deal with power outages caused by Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog met a Russian delegation in Istanbul on Wednesday to discuss safety at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the watchdog said. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling at the weekend, leading to renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster, Reuters reported. The UK is sending helicopters to Ukraine for the first time, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has announced. Three Sea King helicopters will be provided, with the first already in Ukraine, according to PA Media. Wallace also said an extra 10,000 artillery rounds were being sent to help Ukraine secure the territory it has recaptured from the invading forces in recent weeks. Germany has angrily dismissed claims by Boris Johnson that in the run-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine it said it would be better for Ukraine to fold than to become embroiled in a long war. Johnson, interviewed by CNN, also claimed that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was in denial about the threat of invasion, and that Italy, led at the time by Mario Draghi, said it could not help because it was so dependent on Russian hydrocarbons. Russia has probably launched a number of Iranian manufactured uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) against Ukraine since September, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said. It’s also likely that Russia has nearly exhausted its current stock of Iran-made weapons and will seek resupply, the ministry said in its daily intelligence update posted on Twitter. The Group of Seven nations are set to soon announce the price cap on Russian oil exports and the coalition will probably adjust the level a few times a year rather than monthly, a senior US Treasury official said on Tuesday. The G7, including the United States, along with the EU and Australia are slated to implement the price cap on sea-borne exports of Russian oil on 5 December, as part of sanctions intended to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainians needing basic services if Russia knocks out power stations and other facilities this winter can turn to special “invincibility centres,” president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday. Thousands of centres spread across the country will offer electricity, heat, water, internet service, mobile phone connections and a pharmacy, free of charge and around the clock. “If massive Russian strikes happen again and it’s clear power will not be restored for hours, the ‘invincibility centres’ will go into action with all key services,” Zelenskiy said. Ukrainians are likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, the head of a major energy provider said, as the government started free evacuations for people in Kherson to other regions. Kyiv will summon the Hungarian ambassador to protest that prime minister Viktor Orbán went to a football match wearing a scarf depicting some Ukrainian territory as part of Hungary, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said on Tuesday. Ukrainian media showed images of Orbán meeting a Hungarian footballer wearing a scarf which the outlet Ukrainska Pravda said depicted a map of “Greater Hungary” including territory that is now part of the neighbouring states of Austria, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia, Serbia and Ukraine. Russia’s Gazprom has threatened to cut its gas flows to Europe via Ukraine as early as next week. In a statement, the Russian state-owned energy giant said some gas flows being kept in Ukraine were actually meant for Moldova, and accused Kyiv of obstructing the delivery of 52.52m cubic metres from transiting to Moldova. In Crimea, Russian air defences were activated and two drone attacks were repelled on Tuesday, including one targeting a power station near Sevastopol, the regional governor said. Sevastopol is the home port of Russia’s Black Sea fleet. Russian-installed Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev called for calm and said no damage had been caused. The Polish president spoke to a hoax caller pretending to be France’s Emmanuel Macron on the night that a missile hit a village near the Ukrainian border, his office has admitted. “Emmanuel, believe me, I am extra careful,” Duda tells the caller in a recording of the call posted on the internet. “I don’t want to have war with Russia and believe me, I am extra careful, extra careful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/oct/24/nsw-treasurer-matt-kean-says-federal-nationals-can-resign-from-the-ministry-if-they-dont-back-net-zero","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-24T00:43:33Z","webTitle":"NSW treasurer Matt Kean says federal Nationals ‘can resign from the ministry’ if they don’t back net zero ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/oct/24/nsw-treasurer-matt-kean-says-federal-nationals-can-resign-from-the-ministry-if-they-dont-back-net-zero","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/oct/24/nsw-treasurer-matt-kean-says-federal-nationals-can-resign-from-the-ministry-if-they-dont-back-net-zero","fields":{"headline":"NSW treasurer Matt Kean says federal Nationals ‘can resign from the ministry’ if they don’t back net zero ","bodyText":"The New South Wales treasurer, Matt Kean, says the Nationals will need to decide if they want to resign and “support a Labor government” if they don’t back a federal commitment of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The comments come ahead of a critical Nationals party room meeting in Canberra on Sunday afternoon, which will consider the party’s position after it sent a list of demands to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Thursday. Morrison is hoping to clinch the support of the Nationals before he heads to Glasgow next week for the United Nations climate summit, but has made clear amid the high-stakes negotiations that the final decision will be up to cabinet. Nationals’ cabinet ministers – including the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, and Senate leader, Bridget McKenzie – would need to resign if they refused to back the cabinet position, a move that would lead to turmoil within the government and potentially trigger an election. Kean, who successfully secured the support of the NSW Nationals for a target of halving emissions by 2030, said he believed the coalition at a federal level should also pursue an “ambitious” interim goal that reflected the average of state emission reduction targets of about 35%. “I want to see the prime minister lead the world when it comes to taking action on climate change because it is in our economic interests to do so,” Kean told ABC’s Insiders program. “We know that there is an economic arms race under way for the next generation of jobs, investments, export opportunities and economic prosperity, and I want to see Australia at the head of the pack to grab those opportunities and set us up for a more prosperous future.” When asked if Morrison should forge ahead with cuts without the support of the junior Coalition partner, Kean said the prime minister should “continue to act in the nation’s interest.” “And if the Nats won’t get on board, they have a very clear choice: they can resign from the ministry and support a Liberal Government, or they can resign from the ministry and support a Labor government,” he said. “Now, I know what the best path forward for our country is and that’s a strong National-Liberal Coalition government putting the interests of our nation first. That’s what we’ve done in New South Wales and I know that that is what will happen in Canberra.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The deputy Nationals leader, David Littleproud, said the party room had only looked at the revised technology roadmap “just over a week ago”, but would resolve its position on Sunday. “Our party room has worked pragmatically, respectfully as we possible could and we will hopefully get to a resolution one way or another today,” he told Sky News. In response to suggestions the party was demanding a change to legislation to explore the potential of nuclear power, Littleproud said the idea was not electorally popular. “Nuclear is something the Nationals party obviously stands firmly behind as a party room but we understand you have got to educate before you legislate.” “The electorate isn’t necessarily there with us at the moment. We have to be pragmatic about that. You have still got to win elections.” Kean said MPs advocating nuclear were “pursuing a fantasy”. “People talking about nuclear to solve our current needs are chasing a unicorn. It may have a role to play in the future as technology evolving, so I won’t rule it out, but right now I’m focusing on things that will work,” Kean said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/apr/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-heads-to-poland-as-macron-and-von-der-leyen-arrive-in-china","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-05T17:54:01Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: anyone supporting Moscow in conflict is an ‘accomplice’, Macron says during China visit – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-heads-to-poland-as-macron-and-von-der-leyen-arrive-in-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/apr/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-heads-to-poland-as-macron-and-von-der-leyen-arrive-in-china","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: anyone supporting Moscow in conflict is an ‘accomplice’, Macron says during China visit – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Military honours, tributes and praise welcomed Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his wife, Olena Zelenska, to Poland on Monday. Zelenskiy and his wife, Olena Zelenska, were welcomed in Warsaw by President Andrzej Duda, who awarded Zelenskiy with Poland’s oldest and highest civilian distinction, The Order of the White Eagle. Poland would send 14 MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, Duda said at a joint news appearance with Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy thanked the Polish leader, government and people for standing “shoulder to shoulder” with Ukraine and giving fleeing Ukrainians shelter. Poland has led the way in mobilising western military and political support for Kyiv since the start of Russia’s full-fledged invasion 13 months ago. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, met Russian officials in Kaliningrad on Wednesday for talks on the Moscow-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. Grossi visited the plant last week, where he said the situation had grown worse and military activity around the site had intensified in recent months. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukrainian troops face a difficult situation in the eastern city of Bakhmut, but that Kyiv will take the “corresponding” decisions to protect them if they risk being encircled by Russian forces. The Ukrainian president, at a news conference in Poland on Wednesday, said Kyiv’s troops in Bakhmut sometimes advanced a little only to be pushed back by Russian forces, but that they remained inside the city. The president of Belarus and close ally of Vladimir Putin, Alexander Lukashenko, arrived in Moscow for a meeting with the Russian leader, Belarusian state-run Belta news agency has reported. Lukashenko and Putin will hold a meeting on Wednesday evening, where the pair will “discuss a broad range of matters concerning Belarusian-Russian relations”, it said. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus demonstrated that a Russia-China joint statement amounted to just “empty promises”. The Nato chief noted that Russia was becoming more and more dependent on China, partly as a result of international sanctions imposed on Moscow over its war in Ukraine. France’s president Emmanuel Macron has warned that anyone helping “aggressor” Russia in the Ukraine conflict would become an “accomplice”. The French leader arrived in Beijing for a three-day state visit during which he hopes to dissuade Xi Jinping from supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine while also developing European trade ties with Beijing. The six Leopard 2A4 tanks Spain has promised to send to Ukraine will leave the country in the second half of April, defence minister Margarita Robles told state broadcaster TVE on Wednesday, pushing back the estimated shipment date. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s and had been mothballed in reserve, requiring refitting and battle readiness tests after initial doubts as to whether they could go into combat again. It would be “very hard” to lift Russia’s suspension from UEFA until the war in Ukraine ends, the president of the European football governing body has said. Aleksander Čeferin, at a news conference in Lisbon, said: My personal opinion is: that, until the war stops, it will be very hard for us to change anything. Both UEFA and world football’s governing body, FIFA, suspended all Russian international and club teams from their competitions in February 2022. Footage being shared on social media shows a small plume of black smoke rising from the Russian defence ministry’s headquarters following state media reports that a fire has broken out at the building in the centre of Moscow. There have been no details on any casualties or the cause of the fire. A fire has broken out at a building belonging to Russia’s defence ministry in the centre of Moscow, the Russian state-run Tass new agency is reporting, citing emergency services. More details to follow. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s official visit to Poland. The president of Belarus and close ally of Vladimir Putin, Alexander Lukashenko, has arrived in Moscow for a meeting with the Russian leader, Belarusian state-run Belta news agency has reported. Lukashenko and Putin will hold a meeting this evening, where the pair will “discuss a broad range of matters concerning Belarusian-Russian relations”, it said. The pair will also discuss “the international situation and the measures being taken to ensure security”, Belta said. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus demonstrated that a Russia-China joint statement amounted to just “empty promises”. Moscow and Beijing issued the joint statement following talks between Putin and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in the Russian capital last month. In the statement, both countries said it was necessary to halt actions that further fuelled the conflict in Ukraine. Just days later, Putin said Moscow had reached an agreement with Minsk to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. Stoltenberg, speaking to reporters at Nato’s headquarters in Brussels today, said the Russian leader’s announcement followed Moscow and Beijing jointly declaring countries should not deploy nuclear weapons outside their borders. He said this showed such statements are “empty promises and what we need to watch closely is what Russia is doing”. The Nato chief noted that Russia was becoming more and more dependent on China, partly as a result of international sanctions imposed on Moscow over its war in Ukraine. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has arrived in Poland for an official visit to a close ally that has led the way in mobilising western military and political support for Kyiv since the start of Russia’s full-fledged invasion 13 months ago.

The French leader arrived in Beijing for a three-day state visit during which he hopes to dissuade Xi Jinping from supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine while also developing European trade ties with Beijing. Poland’s agriculture minister Henryk Kowalczyk has formally resigned from his post, saying he decided to quit the position due to the European Commission’s decision to extend duty free imports for Ukrainian grain until June 2024. Export bottlenecks caused by Russia’s invasion mean large quantities of Ukrainian grains, which are cheaper than those produced in the EU have ended up in central European states, hitting prices and sales of local farmers. A Ukrainian drone has crashed near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Russia’s state-run RIA news agency cited a Russian officer as saying on Wednesday, as the chief of the global nuclear watchdog was expected in Russia for talks on the plant’s security. The six Leopard 2A4 tanks Spain has promised to send to Ukraine will leave the country in the second half of April, defence minister Margarita Robles told state broadcaster TVE on Wednesday, pushing back the estimated shipment date. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s and had been mothballed in reserve, requiring refitting and battle readiness tests after initial doubts as to whether they could go into combat again. The United States is working through the process to determine if Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich’s detention by Russia is “wrongful”, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Wednesday, adding that it would soon be completed. “It’s something that we’re working through very deliberately, but expeditiously as well. And I’ll let that process play out. In my own mind, there’s no doubt that he’s being wrongfully detained by Russia,” Reuters reports Blinken said at a press conference in Brussels. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, is reporting that explosions have been heard in Kherson. US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said on Wednesday she had spoken with her Russian counterpart Vassily Nebenzia to demand the immediate release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. Gershkovich was arrested and charged with espionage in Russia last week. Reuters reports Thomas-Greenfield said she spoke with Nebenzia on Tuesday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukrainian troops face a difficult situation in the eastern city of Bakhmut, but that Kyiv will take the “corresponding” decisions to protect them if they risk being encircled by Russian forces. The Ukrainian president, at a news conference in Poland, said Kyiv’s troops in Bakhmut sometimes advanced a little only to be pushed back by Russian forces, but that they remained inside the city. He said: We are in Bakhmut and the enemy does not control it. He added: For me, the most important is not to lose our soldiers and of course if there is a moment of even hotter events and the danger we could lose our personnel because of encirclement – of course the corresponding correct decisions will be taken by generals there. The more ammunition Kyiv receives from western partners, the faster it would be able fight back in Bakhmut and elsewhere, he added: There is success in some districts of Bakhmut – we’re going forward. Or there’s no (success) and we’re again leaving for positions. Vladimir Putin has attended a ceremony at the Kremlin where he met the new ambassadors to Moscow and accepted their diplomatic credentials. Among the 17 new ambassadors attending the ceremony on Wednesday was Lynne Tracy, the US’s new ambassador to Russia. Putin told Tracy in an address that US support for a revolution in Ukraine in 2014 had led to the current situation where Russia and Ukraine were in conflict. Relations with Washington were in a deep crisis that was “based on fundamentally different approaches to the formation of the modern world order”, the Russian leader said. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has met Russian officials in Kaliningrad for talks on the Moscow-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. An IAEA spokesperson said earlier this week that Grossi would visit the Russian Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad on Wednesday to discuss the safety of the nuclear plant, which is near the frontline of fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. Grossi visited the plant last week, where he said the situation had grown worse and military activity around the site had intensified in recent months. Here’s more from Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, who said he would discuss developments in the Ukraine war with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to Turkey this week. Ankara is working with the UN to solve issues regarding grain and fertiliser exports via the Black Sea, Çavuşoğlu added. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has arrived in Poland for an official visit to a close ally that has led the way in mobilising western military and political support for Kyiv since the start of Russia’s full-fledged invasion 13 months ago. Zelenskiy and Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, were welcomed in Warsaw with military honours, tributes and praise from President Andrzej Duda, who awarded Zelenskiy with Poland’s oldest and highest civilian distinction, The Order of the White Eagle. Duda told Zelenskiy that he was a“unique man” and that he had “no doubt that your attitude, together with the bravery of the nation, has saved Ukraine”. Poland will send 14 MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, Duda said at a joint news appearance with Zelenskiy: Four MiG-29s that remained in storage have been handed over to the Ukrainian armed forces in recent months. Four MiGs are now being given, so eight in total.. We are ready... to give six more that are currently being prepared. We assume they could be transferred soon. Zelenskiy thanked the Polish leader, government and people for standing “shoulder to shoulder” with Ukraine and giving fleeing Ukrainians shelter. He said: You have not abandoned Ukraine, you stood with us shoulder to shoulder, and we are grateful to you. We believe this is a historic relationship. The visit – Zelenskiy’s first official visit to Poland since Russia’s invasion in February 2022 – stood out from his previous visits to the US, Britain, France and Belgium because it was announced in advance, without the secrecy of past trips. It is also unusual because the Ukrainian president is joined by his wife. Poland has taken in more than a million Ukrainian refugees since Russia invaded, and has played an instrumental role in persuading other western powers to supply battle tanks and other weaponry to Ukraine. It was also the first country to deliver fighter jets to Ukraine. During his visit, Zelenskiy is expected to meet with Duda and Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, and sign bilateral agreements. Polish officials had previously said talks would focus on developments on the Ukrainian front lines, international support and economic cooperation. Zelenskiy will also speak to Ukrainian refugees and Polish members of the public as well as business leaders who could be involved in rebuilding Ukraine. Here’s more from President Emmanuel Macron, who has arrived in Beijing for a three-day state visit. Speaking to journalists, the French leader said anyone helping “aggressor” Russia in the Ukraine conflict would become an “accomplice”. Macron said: We have decided since the beginning of the conflict to help the victim, and we have also made it very clear that anyone helping the aggressor would be an accomplice in breach of international law. He added that it was not in China’s interest to provide weapons to Russia in its war against Ukraine: China’s interest isn’t to have a lasting war. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, has awarded his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy with the Order of the White Eagle during a ceremony at the presidential palace in Warsaw. The order is “the oldest and highest Polish award” and is presented to “outstanding individuals,” Duda said at the ceremony. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has said Sweden needs to take further steps for Ankara to ratify its Nato membership bid. Çavuşoğlu also told reporters that he had discussed Sweden’s Nato bid and developments regarding Ankara’s purchase of F-16 fighter jets with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Çavuşoğlu and Blinken met on the sidelines of a Nato meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, on the day that Finland formally joined the military alliance. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has said China can play a “major role” in the war in Ukraine because of its close relationship with Russia. Macron, speaking shortly after he landed in Beijing for a state visit, said maintaining dialogue with China was essential and that Moscow could not be allowed to have an exclusive dialogue with Beijing. He told reporters at the French embassy in Beijing: We hear increasingly loud voices expressing a strong concern about the future of relations between the west and China that in some form lead to the conclusion that there is an inescapable spiral of mounting tensions. The French leader, who touched down ahead of the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, is on his first trip to China since 2019 and hopes to refute any sense of an “inescapable spiral” of tension between Beijing and the west. Both Macron and Von der Leyen have said they want to persuade China to use its influence over Russia to bring peace in Ukraine, or at least prevent Beijing from directly supporting Moscow.

The first images have arrived of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Warsaw where he and his wife, Olena Zelenska, have met Poland’s President Andrzej Duda and his wife, Agata Kornhauser-Duda. Turkish coastguards were searching for nine missing crew members of a Ukraine-bound commercial ship that sank close to Turkey’s southern province of Antalya. The Guinea Bissau-flagged ship had sailed from Turkey’s Iskenderun port for Ukraine’s Izmail port, the coast guard said. Reuters report five crew members were rescued by helicopters and other ships passing by the area, it said in a statement. The six Leopard 2A4 tanks Spain has promised to send to Ukraine will leave the country in the second half of April, defence minister Margarita Robles told state broadcaster TVE on Wednesday, pushing back the estimated shipment date. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s and had been mothballed in reserve, requiring refitting and battle readiness tests after initial doubts as to whether they could go into combat again. Spain last month said it expected to send the tanks after the 9 April Easter holiday. It had committed to sending a total of ten tanks to Ukraine, and Reuters reports Robles said the armed forces had started repairing the remaining four. Poland’s agriculture minister Henryk Kowalczyk has formally resigned from his post, saying he decided to quit the position due to the European Commission’s decision to extend duty free imports for Ukrainain grain until June 2024. Polish farmers had called for the introduction of tariffs. “As it is clear that this demand will not be met by the European Commission at this point, I decided to resign from the post of agriculture minister,” Kowalczk said. Export bottlenecks caused by Russia’s invasion mean large quantities of Ukrainian grains, which are cheaper than those produced in the European Union have ended up in central European states, hitting prices and sales of local farmers. Reuters reports the prime ministers of five states including Poland wrote to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Friday to demand action on Ukrainian agricultural imports. They said tariffs may have to be reintroduced if the influx of grain and other products from Ukraine cannot be stopped by other means. Reuters has a quick snap to report that Polish agriculture minister Henryk Kowalczyk will resign from his post amid rising anger among farmers over the impact of Ukrainian grain imports on prices. The move coincides with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visiting Poland, a trip which some farmers have threatened to disrupt. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us over the news wires, showing Ukrainian troops in Donetsk oblast. French president Emmanuel Macron is currently arriving at Beijing airport for his state visit to China. The UK’s Ministry of Defence’s intelligence briefing about the Ukraine war today concentrates on the finances of the Russian state. The UK suggests that Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin’s recent announcement that “a move to issuing some of Russia’s sovereign debt in foreign currencies was ‘under development’” indicates that Russia is anticipating financial support from other countries, which could go to help support the war effort. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said on Wednesday at the Nato summit in Brussels that the defence alliance needs to strengthen its relations with global like-minded partners. After Finland joined Nato yesterday, the Nato summit in Vilnius in July should welcome Sweden to the alliance, Reuters reports Baerbock added.

The regional authority in Ukraine’s Sumy oblast has reported that the night passed without any shelling, according to Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster. After more than 1,200 days in charge of the European Commission, which forms and enforces policy for 450 million Europeans, Ursula von der Leyen is in the final third of her term. It has been a tumultuous period: she took office in 2019 with ambitious pledges to tackle the climate emergency, but was soon confronted by a once-a-century pandemic and the biggest war on European soil since 1945. In previous crises “the EU realised that it is still very much a legislative machine, and there was no headquarters, no general to lead the crisis management”, said one senior EU official. “Now in two consecutive crises, Covid and Ukraine, we have the headquarters and we have the general.” As Von der Leyen heads to China, read our profile of the EU Commission president: A Ukrainian drone has crashed near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Russia’s RIA news agency cited a Russian officer as saying on Wednesday, as the chief of the global nuclear watchdog was expected in Russia for talks on the plant’s security. International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi was due to travel to Russia’s Kaliningrad region on Wednesday, a week after visiting the Zaporizhzhia facility in southern Ukraine, which is controlled by Russian forces. According to the Russian military officer cited by RIA, a Polish-made drone weighing more than 2 kg (4.4 pounds) had crashed near the plant. The news agency did not say when. Grossi has been pushing for a demilitarised zone around Europe’s largest nuclear facility, which has come under repeated shelling, with Russia and Ukraine have blamed on each other. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has crossed the border and is now in Poland ahead of his official visit to the capital Warsaw, the Polish president’s foreign policy adviser said on Wednesday. “I can say that President Zelenskiy has crossed the Polish border,” Marcin Przydacz told private broadcaster TVN24. We’ll have more shortly. More now on Zelenskiy’s trip to Poland: The Polish public overwhelming supports Ukrainians in their war with Russia. An Ipsos poll said 82% of Poles think Nato and EU countries should back Ukraine until it wins. Nonetheless, Zelenskiy’s visit takes place amid mounting anger in rural Poland over the impact of imports of Ukrainian grain, which have pushed down prices in several states in the EU’s eastern wing. “During talks with President Zelenskiy, we will certainly discuss Ukrainian grain and various agricultural products, because we want any trade with Ukraine not to destabilise our market,” Morawiecki said. Tariffs on Ukrainian agricultural imports may need to be reintroduced if an influx of products pushing down prices in EU markets can’t be halted by other means, the premiers of five eastern states said in a letter published on Friday to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Washington unveiled $2.6bn more in military assistance for Zelenskiy’s government on Tuesday, including three air surveillance radars, anti-tank rockets and fuel trucks. The Russian embassy in Washington reacted to the announcement by accusing the United States of wanting to drag out the conflict as long as possible, Russian news agency TASS said. The United States has pledged more than $35.2bn worth of security assistance since the start of the war. European Union executive head Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron land in China today, where they will be hoping to “reset” ties with an important economic partner while broaching thorny issues like Ukraine and trade risks. Macron last visited China in 2019 while it will be Von der Leyen’s first trip since becoming European Commission president that year. Since then, China’s strict pandemic controls forced all diplomatic meetings online as relations with Europe soured: first due to a stalled investment pact in 2021 and then Beijing’s refusal to condemn Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Macron’s adviser said was an attempt to “reset” diplomatic and economic relations with China. “It’s not the time to announce business deals or big new investments,” said Noah Barkin, an analyst with Rhodium Group. “It would essentially be a vote of confidence in the Chinese economy and send the message that France is not on board with the US approach.” Von der Leyen has said the EU must cut risks in ties with Beijing, including limiting Chinese access to sensitive technology and reducing reliance for key inputs such as critical minerals, as well as batteries, solar panels and other clean tech products. Macron invited Von der Leyen on the trip as a way to project European unity, after French officials criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for going solo to China late last year. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is expected to visit Poland today, the Polish president’s foreign affairs adviser Marcin Przydacz said on Monday. “The visit will take place at the invitation of President (Andrzej) Duda. There will be long, broad talks, not only about the security situation, but also about economic and political support”, Przydacz told private radio RMF. “It will be an official visit.” He added Zelenskiy would meet Poles and Ukrainians who have taken refuge in Poland on Wednesday at Warsaw’s Castle square. Zelenskiy last met his Polish counterpart in December 2022 during his trip home from the United States. Poland is Ukraine’s neighbour and the two countries have deep historical ties. Many Ukrainians fled their country after Russia’s invasion last year, with a large number seeking safety in Poland. Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest. Our top story this morning: Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is expected to visit Poland today, the Polish president’s foreign affairs adviser Marcin Przydacz said on Monday. Zelenskiy last met his Polish counterpart in December 2022 during his trip home from the United States. French president Emmanuel Macron and European Union executive head Ursula von der Leyen arrive in China on Wednesday seeking to “reset” ties while broaching thorny issues like Ukraine and trade risks. US President Joe Biden on Tuesday held a call with Macron to discuss the visit, the White House said, adding that they also spoke about maintaining support for Ukraine against Russia’s invasion. Here are the other key recent developments: Finland has become the 31st member of Nato after its foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, signed an accession document and handed it to the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, at a ceremony in Brussels. Sergei Shoigu, Russia’s defence minister, said the accession of Finland increased the risks of wider conflict. US president Joe Biden welcomed Finlands’ ascension and urged Turkey and Hungary to conclude their ratification processes for Sweden to join. Ukraine hopes to receive two more tranches worth $1.8bn from the International Monetary Fund this year under its newly approved four-year lending program, top Ukrainian central bank officials said on Tuesday. Ukraine this week received the first $2.7bn tranche under the program, which is a part of a bigger $115bn global package of support. Britain has blocked the UN webcast of an informal Security Council meeting on Ukraine on Wednesday, at which Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights is due to speak. The international criminal court wants to arrest the commissioner on war crimes charges. Such meetings are not held in the Security Council chamber and all 15 council members have to agree to allow it to be webcast by the United Nations. The US is trying to wreck Russia’s planned summit with African countries as part of efforts to isolate Moscow, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview published on Tuesday. Moscow is preparing for its second summit with African countries, scheduled for the end of July in St Petersburg. A Ukrainian soldier pleaded “partly guilty” on Tuesday at Russia’s first trial for war crimes in connection with its military campaign in Ukraine. Russian investigators formally charged Darya Trepova, a 26-year-old woman, with terrorism offences over the killing of the pro-war military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in a bomb blast in St Petersburg. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was arrested and charged with espionage in Russia last week, met his lawyers for the first time on Tuesday, editor-in-chief Emma Tucker said in a message to staff. “Evan’s health is good, and he is grateful for the outpouring of support from around the world,” Tucker said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, will travel to Moscow on Wednesday for two days of talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin has said. Lithuania’s parliament decided on Tuesday to ban Russian nationals from purchasing real estate in the Baltic country, citing risks to national security. Polish farmers are threatening to derail a visit to Warsaw by Volodymyr Zelenskiy over claims that Ukrainian grain is flooding their market, in a move that would provide Russia with valuable evidence of a crack in western solidarity. Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency has reported that the number of people injured in the St Petersburg cafe explosion that killed the prominent military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky has risen to 40."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/sep/07/pm-grills-peter-dutton-on-location-of-power-plants-amid-coalitions-nuclear-push","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T06:06:34Z","webTitle":"PM grills Peter Dutton on location of power plants amid Coalition’s nuclear push","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/07/pm-grills-peter-dutton-on-location-of-power-plants-amid-coalitions-nuclear-push","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/sep/07/pm-grills-peter-dutton-on-location-of-power-plants-amid-coalitions-nuclear-push","fields":{"headline":"PM grills Peter Dutton on location of power plants amid Coalition’s nuclear push","bodyText":"Peter Dutton has doubled down on Liberal support for nuclear power, pre-empting a review of its energy policy by arguing nuclear will be needed to support renewables. Dutton told the Minerals Council on Wednesday that Australia needs a “frank debate” about nuclear energy, suggesting that it has a “wonderful opportunity to add value” to its uranium resources. The comments sparked a demand from the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, in question time for the Liberals to nominate “where the plants are going to be”. On Wednesday Dutton confirmed that he appointed Ted O’Brien as shadow energy minister in part because a committee inquiry he chaired in 2019 recommended the partial lifting of the moratorium on nuclear energy to allow for “new and emerging nuclear technologies”. The Coalition is still reviewing its energy policy to develop an emissions reduction target before the next election and study nuclear energy to develop a “proper base of information”, according to comments Dutton made in the party room in August. On Wednesday the Liberal leader said “the imperative on all of us to create affordable and reliable and, where possible, emissions-reduced energy necessitates that we at least have a conversation about nuclear”. “[About] how that technology can play into the energy mix in the future? I think especially since Australia is home to one third of the world’s deposits of uranium. We have a wonderful opportunity to add value to that resource.” Dutton noted that former Labor prime minister, Bob Hawke “was strongly in favour of nuclear energy and couldn’t get it through the left of his party”. “John Howard to this day is very strongly in favour of nuclear energy as an option ... that crazy rightwinger in Canada, Justin Trudeau, is embracing small modular reactors.” Dutton posed the question: “If you don’t like coal and you don’t like gas, unless you believe clean hydrogen is about to be a reality, then what else firms up renewables? And I don’t know the answer to that question beyond nuclear.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dutton suggested nuclear energy could also help Australia “power up irrigation and open up thousands of square kilometres of export opportunities” before concluding the government should “at least allow” the community to have a debate about it. In August the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, ruled out consideration of nuclear power because he said “it is by far the most expensive form of energy”. “I mean, this is economic illiteracy from an opposition searching for relevance,” he told ABC News Breakfast. “[Nuclear] is slow to deploy. It couldn’t be deployed in Australia until 2030. “The CSIRO has made it very, very clear renewables are the cheapest form of energy. Nuclear is the most expensive. Why with rising energy prices you would put in the most expensive form of energy available is beyond me.” Later on Wednesday, the Liberals pursued Albanese in question time over his pre-election claims that Labor’s energy policy, including more renewables and upgrading the grid, could help save households $275 on their power bill. Albanese replied that the government stands by the modelling supporting the claim, and that Labor’s policy was based on the systems plan of the Australian Energy Market Operator, which identified it would “promote investment in renewables which is the cheapest form of energy”. Albanese said after “22 failed plans” the Coalition now wants “to go towards nuclear energy”. “And they can say, if you like, where the plants are going to be. I’ll look forward to their review, letting us know … [because] we know they have to be near urban areas and water.” While Labor raised the spectre of campaigning on the location of putative nuclear power plants, Dutton accused the government of asking Australians to sign up to an Indigenous voice to parliament “sight unseen”. “We have no idea what it means for the mining sector,” Dutton told the Minerals Council earlier. “We don’t know whether a voice that doesn’t represent the elders that you negotiate with or that your agreement is with in a particular location, now, they might be usurped and [the voice will] exercise a veto, right? That would damage your employees, that would damage your business.” Earlier, Dutton said it was an “inconvenient truth” for climate activists that “decarbonisation will require more mining”, due to critical minerals’ importance in renewable energy, batteries and electric vehicles. “I take some delight knowing it must keep them up at night.” Dutton said the Liberals don’t support “locking in” the 43% emissions reduction target in legislation because the “inflexible position” might disadvantage Australia if competitors did not meet their targets and it would make it “harder if not impossible” for government agencies to fund resources projects."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/06/peter-dutton-says-hes-not-afraid-of-nuclear-debate-after-advocate-named-shadow-energy-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-06T00:29:37Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton says he’s ‘not afraid’ of nuclear debate after advocate named shadow energy minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/06/peter-dutton-says-hes-not-afraid-of-nuclear-debate-after-advocate-named-shadow-energy-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/06/peter-dutton-says-hes-not-afraid-of-nuclear-debate-after-advocate-named-shadow-energy-minister","fields":{"headline":"Peter Dutton says he’s ‘not afraid’ of nuclear debate after advocate named shadow energy minister","bodyText":"Peter Dutton has confirmed that his frontbench pick for the opposition’s climate and energy portfolio signals he is up for a debate about nuclear power in Australia. In Sunday’s reshuffle the Liberal MP and nuclear power advocate Ted O’Brien was appointed to the shadow cabinet in the crucial portfolio. On Monday Dutton told ABC Radio National he was “not afraid to have a discussion on nuclear”, confirming he had considered O’Brien’s support for the form of power in deciding to take the fight to Labor on electricity prices and emissions reduction. In December 2019 O’Brien chaired a parliamentary committee that recommended the partial lifting of the moratorium on nuclear energy to allow for “new and emerging nuclear technologies”. The report won plaudits from some other Liberals in the party room and Nationals in the Senate, although O’Brien has reportedly said the ban should not be lifted without bipartisan support. Dutton said O’Brien was a “very considered person”, praising his work on the latest generation of nuclear power – “the small modular nuclear generation which can power up to 100,000 houses”. “If we want to have a legitimate emissions reduction, if we want to lower emissions reduction, that’s exactly the path President Macron has embarked on in France, it’s what prime minister Johnson is talking about in the United Kingdom,” he told Radio National. “I don’t think we should be afraid to talk about any technology that’s going to have the ability to reduce emissions and electricity prices. That’s something we can consider in time. I don’t think we should rule things out simply because it’s unfashionable to talk about them.” Labor has long called on the Coalition to rule out the “fantasy” of nuclear power, and threatened to campaign against it in communities where plants had been proposed, such as Townsville. A nuclear reactor is expected to take at least 15 years to build. Although small “modular” reactors show promise, the CSIRO science agency has suggested they won’t be affordable until 2050. The Australian Nuclear Association has said nuclear power would only be cost competitive with gas and coal generation if Australia adopted a price for carbon emissions, an anathema to the Coalition since its repeal of Labor’s interim carbon price. The conservative thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs released a poll, taken in April, finding that most Australians (53%) agreed with the proposition that “Australia should build nuclear power plants to supply electricity and reduce carbon emissions”. About a quarter (23%) disagreed, and 24% neither agreed nor disagreed. On Monday the Liberal senator Hollie Hughes, the shadow assistant minister for climate change and energy, said she was “not personally in favour” of extending carbon emission reduction targets. Hughes told ABC News Breakfast that Australia “could shut everything down tomorrow and all go live in trees” and the impact on total global emissions would be negligible. She suggested Australia should consider small modular nuclear energy. The Coalition reshuffle also saw Julian Leeser, an advocate of an Indigenous voice to parliament, appointed to the role of shadow attorney general and Indigenous affairs minister. Dutton said the Coalition was “very open to the discussion and what the government has to say” on the voice. “In principle, do we support anything that’s going to improve the situation of Indigenous Australians? Absolutely.” But he warned there “are things that can be done now in those communities that don’t need to wait for a referendum, and I would like to see those actions”. “Every government that I’ve been in, that I’ve witnessed … Liberal or Labor, has had good intention … of closing the gap. “There have been some successes and we should celebrate those successes, but that we’re still talking about sexual assault of women and children, now, and the domestic violence incidences at a record rate is completely and utterly deplorable.” Dutton also signalled greater efforts to recruit women to the Liberal party but ruled out the use of quotas. The shadow cabinet now contains 10 women, three in the Nationals and seven in the Liberals, with Sarah Henderson joining as shadow communications minister but Marise Payne stepping back into the cabinet secretary role. Dutton said the Liberals were “at a disadvantage” because women in the labour movement could run for office, then work for unions or industry super funds if they lost. “Business won’t do that for the Liberal party. A small businesswoman who is juggling an overdraft and trying to get her business up and running can’t afford to take six weeks off for a campaign, because her business goes broke. “So we need to come up with a different model, and that in my mind is the biggest inhibitor.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/mar/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-fears-war-could-be-hampered-by-washington-divisions-moscow-starts-drills-with-new-icbm","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-29T18:00:13Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: object found near Nord Stream 2 ‘no safety risk’; Bakhmut battle has ‘badly damaged’ Wagner forces – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-fears-war-could-be-hampered-by-washington-divisions-moscow-starts-drills-with-new-icbm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/mar/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-fears-war-could-be-hampered-by-washington-divisions-moscow-starts-drills-with-new-icbm","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: object found near Nord Stream 2 ‘no safety risk’; Bakhmut battle has ‘badly damaged’ Wagner forces – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has made a second visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine amid an escalation in the fighting around it. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: “It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked. Russia has stopped informing the US about its nuclear activities, including missile test launches, after Moscow suspended its participation in the New Start arms control treaty last month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said. The White House on Tuesday said the US had told Russia it would cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces after Moscow’s refusal to do so. Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand of troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday. Vladimir Putin has aimed to make the Yars missile system, which replaced the Topol system, part of Russia’s “invincible weapons” and the mainstay of the ground-based component of its nuclear arsenal. The German government has agreed to send an additional €12bn worth of military support to Ukraine. The Bundestag’s budget committee gave the green light on Wednesday for about €8bn to be spent directly on purchasing weapons and equipment for Ukraine. The other €4bn will go to the German military to replenish stocks. Spain will send six Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine after the Easter holiday, the Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles said on Wednesday. An explosion has been reported near a Russian military airbase in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, according to footage shared on social media. The Russian-appointed head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, posted to Telegram that “a UAV [drone] was shot down in the Simferopol region” and that there were “no casualties or damage”. Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group, has said the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has “practically destroyed” the Ukrainian army but that his forces have also been “badly damaged”. Vladimir Putin has conceded that sanctions imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine could bring about “negative” consequences for the country. Putin, in a televised meeting with the government, insisted Moscow was adapting to the penalties and that unemployment “remains at an all-time low”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Putin is an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia, despite Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Moscow. Zelenskiy also extended an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit Ukraine. “We are ready to see him here. I want to speak with him.” Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. He added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged Russians not to adopt children who she said were “stolen” from her country during the war and deported to Russia. Vereshchuk, posting to Telegram, said orphans had been “stolen in Ukraine” and allegedly given up for adoption in Russia. Poland has urged the EU to limit the amount of Ukrainian grain entering the bloc’s market, its prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said, amid anger among farmers over the effect of imports on Polish grain prices. Ukraine’s sports ministry has condemned what it said was a partial change of position by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in international competitions as neutrals. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, described the IOC’s decision as “shameful”. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. We’ll be back tomorrow. Thank you for following. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has made a second visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine amid an escalation in the fighting around it. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked. “I think it’s no secret that there is a significant increase in the number of troops in the region, and there is open talk about offensive and counter offensives,” he added. The plant is on the south bank of the Dnieper river, which forms the frontline at a time when Russian forces have attempted to conduct a series of offensives and Ukraine is widely expected to launch a counter-offensive in the coming months. Grossi was accompanying three IAEA inspectors who will replace an outgoing monitoring team and are due to stay at the site for the next two months, the seventh team to take up the rotating role since the agency’s presence was accepted by Kyiv and Moscow. The director general is also in Zaporizhzhia to continue efforts to negotiate protections for the plant, which would require the agreement of Ukrainian and Russian forces not to fire in or out of the area. “There have been different concepts that we have been working on. Initially we were focusing on the possibility of the establishment of a well-determined zone around the plant. Now the concept is evolving and refocusing more on the protection itself and the things that should be avoided,” he said on Wednesday. “It is a work in progress.” Read the full story here: The German government has agreed to send an additional €12bn worth of military support to Ukraine, in a further shift away from its traditional pacifist stance. The Bundestag’s budget committee gave the green light today for about €8bn to be spent directly on purchasing weapons and equipment for Ukraine, approving a request by the German defence ministry and foreign office. The other €4bn will go to the German military to replenish stocks. About €12bn in total will be released related to the Ukraine conflict over the next decade or so. Since the start of the Russian invasion, the German government has made available more than €14.2bn in support for Ukraine, according to the foreign office. In a statement, three lawmakers representing the coalition government on the committee said: With the money, Ukraine can directly buy armaments with the support of the German government. The move represents a “very important step with which we make it clear that we are supporting Ukraine in the long term in its fight against Putin,” said Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius. The agreement will allow supplies including armoured vehicles, tanks, and ammunition to be delivered to Ukraine in the coming years, according to a statement from the minister. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has responded to remarks by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov who earlier today said Russia’s “hybrid war” against “hostile states” will continue “for a long time”. Peskov and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, are both “wrong: the war can be ended diplomatically”, Podolyak posted to Twitter. He called on Russian forces to immediately withdraw from occupied parts of Ukraine, adding that “a reboot must happen in Moscow for that”. An explosion has been reported near a Russian military airbase in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, according to footage shared on social media. The Russian-appointed head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, posted to Telegram that “a UAV [drone] was shot down in the Simferopol region”. He added: It crashed in a field. There were no casualties or damage. It has not been possible to independently verify his claim. A letter from a Russian girl who drew anti-war pictures at school, addressed to her father who has reportedly fled house arrest after being sentenced to two years after being convicted of discrediting the armed force, has been made public. Alexei Moskalyov, a single parent from the town of Yefremov, 150 miles south of Moscow, was detained by police and placed under house arrest at the start of this month. His daughter Masha was moved to a state-run shelter. On Tuesday, a court spokesperson said Moskalyov had fled house arrest overnight and his whereabouts are currently not known. A human rights lawyer, Dmitry Zakhvatov, has since said Moskalyov had been in touch with him and sent him a copy of a letter that Masha had written him from the children’s home. The letter reads: Hi Dad, I really ask you not to get sick and not to worry. Everything is fine with me, I love you very much and know that you’re not guilty of anything. I am always on your side, and everything you do is right. It ends with “I love you” in English, and the words “you are a hero” inside a heart. The family said they had faced pressure from police since last April when Masha, a sixth-grader, refused to participate in a patriotic class at her school and made several drawings showing rockets being fired at a family standing under a Ukrainian flag and another that said “Glory to Ukraine!” School officials at the time summoned the police, who questioned the girl and threatened her father. He was eventually charged with discrediting the armed forces for his social media posts in which he called the Russian regime “terrorists” and described the Russian army as “rapists”. The high-profile case was criticised by Russian human rights groups and led to an online campaign to reunite father and daughter. Russian authorities have put a member of the feminist punk group Pussy Riot on a wanted list for criminal suspects, according to an interior ministry database. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova is on Russia’s federal wanted list, Russian news outlet Mediazona has reported. The entry said Tolokonnikova faces criminal charges, but it did not specify what the charges are. Tolokonnikova left Russia and reportedly lives in the US. She was designated a “foreign agent” by the Russian government in 2021. My colleague Zoe Williams interviewed Tolokonnikova in March last year. Vladimir Putin has conceded that sanctions imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine could bring about “negative” consequences for the country, but insisted Moscow was adapting to the penalties. Putin, in a televised meeting with the government, said: The sanctions imposed against the Russian economy in the medium term could really have a negative impact. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, has shared the clip: During the meeting, Putin said unemployment in Russia “remains at an all-time low” and that inflation is expected to “drop below 4%” by the end of March after soaring in spring last year. However the “return to a growth trajectory should not make us feel relaxed”, he said. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Tthe UN’s nuclear agency chief, Rafael Grossi, has said the situation is not improving at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after visiting Zaporizhzhia in an occupied region of Ukraine. While on the Russian-held territory, Grossi told Russian news agencies including Tass that “Obviously, the situation is not improving, on the contrary, hostilities around this territory are intensifying. All possible measures must be taken to protect the station from any attack.” Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group, has said the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has “practically destroyed” the Ukrainian army but that his forces have also been “badly damaged”. Russia has stopped informing the US about its nuclear activities, including missile test launches, after Moscow suspended its participation in the New Start arms control treaty last month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Russian president Vladimir Putin is an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia, despite Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Moscow. Zelenskiy suggested that Putin’s announcement shortly after Xi’s visit that he would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, closer to Nato territory, was meant to deflect from the fact that the Chinese leader’s visit did not go well. Putin said the move was a counter to Britain’s decision to provide more depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine. Belarus has pinned the move as being a response to Nato aggression on its borders. Zelenskiy extended an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit Ukraine. “We are ready to see him here. I want to speak with him. I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have,” he said. The Chinese leader invited Vladimir Putin to visit Beijing this year during a meeting in Moscow earlier this month. Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. He added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country.

Spain will send six Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine after the Easter holiday, the Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles said. Spain will repair another four tanks that will be sent “in the near future”, she added. Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts. French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland, the Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyber weapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages. Sweden’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Russia’s Stockholm ambassador to complain about a statement on the Russian embassy’s website that said joining Nato made the Nordic nation a “legitimate target”. Poland has urged the EU to limit the amount of Ukrainian grain entering the bloc’s market, its prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said, amid anger among farmers over the effect of imports on Polish grain prices. Ukraine’s sports ministry has condemned what it said was a partial change of position by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in international competitions as neutrals. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, described the IOC’s decision as “shameful”. Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest news from the Russia-Ukraine war. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. Poland has urged the EU to limit the amount of Ukrainian grain entering the bloc’s market, its prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said, amid anger among farmers over the effect of imports on Polish grain prices. Morawiecki said he had agreed with the leaders of several countries bordering Ukraine to write to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to demand action. Morawiecki, at a news conference, said: We demand the use of all regulatory instruments - quotas, tariffs, which will limit or block the import of Ukrainian grain into Poland. Ukraine, one of the world’s largest grain exporters, has been forced to find alternative shipping routes through Poland and Romania, after its Black Sea ports were blocked following Russia’s invasion. But logistical bottlenecks have meant large quantities of Ukrainian grains, which are cheaper than those produced in the EU, have ended up in central Europen countries, Reuters reports. The influx of Ukrainian grain has damaged prices and sales of local farmers, and caused a major headache for Poland’s ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party in an election year. Here are some images we have received from the news wires of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi visiting Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been held by Russian forces for more than a year. Ukraine’s sports ministry condemned on Wednesday what it said was a partial change of position by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in international competitions as neutrals. “The ministry of youth and sports of Ukraine condemns the partial change of the position of the International Olympic Committee regarding the non-admission of Russian and Belarusian athletes,” Reuters reports the Ukrainian ministry said in a statement. “We have consistently advocated and will continue to insist that under the conditions of the unprecedented unprovoked military aggression of the Russian Federation with the support of the republic of Belarus against Ukraine, which contradicts the principles of the Olympic charter, representatives of aggressor states should not be present at international sports arenas.” Reuters is carrying a quick snap that the Danish energy agency says that the object found near the Nord Stream 2 pipeline does not pose a safety risk, and is an empty maritime smoke buoy, which is used for visual marking. Rafael Grossi, the UN’s nuclear agency chief, has told the media in Russia that the situation is not improving at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after visiting Zaporizhzhia in an occupied region of Ukraine. While on the Russian-held territory, Grossi told Russian news agencies including Tass that “Obviously, the situation is not improving, on the contrary, hostilities around this territory are intensifying. All possible measures must be taken to protect the station from any attack.” Tass reports that he was shown “objects damaged as a result of shelling by the armed forces of Ukraine”. Russian forces have occupied the plant since March 2022, forcing Ukrainian staff to continue working while under occupation. Russia has claimed that Ukraine has shelled both the station and the nearby residential area of Enerhodar. Ukraine has claimed that shelling has been by Russian forces. Grossi previously visited the site in September 2022. Spain will send six Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine after the Easter holiday, Reuters is reporting the Spanish defence minister, Margarita Robles, as saying. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s, Robles told lawmakers, adding that Spain had repaired them and would test their combat readiness before shipping them to support Ukraine’s efforts to fend off Russia’s invasion. Spain will repair another four tanks that will be sent “in the near future”, she added. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group, has said the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has “practically destroyed” the Ukrainian army but that his forces have also been “badly damaged”. In an audio message, Prigozhin said: The battle for Bakhmut today has already practically destroyed the Ukrainian army and, unfortunately, it has also badly damaged the Wagner private military company. Asked about Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s promise to defend Bakhmut to the end, CNN reported Prigozhin as saying his forces would win in “the greatest turn in this war and in all modern history”. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has condemned the International Olympic Committee’s recommendation that Russian and Belarusian athletes compete as neutrals, describing the decision as “shameful”. Speaking at a news conference, Morawiecki said Poland would build “a coalition of states to together demand that the IOC withdraw this bad and wrong decision”. Russia has stopped informing the US about its nuclear activities, including missile test launches, after Moscow suspended its participation in the New Start arms control treaty last month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said. Ryabkov, in remarks carried by Interfax news agency, said: There will be no notifications at all. All notifications, all kinds of notifications, all activities under the treaty will be suspended and will not be conducted regardless of what position the US may take. The 2010 New Start treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms treaty between the US and Russia, limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads each side can deploy. The US and Russia hold nearly 90% of the world’s nuclear warheads between them. Vladimir Putin announced last month that Russia was suspending participation in the treaty, accusing Washington of trying to inflict a “strategic defeat” on Russia in Ukraine. Ryabkov’s remarks reflect a change of course, after the Russian foreign ministry initially said it would continue notifying the US about planned test launches of its ballistic missiles. The White House on Tuesday said the US had told Russia it would cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces after Moscow’s refusal to do so. A spokesperson for the US national security council said yesterday: Under international law, the United States has the right to respond to Russia’s breaches of the New Start treaty by taking proportionate and reversible countermeasures in order to induce Russia to return to compliance with its obligations. It comes as Russia conducted drills of its strategic missile forces today, deploying mobile launchers in Siberia in a show of the country’s nuclear capability. A Siberian journalist whose news website published content that was critical of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has gone on trial charged with discrediting Moscow’s armed forces, according to a report. Mikhail Afanasyev, one of the best-known journalists in Siberia and chief editor of Novy Fokus in the Russian region of Khakassia, was arrested by security forces in April 2022. His arrest came after the website’s reporting on 11 riot police officers who allegedly refused deployment to Ukraine. He was accused of disseminating “deliberately false information” about the Russian armed forces, an offence that carries a maximum jail sentence of 10 years under a law passed last year. My colleague Andrew Roth reported on Afanasyev’s arrest last April: Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged Russians not to adopt children who she said were “stolen” from her country during the war and deported to Russia. Vereshchuk, posting to Telegram, said orphans had been “stolen in Ukraine” and allegedly given up for adoption in Russia. She said: I strongly recommend that Russian citizens do not adopt Ukrainian orphans who were illegally taken out of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. Nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children are currently considered illegally deported to Russia or Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s ministry of integration of occupied territories. Russia says it has been evacuating people voluntarily from Ukraine, and claims it has brought thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia to protect orphans and children abandoned in the conflict zone. Russia’s defence ministry said in mid-August that 3.5m people had been brought to Russia by then, including more than half a million children. According to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office, 464 children have died so far since the war began in February last year. Police have estimated that 356 are still missing. Writing on her Telegram account today, Vereshchuk added: Once again I remind all Russian so-called ‘adoptive parents’ and ‘guardians’: sooner or later you will have to answer. The international criminal court (ICC) in the Hague issued an arrest warrant earlier this month against President Vladimir Putin and his commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing them of the war crime of illegally deporting Ukrainian children. More than 220,000 Russian personnel have been killed or injured since its troops invaded Ukraine more than a year ago, Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said, citing the latest US assessment. From Sky News’ Deborah Haynes: Russia’s “confrontation with hostile states” is “going to last for a long time”, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said. My colleague Pjotr Sauer reports: Here’s more from that Associated Press interview with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, where the Ukrainian president extended an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit his country. Zelenskiy, who has not spoken to Xi since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year, said: We are ready to see him here. I want to speak with him. I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have. The Chinese leader invited Vladimir Putin to visit Beijing this year during a meeting in Moscow earlier this month. Asked if Xi would accept Zelenskiy’s invitation, or whether one had been officially extended, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters she had no information to give. She added that Beijing maintains “communication with all parties concerned, including Ukraine”. In response to Zelenskiy’s interview, the Kremlin said it was not up to Moscow to advise the Chinese leader on whether he should visit Ukraine or not. Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, has arrived the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southeastern Ukraine, a spokesperson for the International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed. The IAEA chief is visiting Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since near the beginning of the invasion, to review the situation there, the spokesperson said. They said: At the plant now. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here taking over the live blog from Martin Belam. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Russian president Vladimir Putin is an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia, despite Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Moscow. Zelenskiy suggested that Putin’s announcement shortly after Xi’s visit that he would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, closer to Nato territory, was meant to deflect from the fact that the Chinese leader’s visit did not go well. Putin said the move was a counter to Britain’s decision to provide more depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine. Belarus has pinned the move as being a response to Nato aggression on its borders. Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. He added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country. Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that on 28 March five residents of Donetsk – three in Bakhmut and two in Chasiv Yar – were injured. The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, is due to visit the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on Wednesday, with Russian media outlets reporting he has arrived. He has described the situation there as very dangerous. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, has restated that Russia intends to achieve all the aims of what it terms its “special military operation”, despite, he said, “the steadily increasing military assistance to Ukraine from the US and other western states.” Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts. French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland, the Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyber weapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages. Global commodities trader Cargill has told Russia’s agriculture ministry that it will stop exporting Russian grain from the start of the next exporting season, which begins on 1 July, the ministry said on Wednesday. Sweden’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Russia’s Stockholm ambassador to complain about a statement on the Russian embassy’s website that said joining Nato made the Nordic nation a “legitimate target”. Sweden’s admission to Nato faces challenges as Hungary has grievances about criticism it has received from the Nordic state, and bridging this gap will require significant efforts on both sides, the Hungarian government’s spokesperson tweeted on Wednesday. After months of foot-dragging Hungary’s parliament approved a bill on Monday to allow Finland to join Nato but the Swedish bill is still stranded in parliament. Hungary’s foreign minister held telephone talks with the Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, about gas and oil shipments as well as nuclear cooperation, the Hungarian minister said late on Tuesday. In a statement, Péter Szijjártó said Novak had reassured him that despite international sanctions, the Russian party would be able to do maintenance work on the Turkstream pipeline. Russia’s state-owned news agency RIA has reported that the UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi has now arrived at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since very near the beginning of the invasion. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, is reporting that there are power outages in some areas of Kyiv and also Odesa which have been caused by weather conditions, rather than enemy action. It writes: In Kyiv and the region, due to worsening weather conditions, emergency shutdowns of lights were used. Most of them are at the Vyshhorod, Kyiv-Sviatoshyn, and Vasylkiv power stations, DTEK reported. There are also stabilizing power outages in some areas of the capital and the region. In Odesa, seven settlements remain without power due to bad weather. Russia’s embassy in the US has issued a punchy statement overnight in response to what it says are “statements of a number of US administration officials on support for the creation of a special tribunal against Russia”. It writes on its official Telegram channel: Such comments are an outright profanity that has nothing to do with justice. The US continues to demonstrate a complete disregard for the norms of international law in favour of its own geopolitical interests. The outrageous and unfounded accusations of alleged aggression, crimes against humanity and other violations are nothing more than an element of the Russophobic campaign organised by Washington as part of the hybrid war unleashed against us. The US hypocritically and cynically refrains from assessing the criminal acts of the nazis who have settled in Kyiv and have been terrorising civilians for many years. Washington is silent about its own role in the incitement of the Ukrainian conflict. It continues to support [the] Zelenskiy regime through the endless supply of lethal weapons, as a result of which the civilian population continues to die, including children, and kindergartens, schools and hospitals are destroyed. How may Washington speculate on “responsibility for aggression”, when the international community has not yet recovered from the catastrophic consequences of American adventurist interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, bombing of Yugoslavia and the atrocities in Vietnam? Sweden’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Russia’s Stockholm ambassador to complain about a statement on the Russian embassy’s website that said joining Nato made the Nordic nation a “legitimate target”, Reuters reports, citing news agency TT. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, has restated that Russia intends to achieve all the aims of what it terms its “special military operation”. State-owned news agency Tass quotes him saying: Despite the steadily increasing military assistance to Ukraine from the US and other western states, all the declared goals of the special military operation will certainly be achieved. We will achieve the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, ensure the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and the security of our population. Late last year the Russian Federation claimed to annex four regions of Ukraine after organising widely derided “referendums” in the regions which they partially occupied. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, in a move not widely recognised by the international community. An IAEA spokesperson has confirmed that UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi was on his way to the plant. He said Grossi was in the Zaporizhzhia region, but declined to say where. According to Reuters, he shared a photograph of Grossi standing in body armour by an armoured UN car on the side of a road. Sweden’s admission to Nato faces challenges as Hungary has grievances about criticism it has received from the Nordic state, and bridging this gap will require significant efforts on both sides, the Hungarian government’s spokesperson tweeted on Wednesday, Reuters reports. After months of foot-dragging Hungary’s parliament approved a bill on Monday to allow Finland to join Nato but the Swedish bill is still stranded in parliament. More from that Associated Press interview with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, where Ukraine’s president was unstinting in his criticism of his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Zelenskiy said Putin was an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia. President Xi Jinping has recently attended a state visit in Moscow, and extended an invitation to Putin to visit Beijing. Zelenskiy suggested that Putin’s announcement shortly after Xi’s visit that he would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, closer to Nato territory, was meant to deflect from the fact that the Chinese leader’s visit did not go well. Putin said the move was a counter to Britain’s decision to provide more depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine. Belarus has pinned the move as being a response to Nato aggression on its borders. Despite Putin’s nuclear provocations, and some of the harsh rhetoric that has come from his allies such as Dmitry Medvedev, Zelenskiy told AP he does not believe the Russian leader is prepared to use the bomb. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, offers this news round-up of the latest developments on its official Telegram channel: In the morning, a series of explosions rang out in the temporarily occupied Melitopol in Zaporizhzhia. The lights went out in some areas of the city and settlements. During the day, the Russian army launched 34 airstrikes and artillery strikes on the de-occupied part of Kherson region, three on Kherson. It struck houses, a hospital and a post office. One person is injured. At night, the Ukrainian military destroyed a Russian Su-24M bomber in the direction of Bakhmut, the air force reported. The claims have not been independently verified. Journalists from Associated Press accompanied Volodymyr Zelenskiy on part of his trip this week around frontline regions of Ukraine, and to the border region of Sumy. During that time, Ukraine’s president reiterated requests for more modern weaponry, and also said some elements that had been supplied by the west had not worked. “We have great decisions about Patriots, but we don’t have them for real,” he said, referring to the US-made air defence system that has been promised. Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. Zelenskiy added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country. Zelenskiy also reiterated his longstanding request for fighter jets, saying: “We still don’t have anything when it comes to modern warplanes.” Poland and Slovakia have decided to give Soviet-era fighter jets to Ukraine, but no western country so far has agreed to provide modern warplanes, through concerns that it might escalate the conflict and provide Ukraine with strike capabilities deep into Russian territory, and that the length of time that it would take to train pilots and provision ground crews makes the delivery in the short-term impractical. Global commodities trader Cargill has told Russia’s agriculture ministry that it will stop exporting Russian grain from the start of the next exporting season, which begins on 1 July, the ministry said on Wednesday. “The cessation of its export activities on the Russian market will not affect the volume of domestic grain shipments abroad. The company’s grain export assets will continue to operate regardless of who manages them,” the agriculture ministry said in a comment to Reuters. A spokesperson for Cargill’s Russian unit declined to comment to the news agency. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that on 28 March five residents of Donetsk – three in Bakhmut and two in Chasiv Yar – were injured due to the war. Hungary’s foreign minister held telephone talks with the Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, about gas and oil shipments as well as nuclear cooperation, the Hungarian minister said late on Tuesday. In a statement, Péter Szijjártó said Novak had reassured him that despite international sanctions, the Russian party would be able to do maintenance work on the Turkstream pipeline. “Thus Hungary’s gas supply will continue without any disruptions,” the statement added. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan. My colleague Martin Belam will take you through the rest of the day’s news. Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts. French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland, the Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyber weapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages. Microsoft said in a threat assessment earlier this month that Russian actors had launched attacks in at least 17 European countries in the first six weeks of this year. Thales and Microsoft said Russia’s invasion was accompanied by widespread cyberattacks in Ukraine, but they were repelled. Both firms said Russia shifted focus to other European countries late last year. “In the third quarter of 2022, Europe was dragged into a high-intensity hybrid cyberwar at a turning point in the conflict,” said Pierre-Yves Jolivet, Thales vice president for cyber solutions. Jolivet said countries outside Ukraine were suffering a “massive wave” of DDoS attacks, when a server is flooded with requests that crash the network. These attacks were increasingly carried out by “hacktivist” groups aligned with the Kremlin rather than official groups, and they aimed to sow chaos rather than destroy infrastructure, Thales said. Poland, Latvia and Sweden were among the most affected countries, the Thales report said. Microsoft said in its assessment that attacks this year in Europe were largely aimed at government entities for espionage purposes. Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Russia’s state TASS news agency, citing Moscow-installed officials in the area, said Ukrainian shelling had damaged the city’s power supply system and knocked out electricity in the city and some nearby villages. TASS also reported that a locomotive depot was destroyed but according to initial information, there were no casualties. The Guardian has not verified these reports independently. The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, is visiting the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine today. He has described the situation there as very dangerous. He said in an interview with Reuters that his work on forging an agreement to protect Europe’s largest nuclear power station was still alive. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the site. The nuclear facility has lost its external power supply six times since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago, forcing emergency diesel generators to kick in to cool its reactors. Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the water level in a nearby reservoir controlled by Russian forces was another potential danger. Water supplied by the reservoir is used to cool the reactors. He told Reuters yesterday: If the reservoir level goes down beyond a certain level, then you don’t have water to cool down the reactors, and we have seen especially in January that the levels of the water were going down significantly. They recovered somehow in the past few weeks. He added that there had been increasing military activity in the region without giving details. Grossi said his attempt to broker a deal to protect the plant was still alive, and that he was adjusting the proposals to seek a breakthrough. Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand of troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday, in what is likely to be seen as another attempt by Moscow to show off its nuclear strength, Reuters reports. President Vladimir Putin has aimed to make the Yars missile system, which replaced the Topol system, part of Russia’s “invincible weapons” and the mainstay of the ground-based component of its nuclear arsenal. “In total, more than 3,000 military personnel and about 300 pieces of equipment are involved in the exercises,” the defence ministry said in a statement on Telegram. The drills involve the Strategic Missile Forces comprehensive control checking of the Omsk missile formation together with a command and staff exercise with the Novosibirsk missile formation equipped with the Yars systems. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said in an interview that he he worries the war could be affected by shifting political forces in Washington. In an interview with AP, published a short while ago, Zelenskiy said: “The United States really understands that if they stop helping us, we will not win”. Following its long interview with Ukraine’s leader, AP reports: Zelenskiy is well aware that his country’s success has been in great part due to waves of international military support, particularly from the United States and western Europe. But some in the United States – including Republican Donald Trump, the former American president and current 2024 candidate – have questioned whether Washington should continue to supply Ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid. Trump’s likely Republican rival, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, also suggested that defending Ukraine in a ‘territorial dispute’ with Russia was not a significant US national security priority. He later walked that statement back after facing criticism from other corners of the GOP. Zelenskiy didn’t mention the names of Trump or any other Republican politicians – figures he might have to deal with if they prevailed in 2024 elections. Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan bringing you the latest. Our top story this morning: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says that he he worries the war could be impacted by shifting political forces in Washington. In an interview with AP, published a short while ago, Zelenskiy said: “The United States really understands that if they stop helping us, we will not win”. And Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday, in what is likely to be seen as another attempt by Moscow to show off its nuclear strength. We’ll have more on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments. The United States has not seen any indications that Vladimir Putin is getting closer to using tactical nuclear weapons in his war on Ukraine, after the Russian leader said he was moving such weapons into Belarus. Belarus confirmed it would host Russian tactical nuclear weapons, saying the decision was a response to years of western pressure. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Belarus would face further EU sanctions. Russia said it shot down a US-supplied GLSDB guided smart bomb fired by Ukrainian forces, the first time Moscow has claimed to have intercepted one of the weapons that could double Ukraine’s battlefield firing range. Ukraine’s frontline city of Avdiivka “is being wiped off the face of the Earth” amid intensifying Russian shelling, according to its top local official. Russian forces have been making recent gradual gains on the flanks of Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian military said last week that the city could become a “second Bakhmut”. Russia’s 10th tank regiment has borne the brunt of the assault of Avdiivka and has likely lost a “large portion of its tanks” while attempting to surround the town from the south, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. Ukraine is aiming to exhaust and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to capture the small eastern city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces has said. In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. Germany’s much-awaited shipment of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks has arrived in Ukraine, the German defence ministry has confirmed. Berlin first promised 14 but increased that to 18 as part of a deal under which several EU states would contribute to a shipment of two Leopard 2 battalions and 31 American-made M1A2 Abrams tanks from the US. The first British Challenger 2 main battle tanks have also arrived in Ukraine and will soon begin combat missions, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said. The UK said in January it would send 14 of the tanks to Ukraine. Reznikov wrote on Twitter that the tanks had “recently arrived in our country” and posted a video that showed him sitting in one of a long line of tanks in an open field, all of them flying Ukraine’s yellow and blue flag. The US supports the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression against Ukraine, officials have said. The US ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice, Beth Van Schaak said the court might also be located elsewhere in Europe, at least at first, in order “to reinforce Ukraine’s desired European orientation”. A Russian man who was investigated by police after his 12-year-old daughter drew a picture depicting Russian bombing a family in Ukraine has been sentenced to two years in a penal colony, according to a rights group. Alexei Moskalyov has been separated from his daughter Maria since he was placed under house arrest, and she was taken into a state-run shelter last month. Court officials said on Tuesday that the 54-year-old had fled house arrest and his whereabouts were unknown. The International Olympic Committee has recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in international sporting events under a neutral flag. A decision regarding next year’s Olympics in Paris and the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in 2026 would be taken “at the appropriate time”, it said. Germany’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said the committee’s decision was “a slap in the face for all Ukrainian athletes”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jan/30/australia-and-france-agree-arms-deal-for-ukraine-as-talks-seek-to-bury-aukus-debacle","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-30T17:20:45Z","webTitle":"Australia and France agree arms deal for Ukraine as talks seek to bury Aukus debacle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/30/australia-and-france-agree-arms-deal-for-ukraine-as-talks-seek-to-bury-aukus-debacle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jan/30/australia-and-france-agree-arms-deal-for-ukraine-as-talks-seek-to-bury-aukus-debacle","fields":{"headline":"Australia and France agree arms deal for Ukraine as talks seek to bury Aukus debacle","bodyText":"Australia and France have agreed a deal to jointly manufacture and supply thousands of artillery shells to the Ukrainian army, the defence and foreign ministers of the two countries announced on Monday. The agreement, “worth several million (Australian) dollars”, was announced after bilateral talks in Paris aimed at resetting the relationship between the two countries seriously damaged by the 2021 Aukus affair. A first shipment of 155mm shells from existing stocks is expected to be delivered to Kyiv within the next two months. The ministers refused to give further details of the contract that will see Australia and France jointly manufacture the ammunition that can be used by French, American and German artillery supplied to Ukraine. Australian deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, said the signed agreement was the opening of “new cooperation between the Australian and French defence industries.”. “We wanted to act together as a statement of how importantly Australia and France regard support of Ukraine in the current conflict. We wanted to make it really clear that Australia and France stand together in support of Ukraine in the face of the aggression from Russia,” Marles added. Marles and the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, met their counterparts Sébastien Lecornu and Catherine Colonna for what is known as a “2+2” meeting, the first since the 2021 diplomatic rupture sparked by Aukus. France was furious after Canberra dumped a $90bn deal for French submarines in favour of a deal with the US and UK. Angry French officials, including the French president Emmanuel Macron, accused the government of Scott Morrison of “betrayal”. At a press conference after the talks in Paris on Monday, the key – and repeated – words were “warmth” and “friendship” between the two countries. In an opening salvo, Colonna said the talks were the first of their format since 2021 adding drily: “I will not go back over that.” She said the aim of the meeting was to forge a partnership based on “mutual respect, confidence and common values”. Asked if the two countries trying to publicly paper over the cracks in their relationship publicly, she replied: “It’s not communication. It’s politics”. Marles said the aim of the talks was to “grow and deepen the relationship between our two defence forces and said the two countries had agreed to greater access to their respective defence facilities in the Indo-Pacific region. Asked whether delays in the Aukus programme meant Australia would be asking France to supply “interim” submarines, Marles said no. “We are obviously working closely with the US and the UK to develop a nulcear power submarine capability.

Video footage posted on social media showed a large waterside area on fire, with a column of black smoke rising from the burning fuel. Other images showed a huge pall of smoke hanging over the area. The fire was later extinguished, according to Moscow-installed governor Mikhail Razvozhaev. The death toll from Russia’s aerial attacks on cities across Ukraine early on Friday has risen to at least 25, including five children. Firefighters tackled a blaze at a residential apartment hit by a Russian missile in the central town of Uman and rescue workers clambered through a huge pile of smouldering rubble searching for survivors. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has said it is necessary to ensure Russia’s invasion of Ukraine does not succeed and that Seoul is considering its options when it comes to providing lethal aid to Kyiv. Yoon said the Russian invasion was a violation of international law and the rights of Ukrainians. There is a realistic possibility the Russian missile strike that struck Ukraine on Friday was an attempt to intercept Ukrainian reserve units and military supplies that were recently given to the country, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said on Saturday. In its intelligence update on the conflict, the MoD said Moscow launched “the first major wave of cruise missile strikes against Ukraine since early March 2023.” The bombardment killed at least 25 people, and were a departure from Russia’s use of long-range strikes that targeted energy infrastructure over winter, the MoD said. Russia says it will lodge an official diplomatic protest over what it says is the illegal seizure by the Polish authorities of its embassy school in Warsaw. Moscow’s ambassador to Poland, Sergei Andreyev, told Russian state news agencies on Saturday that the move was illegal, but Poland said it was within its rights to take back the building. Ukraine’s president said on Friday that he had asked his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to help bring back Ukrainian children deported by Russia. More than 16,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the invasion, according to Kyiv. Russian occupying authorities in southern Ukraine said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were subjecting the city of Novaya Kakhovka to “intense artillery fire” that had cut off electricity. The city’s authorities said on Telegram: “Novaya Kakhovka and settlements around the district are under very intense artillery fire from the armed forces of Ukraine.” Novaya Kakhovka is in the part of the southern Kherson region that Russia controls. A Moscow court has fined a Russian baker who decorated her cakes with pro-Ukraine and peace slogans. Since Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine in February 2022, authorities have banned all public criticism of the offensive. The Izmailovo district court in Moscow ordered the baker Anastasia Chernysheva to pay a fine of 35,000 rubles (around £350) for “discrediting” the Russian army. Russia’s embassy in Ireland has warned of possible “ensuing consequences” over tributes paid to an Irishman killed while fighting in Ukraine. Finbar Cafferkey, from Achill Island in Co Mayo, is reported to have been killed while serving as a military volunteer in eastern Ukraine, PA Media reports. In the wake of his death, the Irish deputy premier, Micheál Martin, expressed his sympathies to Cafferkey’s family and said he had obviously been “a young man of clear principles”. In response, the Russian embassy issued a stark warning against encouraging Irish citizens to take part in the conflict in Ukraine. Five EU countries have agreed on a deal to allow the transit of Ukrainian food exports, the European Commission said, after temporary bans were imposed on the foodstuffs amid protests by farmers. The agreement with Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia comes as limits on Ukraine grain’s export channel via the Black Sea necessitate export overland via the country’s neighbours. A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas. The report last August prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts. Ukraine’s forces are concluding preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive againstRussian troops and are broadly ready, the country’s defence minister has said. Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for the start of the counteroffensive, intended to repel Russian forces from the east and south, but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready.” Vladimir Putin has said Russia needs to act quickly and as a “cohesive team” to counter the west’s “economic aggression”, adding that Moscow would expand ties with countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. A Ukrainian journalist who formerly worked for the BBC has been killed fighting on the frontline. Oleksandr Bondarenko volunteered for Ukraine’s territorial defence after Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and later became part of the military. Details of how he was killed in action are not yet known, BBC News reports. Bondarenko, known as Sasha or Sashko, worked at the BBC’s Ukrainian service from 2007 to 2011, broadcasting from Kyiv. His colleagues paid tribute to the “extraordinary” reporter and news presenter. A Russian navy vessel specialising in submarine operations was photographed near the sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines just days before the mysterious blasts last September, according to the Danish daily newspaper Information. The prosecutor leading Sweden’s investigation into the sabotage of the pipelines linking Russia to Germany confirmed the existence of the previously publicly unknown photographs. The UK has signed a £1.9bn ($2.4bn) deal with Poland to provide the country with a British-designed air defence system. About 22 Polish air defence batteries will be equipped with common anti-air modular missiles (Camms) and launchers as part of the arrangement. It expands on pre-existing defence ties with Poland, where Camms are already deployed with the British army following Russia’s invasion. Russia informed the UN’s nuclear watchdog that equipment spotted at Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would be used to fix a power transmission line that leads to Russian-held territory, the watchdog said on Friday. The planned restoration of the downed power line could heighten Ukrainian fears that Russia is preparing to connect Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, to the power grid of territory that it controls. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree giving people living in parts of Ukraine that are under Moscow’s control a route to Russian citizenship – but it also means that those who decline it, or do not legalise their status, potentially face deportation. The decree – which covers Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – sets out ways that Ukrainian citizens living there can start the process of becoming Russian citizens or legalise their status. Spain’s foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador over a video shared on the embassy’s social media accounts that falsely portrayed Spanish troops fighting in Ukraine. Spanish media said the video, which has now been taken down, showed what the embassy claimed were Spanish soldiers on the battlefield, set against a clip of Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, saying Spanish troops would never fight in Ukraine. Around 190,000 Russian soldiers have died since the conflict began, according to Ukraine’s ministry of defence. A court in Russia has convicted a woman over social media posts condemning the war in Ukraine and punished her with a steep fine despite her asking for a prison sentence. Marina Novikova, a 65-year-old lawyer, was found guilty of “spreading false information” about the Russian army, which was made a criminal offence after Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine. Novikova’s posts on the messaging app Telegram decried the invasion and criticised the Russian government, Sky News reported. Prosecutors had requested a three-year prison sentence and Novikova pleaded with the court to send her to prison rather than be issued with a fine of at least 700,000 roubles (£6,900). But the court in Seversk instead imposed a fine of one million roubles (nearly £10,000), the Russian human rights and legal aid group OVD-Info quoted her husband, Alexandr Gavrik, as saying. The fire at a fuel storage facility in the Crimean port of Sevastopol has been extinguished, the city’s Moscow-installed governor said on Saturday. Experts examined the site and “it became clear that only one drone was able to reach the oil reservoir”, Mikhail Razvozhaev said on the Telegram messaging app, adding that no one had been injured in the fire which was caused by a drone strike. Another drone was downed, its wreckage found on the shore near the terminal, Razvozhaev added, Reuters reports. A Ukrainian military intelligence official said more than 10 tanks of oil products with a capacity of about 40,000 tonnes intended for use by Russia’s Black Sea Fleet were destroyed, RBC Ukraine reported. The official, Andriy Yusov, did not claim Ukraine was responsible for the explosion in comments reported by RBC, instead describing the blast as “God’s punishment” for a Russian strike on a Ukrainian city on Friday. “This punishment will be long-lasting. In the near future, it is better for all residents of temporarily occupied Crimea not to be near military facilities and facilities that provide for the aggressor’s army,” RBC quoted Yusov as saying. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s armed forces said earlier he did not have any information to suggest Ukraine was responsible for the fire. Here is what you might have missed: A huge fire that was burning in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol on Saturday has been put out after what was reported to be a Ukrainian drone strike on fuel tanks at a Russian navy depot.

With Reuters and Agence France-Presse The American political commentator Noam Chomsky has said Russia is fighting with more restraint in Ukraine than the US and its allies did during the invasion of Iraq. In an interview with the New Statesman released on Saturday, the celebrated linguist said the destruction seen in Iraq’s capital has not been witnessed in the current conflict. He said: Undoubtedly Russia could do it, presumably with conventional weapons. It could make Kyiv as unliveable as Baghdad was, could move in to attacking supply lines in western Ukraine. Chomsky also said Britain and the US had refused peace negotiations in Ukraine, and that Washington was only supplying weapons to Kyiv in order to weaken Russia. For the US, this is a bargain. For a fraction of the colossal military budget, the US is able to severely degrade the military forces of its only real military adversary. Chomsky was challenged on his views on Ukraine in a combative interview with Times Radio host Matt Chorley earlier this week. Russia’s embassy in Ireland has warned of possible “ensuing consequences” over tributes paid to an Irishman killed while fighting in Ukraine. Finbar Cafferkey, from Achill Island in Co Mayo, is reported to have been killed while serving as a military volunteer in eastern Ukraine, PA Media reports.

In response, the Russian embassy issued a stark warning against encouraging Irish citizens to take part in the conflict in Ukraine. In a statement posted to its Telegram channel, the embassy said it noted Martin’s comments about Cafferkey’s “clear principles”. It said: We do not know what his principles were. What we do know, though, is that in a very big way it is the Irish government and media to who bear responsibility for the death of Finbar Cafferkey. It has been the government and media who have been promoting anti-Russian propaganda, distorting the truth about the conflict in Ukraine, misleading people like Finbar Cafferkey. Commenting on Twitter, the former justice minister Charlie Flanagan said: Threatening, intimidating &amp; chilling statement by Russian embassy Dublin. These hostile remarks are unacceptable. Beyond time Ambassador Filatov &amp; his crew were asked to leave our country. A Moscow court has fined a Russian baker who decorated her cakes with pro-Ukraine and peace slogans, Agence France-Presse reports.

On Friday, the Izmailovo district court in Moscow ordered the baker Anastasia Chernysheva to pay a fine of 35,000 rubles (around £350) for “discrediting” the Russian army, a court representative told the news agency. Chernysheva, who runs a baking business, has been posting pictures of colourful cakes bearing slogans in opposition to armed conflict on Instagram, where she is followed by more than 25,000 people. She was briefly detained on Thursday after an ultra-conservative media outlet drew attention to her work in January. Other cakes, decorated with hearts and flowers, referenced pop culture or read “Love will win” or “I love you!”. Pope Francis met Ukrainians who had fled the war on Hungary’s eastern border on Saturday, telling the refugees that a different future is possible. Reuters reports: Francis met with about 600 refugees, poor and homeless people in a visit to St. Elizabeth’s church in Budapest on the second day of his visit, which began on Friday when he pointedly warned of the dangers of rising nationalism in Europe. Francis was serenaded by a singing band of Hungarian Roma wearing flower-patterned clothing and seemed to enjoy the music as they hovered around him as he sat in his wheelchair. But what Francis heard earlier was much more sober. Oleg Yakovlev told of he and his wife Lyudmila and their five children had to leave Dnipro a year ago after Russian bombings. “We were welcomed here and we have found a new home (but) many have suffered and suffer still because of the war,” Yakovlev told the pope. Sitting in the first row of the church with his family, the youngest of Yakovlev children, a boy of about four, was amused by the attention he was getting, making faces at reporters as his father spoke of missiles, crumbled buildings and a 1,500km trip to safety. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, 2022, millions of refugees have fled through Central Europe, including Hungary, and moved to other countries. About 35,000 have applied for temporary protection status in Hungary. Francis said expressing compassion for those suffering from poverty and tragedy is an integral part of being a Christian, even if those in need are non-believers. “Even amid pain and suffering, once we have received the balm of love, we find the courage needed to keep moving forward: we find the strength to believe that all is not lost, and that a different future is possible,” he said. Later the pontiff met with Metropolitan (bishop) Hilarion, representative of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) in Budapest. Hilarion was effectively ousted from the number two post at the ROC headquarters in Moscow last year, a decision seen as indicating discord at the top of the Russian Patriarchate over the war. The Russian Orthodox Church is by far the biggest of the churches in the Eastern Orthodox communion, which split with Western Christianity in the Great Schism of 1054. The Russian invasion of Ukraine divided world Orthodoxy and strained relations between the Vatican and the ROC. ROC Patriarch, Kirill, is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kirill fully backs the war as a bulwark against a West he describes as decadent. The European Union tried to put Kirill on its sanctions list last year but member states failed to find unanimity on the issue as Hungary opposed his inclusion. Relations between the Vatican and the ROC have been frosty since Francis said last year that Kirill should not be “Putin’s altar boy”. Russian occupying authorities in southern Ukraine said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were subjecting the city of Novaya Kakhovka to “intense artillery fire” that had cut off electricity. AFP reports that the city’s authorities said on Telegram: “Novaya Kakhovka and settlements around the district are under very intense artillery fire from the armed forces of Ukraine.” Novaya Kakhovka is in the part of the southern Kherson region that Russia controls. It lies upstream on the Dnipro River from Kherson, the regional capital from which Russia withdrew last November. Novaya Kakhovka fell to Russian forces on the first day of their invasion. When a Northumberland couple opened up their village home to a Ukrainian mother and her two daughters last year, they were responding to the plight of refugees escaping the Russian invasion. Having been told no more than that this was a musical family, Sheilagh Matheson and Chris Roberts offered two bedrooms and a honky-tonk piano. Soon they found themselves arranging the loan of a Steinway upright after discovering that these children had an extraordinary musical talent – one that made passersby stop to listen at an open window. Both girls have now received scholarships to two of the UK’s foremost music schools, less than a year after fleeing their home near Kyiv to start new lives in Corbridge, not far from Newcastle. The BBC’s Ukraine correspondent, Myroslava Petsa, reports comments from Ukraine’s Defence Intelligence (GUR) that 10 tanks of petrol were destroyed in the blaze at the Sevastopol fuel depot on Saturday. A spokesperson said the fire was “God’s punishment” against Russia for the missile strikes against Ukraine on Friday that killed at least 25 people. Russia says it will lodge an official diplomatic protest over what it says is the illegal seizure by the Polish authorities of its embassy school in Warsaw. Moscow’s ambassador to Poland, Sergei Andreyev, told Russian state news agencies on Saturday that the move was illegal, but Poland said it was within its rights to take back the building. Reuters reports that Andreyev told the TASS news agency: Today the Polish authorities decided to take forceful action, despite the fact that this is a diplomatic building, a school building. This is an illegal action and a violation of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. We of course will lodge a protest. The Polish state-run news channel TVP Info reported that police were present outside the school on Kieleckiej street in Warsaw on Saturday morning. The two countries’ already fraught relations have soured further over the war in Ukraine with Warsaw helping to arm Kyiv. A fire at a fuel storage facility in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol has been extinguished, the Moscow-installed governor has said. Reuters reports that Mikhail Razvozhaev said on Telegram: Open fire was extinguished in an area of 1,000 square metres. He said earlier that no one had been injured and according to preliminary information that the depot was hit by two drones. Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-appointed head of Crimea, said on Telegram that air defence and electronic warfare forces had shot down two drones over the Crimea on Saturday. He confirmed there were no casualties Russian and blamed the attacks on Ukraine. A spokesperson for Ukraine‘s armed forces said he did not have any information to suggest Ukraine was responsible for Saturday’s fire. Here is what you might have missed: A huge fire was burning in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol on Saturday after what was reported to be a Ukrainian drone strike on fuel tanks at a Russian navy depot. Video footage posted on social media showed a large waterside area on fire, with a column of black smoke rising from the burning fuel. Other images showed a huge pall of smoke hanging over the area.

With Reuters and Agence France-Presse Drone footage shows the aftermath of the airstrike in Ukraine on early Friday morning that left 23 people dead and dozens more injured. The upper floor of a residential building in the central city of Uman, south of Kyiv, was struck as people slept. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, condemned the latest “evil” Russian assault in his evening address on Friday. Ukraine‘s foreign ministry said on Saturday that it had passed notes to Polish and EU representatives describing the limits their countries had placed on Ukrainian grain imports as “categorically unacceptable”. Reuters reports that the ministry said: Such restrictions, whatever the justification for them, do not comply with the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU and the principles and norms of the EU single market. There are full legal grounds for the immediate resumption of exports of Ukrainian agricultural goods to Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria, as well as the continuation of unhindered exports to other EU member states. It comes a day after the European Commission said on it had reached a deal in principle to allow the transit of Ukrainian grain to resume through Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. “It was an incredible, emotional moment for me to spend time with her,” Andriy Shevchenko says as he describes meeting a little Ukrainian girl called Maryna last month. The most famous former footballer from Ukraine, who won the Ballon d’Or in 2004 and the Champions League with Milan before he also coached his country at Euro 2020, pauses as he reflects on a simple encounter where he kicked a football back and forth in hospital with the six-year-old. The images of their kickaround assume a grainy resonance when it is explained that Maryna had become the first child in Ukraine to receive a prosthetic limb after her leg was blown off by a Russian missile last year. For many weeks she barely moved. Finally, when she was well enough to sit up, her doctors started the slow process of her rehabilitation by using a football. Maryna learned to balance on her prosthetic leg while using her good foot to kick the ball. Ukraine’s president said on Friday that he had asked his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to help bring back Ukrainian children deported by Russia. In his evening address, AFP reports that Volodymyr Zelenskiy as saying: We need to involve everyone ... to put pressure on the Russian aggressor and the terrorists who kidnapped so many of our children. The UN, many others want to do something, but so far the results have been poor. So I have appealed to the leader of China. Xi and Zelensky spoke by phone on Wednesday, the first known call between the two leaders since the start of Russia’s invasion. Beijing says it is neutral in the conflict and Xi has never condemned the invasion. More than 16,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the invasion, according to Kyiv. It says many of them have been placed in institutions and foster homes, an allegation denied by Russia, which insists it saved Ukrainian children from the horrors of the war. Russia’s private Wagner militia, which is leading the assault on Bakhmut in Ukraine and has been active in Africa, could soon cease to exist, its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin said in video remarks to a blogger that were released on Friday evening. It was not immediately clear when Prigozhin had spoken and how serious he was being. He said earlier in the week he had been joking when he said his forces would stop shelling Bakhmut to allow Ukrainian forces to show the city to journalists. Reuters reports that he told Russian war blogger Semyon Pegov: Now, with regard to the need in general for shells at the front, what we want. Today we are coming to the point where Wagner is ending. Wagner, in a short period of time, will cease to exist. We will become history, nothing to worry about, things like this happen. Pegov posted the clip on his Telegram channel. Wagner did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They have popped up like mushrooms after rain,” says Maria Glazunova, who works at the Dovzhenko Centre, Kyiv’s film archive. “They are lovely places where you can drink coffee, read, and just sniff the books.” After the terrifying early months of 2022, and a brutal winter of drone attacks and blackouts, a crop of new independent bookshops is hardly what one would expect to find in the Ukrainian capital. But, in defiance of Russia’s ongoing invasion, they are springing up all around Kyiv.

In its intelligence update on the conflict, the MoD said Moscow launched “the first major wave of cruise missile strikes against Ukraine since early March 2023.” The bombardment killed at least 25 people, and were a departure from Russia’s use of long-range strikes that targeted energy infrastructure over winter, the MoD said. The update added: There is a realistic possibility that Russia was attempting to intercept Ukrainian reserve units and military supplies recently provided to Ukraine. Russia operates an inefficient targeting process and prioritises perceived military necessity over preventing collateral damage, including civilian deaths. Video footage of the oil terminal on fire in Russian-occupied Crimea. Footage apparently taken from the scene shows large flames at the scene and thick smoke billowing into the sky, amid claims of a drone attack. Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev said on his Telegram channel that 18 fire brigades were tackling the blaze on Saturday morning. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has said it is necessary to ensure Russia’s invasion of Ukraine does not succeed and that Seoul is considering its options when it comes to providing lethal aid to Kyiv. Reuters reports that Yoon said the Russian invasion was a violation of international law and the rights of Ukrainians. We should prove that such attempts will never reach success, to block further attempts being made in the future. Yoon made the comments in a speech at Harvard University’s Kennedy School on the fifth day of a state visit to mark the 70th anniversary of the US-South Korean alliance. Yoon was asked about the possibility of South Korea providing lethal aid to Ukraine and replied: We are closely monitoring the situation that’s going on the battlefield in Ukraine and will take proper measures in order to uphold the international norms and international law. Right now we are closely monitoring the situation and we are considering various options. Joe Biden is considering visiting new Nato member Finland to coincide with the military alliance’s July summit in Lithuania, NBC News has reported, citing three US officials familiar with the discussions. The US network said the White House’s discussions of a potential visit by the US president had been ongoing for several months and remained active, according to the officials, who said no final decision had been made. Any Finland visit would be for a summit of multiple Nordic countries, not for a bilateral visit, an administration official said. The death toll from Russia’s aerial attacks on cities across Ukraine early on Friday has risen to at least 25, including five children. Reuters reports that firefighters tackled a blaze at a residential apartment hit by a Russian missile in the central town of Uman and rescue workers clambered through a huge pile of smouldering rubble, searching for survivors and bodies as anxious people stood by. “My neighbours are gone. No one is left,” said Serhii Lubivskyi, 58, who survived inside a flat on the seventh floor. He was rescued by firefighters from the balcony where he escaped with his wife after the explosion blocked their front door. Officials said at least 23 civilians were killed, including four children, with an estimated 109 people living in the part of the block that was hit and 27 flats completely destroyed. Lubivskyi wept as he looked up at the smouldering gaps in the building where adjacent flats had been blasted away. An elderly woman, her daughter and two grandchildren lived on the ninth floor. They are gone. A man with his son lived on the eighth floor. They are gone. A woman with her daughter lived on the seventh floor. They are gone. A young family lived on the sixth floor, their son was lucky ... he is alive. In the south-eastern city of Dnipro, a missile killed a two-year-old child and a 31-year-old woman, said the regional governor, Serhiy Lysak. Video released by the authorities showed a blackened hole where a missile had crashed through an apartment window. Moscow claimed it had targeted locations of Ukrainian reserve troops and had struck them successfully, preventing them from reaching the front. It supplied no evidence to support this. A fuel tank was ablaze in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol in what appeared to be a drone strike, the governor said on Saturday. Reuters reports that the Moscow-installed governor, Mikhail Razvozhaev, wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “According to preliminary information, the fire was caused by a drone hit.” Sevastopol, on the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, has come under repeated air attacks since Russia’s full-fledged invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. Russian officials have blamed the attacks on Ukraine. The Ukrainian military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. Kyiv almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia or on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Razvozhaev said no one was hurt in Saturday’s fire. The situation is under the control of our firefighters and all operative services. Since the volume of fuel is large, it will take time to localise the fire. Hello and welcome back to our coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine. This is Adam Fulton with the latest developments to bring you up to speed. A fuel tank was on fire in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol in what appeared to be a drone strike, the Moscow-installed governor said on Saturday. “According to preliminary information, the fire was caused by a drone hit,” Mikhail Razvozhaev wrote on Telegram. Meanwhile, five children are among the dead as the toll from Russia’s wave of missile attacks on cities across Ukraine rose to 25. Rescue workers were searching for survivors and bodies amid the smouldering rubble of a nine-storey block of flats hit in Uman, central Ukraine. The barrage of more than 20 missiles early on Friday is Russia’s first large-scale air strike in almost two months. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, described Uman as “absolutely peaceful” and condemned the attacks, saying: “Only absolute evil can unleash such terror against Ukraine.” He added: “Our air force managed to shoot down most of the Russian missiles – 21 out of 23. If not for this, the terrorist state would have managed to claim many more casualties, more lives.” More on those stories shortly. In other news: Five EU countries have agreed on a deal to allow the transit of Ukrainian food exports, the European Commission has said, after temporary bans were imposed on the foodstuffs amid protests by farmers. The agreement with Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia comes as limits on Ukraine grain’s export channel via the Black Sea necessitate export overland via the country’s neighbours. A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas. The report last August prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts. Ukraine’s forces are concluding their preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive against invading Russian troops and are ready, broadly speaking, the country’s defence minister has said. Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for the start of the counteroffensive, aimed at repelling Russian forces from the east and south, but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready.” President Vladimir Putin has said Russia needs to act quickly and as a “cohesive team” to counter the west’s “economic aggression”, adding that Moscow would expand ties with countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. A Ukrainian journalist, who formerly worked for the BBC, has been killed fighting on the frontline. Oleksandr Bondarenko volunteered for Ukraine’s territorial defence after Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and later became part of the military. Details of how he was killed in action are not yet known, BBC News reports. Bondarenko, known as Sasha or Sashko, worked from 2007 to 2011 at the BBC’s Ukrainian service, broadcasting from Kyiv. His colleagues paid tribute to the “extraordinary” reporter and news presenter. A Russian navy vessel specialising in submarine operations was photographed near the sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines just days before the mysterious blasts last September, according to the Danish daily newspaper Information. The prosecutor leading Sweden’s investigation into the sabotage of the pipelines linking Russia to Germany confirmed the existence of the previously publicly unknown photographs. The UK has signed a £1.9bn ($2.4bn) deal with Poland to provide the country with a British-designed air defence system. About 22 Polish air defence batteries will be equipped with common anti-air modular missiles (Camms) and launchers as part of the arrangement. It expands on pre-existing defence ties with Poland, where Camms are already deployed with the British army following Russia’s invasion. Russia informed the UN’s nuclear watchdog that equipment spotted at Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would be used to fix a power transmission line that leads to Russian-held territory, the watchdog said on Friday. The planned restoration of the downed power line could heighten Ukrainian fears that Russia is preparing to connect Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, to the power grid of territory that it controls. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree giving people living in parts of Ukraine that are under Moscow’s control a route to Russian citizenship – but it also means that those who decline it, or do not legalise their status, potentially face deportation. The decree – which covers Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – sets out ways that Ukrainian citizens living there can start the process of becoming Russian citizens or legalise their status. Spain’s foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador over a video shared on the embassy’s social media accounts that falsely portrayed Spanish troops fighting in Ukraine. Spanish media said the video, which has now been taken down, showed what the embassy claimed were Spanish soldiers on the battlefield, set against a clip of Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, saying Spanish troops would never fight in Ukraine.

A major announcement 18 months in the making is expected when the UK prime minister meets his Australian counterpart, Anthony Albanese, and US president Joe Biden. In response to concerns about Beijing’s economic coercion and foreign policy aims, the UK’s defence and security strategy for the 2020s is being updated, and the revised version is due to be published on Monday. It will address “increasingly concerning behaviour” by Chinese president Xi Jinping’s government, the “grave risks” posed by Russia after a renewed assault on Ukraine and “hybrid threats” to Britain’s economy and energy security, No 10 said. Before his trip to California, Sunak hailed “global alliances” – such as the one formed between the UK, US and Australia in September 2021 – as “our greatest source of strength and security”. He added: “I am travelling to the US today to launch the next stage of the Aukus nuclear submarine programme, a project which is binding ties to our closest allies and delivering security, new technology and economic advantage at home.” The UK would be “secure, prosperous and standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our partners”, thanks to the programme and the updated Integrated Review, Sunak said. He will hold meetings on Sunday night and Monday, before flying back home before the budget on Wednesday. The visit threatened to cast a shadow over Sunak’s trip on Friday to Paris, given the French government reacted with consternation to its own submarine deal with Australia being scrapped a year and a half ago. Britain is stepping up efforts to increase its influence in the Indo-Pacific, and Sunak hopes the trilateral summit on Monday will demonstrate his commitment to standing up to China, which senior Conservative MPs have urged him to take a tougher stance on. The Guardian revealed earlier this week that Sunak had expressed delight to fellow ministers about the outcome of negotiations, with multiple sources saying they believed the eight nuclear-powered submarines would be based on British designs. Such a move would safeguard the long-term future of the shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness, since the full fleet may not be seaworthy until the 2040s. Reports this week suggested that the short-term gap could be plugged by Australia buying up to five Virginia-class submarines from the US. Under the three-way deal the US and UK will agree to share secret reactor technology. Australia will become the seventh country to have a nuclear-powered submarine, relying on an enriched uranium reactor – putting its diesel-powered navy on a technological par with China. But it will require Australia, which is not a nuclear power, to be supplied with a reactor, a move that Beijing has argued is a breach of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. The three Aukus powers say that is not the case, and that any reactors will be supplied “welded, shielded and sealed shut”, according to Australian officials overseeing the effort. Charles Edel, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies thinktank, has described the Aukus pact as a calculated gamble. “It’s a bet that by further integrating industrial capacities and increasing interoperability it will significantly augment the capabilities of our allies, make them more powerful, and ultimately change Beijing’s calculations about its security environment,” he said. “And that by doing so, it will help stabilise a region that has been badly destabilised by China’s rapid expansion of military capabilities and increasingly aggressive foreign policy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/06/turkey-earthquake-syria-what-we-know-so-far","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-06T18:46:29Z","webTitle":"Syria and Turkey earthquake: what we know so far","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/06/turkey-earthquake-syria-what-we-know-so-far","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/06/turkey-earthquake-syria-what-we-know-so-far","fields":{"headline":"Syria and Turkey earthquake: what we know so far","bodyText":"At least 2,600 people have been killed after two powerful earthquakes struck Turkey and Syria within the space of 12 hours. The death toll is expected to rise, with search and rescue operations under way across the region as many buildings have collapsed and there are thought to be many people trapped in the rubble. Official figures from Turkey said 1,651 people were killed in 10 provinces, with another 11,119 injured, according to the country’s health minister. The death toll in government-held areas of Syria rose to 968 people, with 1,280 injured, according to data from the Damascus government and rescue workers in the north-western region controlled by insurgents. More than 10 search-and-rescue teams from the European Union had been mobilised since the earthquake, a spokesperson for the European Commission said. The US, UK, Canada, Israel, Russia and China were among other nations to have offered assistance, and calls have emerged for the international community to relax some of the political restrictions on aid entering north-west Syria, the country’s last rebel-held enclave and one of the areas worst hit by the earthquake. The first quake struck as people slept, and measured magnitude 7.8, one of the most powerful quakes in the region in at least a century. It was felt as far away as Cyprus and Cairo. The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said preliminary data showed the second large quake measured 7.7 magnitude, and was 42 miles (67km) north-east of Kahramanmaraş, Turkey, at a depth of 2,000 metres. There have been more than 100 smaller aftershocks registered by seismologists. The partial destruction of a Roman-era castle in the Turkish city of Gaziantep, near where the first quake had its epicentre, led to fears that the earthquakes may have damaged other priceless monuments in Turkey and Syria, areas rich in cultural heritage. Turkey’s armed forces set up an air corridor to enable search-and-rescue teams to reach the zone affected. Turkey’s Akkuyu nuclear power plant, which is under construction, was not damaged by the earthquake, an official from the Russian company building the plant said. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has called for increased funding for humanitarian aid in Syria, saying that many people in the north-west of the country have already been displaced up to 20 times, and that medical care in the region was “strained beyond capacity, even before this tragedy”. The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was concerned about areas in Turkey from which there had been no news since the earthquake. In 1999, a tremor of similar magnitude to today’s quakes in Turkey devastated İzmit, killing more than 17,000. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has described Monday as the worst disaster for the country since 1939, when an earthquake killed more than 32,000 people and injured more than 100,000. There were no reports of British deaths in the earthquakes that hit Turkey and Syria, said the UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, acknowledging the relief effort was still at an early stage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/jan/27/china-owns-vast-offshore-network-uk-real-estate-records-reveal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-27T14:45:53Z","webTitle":"China owns vast network of UK real estate, offshore records reveal ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/27/china-owns-vast-offshore-network-uk-real-estate-records-reveal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jan/27/china-owns-vast-offshore-network-uk-real-estate-records-reveal","fields":{"headline":"China owns vast network of UK real estate, offshore records reveal ","bodyText":"The Chinese government owns a vast network of UK real estate via offshore secrecy jurisdictions such as Luxembourg and the Isle of Man, the Guardian can reveal, raising questions about Beijing’s grip on links in the UK supply chain. Disclosures made as part of a new government register of property owned via offshore entities show that China’s investment division owns more than 250 properties across Britain via dozens of companies. They include distribution centres that are key to the flow of food and goods in multiple regions of the UK including the south-west and south-east of England and the Midlands. The properties are all ultimately owned via the China Investment Corporation (CIC), which manages the foreign exchange reserves of the People’s Republic of China and is estimated to have more than £970bn of assets. Land Registry records suggest that CIC has spent at least £580m on UK properties, although the true figure is likely to be significantly higher because some records are incomplete. While CIC was known to be an investor in UK property, the scale and detail of its purchases has remained hidden until now due to the use of a vast array of offshore companies. The register, which brought the details to light, indicates that CIC has focused on distribution depots, retail parks and trading estates, including some that are critical to regional infrastructure. Chinese investment in the UK has been a source of concern and division within the government. Some MPs welcome the flow of cash into Britain, while others have raised security concerns about the role played by China and Chinese companies in strategic assets. In 2020, the government ordered that the telecoms company Huawei be removed from Britain’s 5G mobile phone infrastructure before 2027, a decision that Beijing described as “groundless”. The government also went cold on plans for China General Nuclear to be involved in the building of a new nuclear power plant, buying CGN out of its stake in the planned Sizewell C project. The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said it was concerning that so much of the investment was “disguised” via offshore companies. He drew comparisons with the attempted takeover of the UK tech company Newport Wafer Fab, which initially appeared to be the target of a Dutch company before its ultimate Chinese ownership was revealed. The government eventually blocked the deal on security grounds. “You sometimes have to go back several links to discover who actually owns the company,” said Duncan Smith, who chairs the international Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China. “If they can buy that much, all sounding like important parts of the supply chain, it begs the question of why they’re doing this. This makes the case that we now need to have a strategic audit of the total amount of Chinese finance inside UK key areas, including universities, technology and supply chains. We’re way too open to the interests of Chinese companies.” CIC and the Chinese embassy did not return requests for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/02/afternoon-update-tony-armstrong-calls-out-racist-abuse-lions-escape-sydney-enclosure-netanyahu-ahead-in-israel-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-02T06:18:11Z","webTitle":"Afternoon Update: Tony Armstrong calls out racist abuse; lions escape Sydney enclosure; Netanyahu ahead in Israel poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/02/afternoon-update-tony-armstrong-calls-out-racist-abuse-lions-escape-sydney-enclosure-netanyahu-ahead-in-israel-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/02/afternoon-update-tony-armstrong-calls-out-racist-abuse-lions-escape-sydney-enclosure-netanyahu-ahead-in-israel-poll","fields":{"headline":"Afternoon Update: Tony Armstrong calls out racist abuse; lions escape Sydney enclosure; Netanyahu ahead in Israel poll","bodyText":"Good afternoon.

Here’s where we stand: Ukrainian forces have had “successes” in three areas of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson, according to a Ukrainian regional official. Yuriy Sobolevskyi, the deputy head of Kherson’s regional council, said Ukrainian troops had enjoyed successes in the Kherson, Beryslav, and Kakhovka districts, without providing details. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed, however, that Ukraine’s attempts to mount a counter-offensive in the south of the country had failed. In its daily briefing, it said Ukraine’s forces had suffered heavy losses in equipment and men. It has not been possible to independently verify either side’s claims. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of firing on a town near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog were en route to inspect the facility. One of the shells hit the building where Energodar’s city council is located, according to its mayor Dmytro Orlov. The alleged Russian attack on Energodar occurred hours after a team led by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, set off from Kyiv to visit the Russian-held power plant. The team arrived in the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia, 55km (34 miles) away from the plant, on Wednesday afternoon. IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, said his agency will seek to establish a permanent presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to avoid “a nuclear accident” at the facility. He added that the agency’s visit to the plant will last a few days. Russian-installed officials in the area near the power station previously suggested the visit might last only one day. Russia has the potential to open up a “second theatre of war” should it choose to do so, Germany’s chief of defence has warned. Russia is “very well capable of expanding the conflict regionally” and will not run out of ammunition any time soon, according to Gen Eberhard Zorn, the highest-ranking soldier of the Bundeswehr. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said “heavy fighting” continues in “almost the entire territory” of Kherson. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, Natalia Humeniuk, said Ukraine’s forces had succeeded in damaging bridges that join Kherson across the river, rendering them “impassable for heavy machinery”. Ukraine continues its offensive against Russia’s forces across southern Ukraine, pushing the frontline back “some distance in places”, according to British intelligence. Russia will likely now attempt to plug the gaps in its line using pre-designated mobile reserve units, the latest update by the UK Ministry of Defence said. Russia has stopped the flow of gas via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Europe, in a move that has heightened already acute nervousness over the reliability of winter energy supplies. The halt on the Baltic Sea pipeline at 5am on Wednesday would last for three days, Gazprom, the Russian state energy company said, citing the need to carry out repairs. EU foreign ministers have agreed to fully suspend a visa facilitation agreement with Russia. The move will mean that Russian citizens applying for EU visas will find it more costly and time-consuming. Today’s announcement stops short of a blanket ban of travel visas for Russians which eastern EU states and the Nordic countries were calling for. The move to restrict travel visas for Russians is a step “in the right direction”, Finland’s foreign minister Pekka Haavisto said. Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have said they are considering barring Russian travellers from entry if the EU fails to do so. The move should contain exceptions “for dissidents as well as other humanitarian cases”, the four countries – which all border Russia – said in a joint statement published before the EU’s visa deal suspension announcement. The funeral of the Soviet Union’s last leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who died on Tuesday aged 91, will take place in Moscow on Saturday, Russian news agencies reported, citing Gorbachev’s daughter and his foundation. The ceremony will be held on 3 September in the Moscow Hall of Columns, the same place where Joseph Stalin’s body was put on display following his death in 1953, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Gorbachev’s daughter Irina. Vladimir Putin has sent official condolences to the family of Mikhail Gorbachev as the Kremlin broke its silence over the death of the last leader of the Soviet Union. But it has demurred on whether Gorbachev will receive a state funeral or be dealt a final snub by a successor who tore down his legacy. Germany’s economy ministry has asked the country’s domestic intelligence agency to investigate two senior ministry officials over allegations of spying for Russia. German intelligence services opened an inquiry after senior economy ministry staff shared their concerns when the two civil servants showed “sympathy for the Russian view” on questions of energy policy, according to Die Zeit. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thanks for reading. I’ll be back tomorrow. The Biden administration is expected to announce additional security aid for Ukraine shortly, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby. Kirby said at a news briefing: We ... committed more than $13 billion of security assistance to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and we will continue to do that. And there will be announcements of future security assistance in the coming days. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said his agency will seek to establish a permanent presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to avoid “a nuclear accident” at the facility. The 14-strong team from the UN nuclear watchdog is expected to arrive at the Russian-held nuclear plant in southern Ukraine on Thursday. Speaking to reporters, Grossi said: My mission is... to prevent a nuclear accident and preserve the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. The “real work” begins tomorrow, he said, adding that he was going to “try to establish a permanent presence for the agency” at the nuclear plant. A delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency has arrived in the city of Zaporizhzhia, from where they plan to travel to Russian-controlled territory to inspect Europe’s biggest power plant. Recent bombardment in the area has led to fears of a catastrophe, with Ukraine and Russia trading blame for the attacks. “My mission is a technical mission. It is a mission that seeks to prevent nuclear accident,” says Rafael Grossi, the IAEA chief. He added that the plant was a Ukrainian facility despite being currently occupied by Russian forces. The funeral of the Soviet Union’s last leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who died on Tuesday aged 91, will take place in Moscow on Saturday, Russian news agencies reported, citing Gorbachev’s daughter and his foundation. The ceremony will be held on 3 September in the Moscow Hall of Columns, the same place where Joseph Stalin’s body was put on display following his death in 1953, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Gorbachev’s daughter Irina. The same day, Gorbachev will be buried at Moscow’s central Novodevichy cemetery, Russian state-owned news agency Tass cited Vladimir Polyakov, press secretary for the Gorbachev Foundation, as saying. A source close to the Gorbachev family had earlier told Tass that he would be buried next to his wife Raisa, who died in 1999. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said earlier that the Kremlin would decide on Wednesday whether Gorbachev would be given a state funeral, and whether President Vladimir Putin would be in attendance. The EU’s move to restrict travel visas for Russians is a step “in the right direction”, Finland’s foreign minister Pekka Haavisto said. Finland and other members of the European bloc that share a land border with Russia, including the Baltic states and Poland, have been calling for an EU-wide tourist visa ban for Russians. Speaking to reporters following the EU’s announcement, Haavisto said: This goes in the right direction but once again we saw that so far there has been a lot of talk and little action. He added: When Russia is invading Ukraine and we receive refugees from Ukraine and try to help Ukraine in every way, this is not a time for holidaymaking and luxury tourism (for Russians). Germany’s economy ministry has asked the country’s domestic intelligence agency to investigate two senior ministry officials over allegations of spying for Russia, Die Zeit has reported. German intelligence services opened an inquiry after senior economy ministry staff shared their concerns, according to the weekly. The two civil servants drew the attention of colleagues by showing “sympathy for the Russian view” on questions of energy policy, including on the decision to block the approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, it said. The pair are said to have an “emotional proximity to Russia”, according to the report, though as yet authorities had no “hard evidence” of spying or corruption. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukrainian forces have had “successes” in three areas of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson, according to a Ukrainian regional official. Yuriy Sobolevskyi, the deputy head of Kherson’s regional council, said Ukrainian troops had enjoyed successes in the Kherson, Beryslav, and Kakhovka districts, without providing details. Russia’s defence ministry claimed, however, that Ukraine’s attempts to mount a counter-offensive in the south of the country had failed. In its daily briefing, it said Ukraine’s forces had suffered heavy losses in equipment and men. It has not been possible to independently verify either side’s claims. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of firing on a town near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog were en route to inspect the facility. One of the shells hit the building where Energodar’s city council is located, according to its mayor Dmytro Orlov. The alleged Russian attack on Energodar occurred hours after a team led by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, set off from Kyiv to visit the Russian-held power plant. The team arrived in the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia, 55km (34 miles) away from the plant, on Wednesday afternoon. IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, said the mission’s visit to the nuclear plant was a “technical mission” that aimed to prevent a nuclear accident. He added that the agency’s visit to the plant will last a few days. Russian-installed officials in the area near the power station previously suggested the visit might last only one day. Russia has the potential to open up a “second theatre of war” should it choose to do so, Germany’s chief of defence has warned. Russia is “very well capable of expanding the conflict regionally” and will not run out of ammunition any time soon, according to Gen Eberhard Zorn, the highest-ranking soldier of the Bundeswehr. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said “heavy fighting” continues in “almost the entire territory” of Kherson. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, Natalia Humeniuk, said Ukraine’s forces had succeeded in damaging bridges that join Kherson across the river, rendering them “impassable for heavy machinery”. Ukraine continues its offensive against Russia’s forces across southern Ukraine, pushing the frontline back “some distance in places”, according to British intelligence. Russia will likely now attempt to plug the gaps in its line using pre-designated mobile reserve units, the latest update by the UK Ministry of Defence said. Russia has stopped the flow of gas via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Europe, in a move that has heightened already acute nervousness over the reliability of winter energy supplies. The halt on the Baltic Sea pipeline at 5am on Wednesday would last for three days, Gazprom, the Russian state energy company said, citing the need to carry out repairs. EU foreign ministers have agreed to fully suspend a visa facilitation agreement with Russia. The move will mean that Russian citizens applying for EU visas will find it more costly and time-consuming. Today’s announcement stops short of a blanket ban of travel visas for Russians which eastern EU states and the Nordic countries were calling for. Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have said they are considering barring Russian travellers from entry if the EU fails to do so. The move should contain exceptions “for dissidents as well as other humanitarian cases”, the four countries – which all border Russia – said in a joint statement published before the EU’s visa deal suspension announcement. Vladimir Putin has sent official condolences to the family of Mikhail Gorbachev as the Kremlin broke its silence over the death of the last leader of the Soviet Union. But it has demurred on whether Gorbachev will receive a state funeral or be dealt a final snub by a successor who tore down his legacy. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you with all the latest developments from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Russia has the potential to open up a “second theatre of war” should it choose to do so and should not be underestimated, Germany’s chief of defence has warned. Gen Eberhard Zorn, the highest-ranking soldier of the Bundeswehr, told Reuters in an interview: The bulk of the Russian land forces may be tied down in Ukraine at the moment but, even so, we should not underestimate the Russian land forces’ potential to open a second theatre of war. Russia also has a navy and air force at its disposal as well as substantial reserves, he added. He said: Most of the Russian navy has not yet been deployed in the war on Ukraine, and the Russian air force still has significant potential as well, which poses a threat to Nato too. Russia is “very well capable of expanding the conflict regionally”, he said. The dynamic of Russia’s attack had slowed down but Moscow’s forces were “supported by massive artillery fire” and still pressing steadily ahead, “regardless of civilian Ukrainian casualties”, Gen Zorn said. He also suggested Russia was not about to run out of ammunition any time soon, adding: The Russians have enormous quantities of ammunition at their disposal. This ammunition is partly old and very inaccurate but it is exactly this that causes great destruction to civilian infrastructure. They fire around 40,000 to 60,000 rounds of artillery ammunition per day. EU foreign ministers agreed on Wednesday to fully suspend a visa facilitation agreement with Russia, making it harder and more costly for Russian citizens to enter the bloc, reports Reuters. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borell told a news conference in Prague: We agreed on … full suspension of the European Union-Russia visa facilitation agreement. This will significantly reduce the number of new visas issued by the EU member states. It’s going to be more difficult, it’s going to take longer. The suspending of the visa facilitation agreement means that Russian citizens applying for EU visas will find it more costly and time-consuming. Today’s announcement stops short of a blanket ban of travel visas for Russians that eastern EU states and the Nordic countries were calling for. However, an agreement on an outright ban could not be reached after Germany and France warned their peers that such a move would be counter-productive. Some eastern states have said they will press ahead with a visa ban themselves if there is no EU agreement. More than 1 million Russian citizens have entered the bloc through land border crossing points since the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, most of them via Finland and Estonia, the bloc’s border agency Frontex said. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said today that the agency’s first planned visit to Ukraine‘s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant will last a few days. Russian-installed officials in the area near the power station previously suggested the visit might last only one day, Reuters reports. Grossi told reporters at a hotel in Zaporizhzhia: The mission will take a few days. If we are able to establish a permanent presence, or a continued presence, then it’s going to be prolonged. But this first segment is going to take a few days. We have a very important task there to perform – to assess the real situation there, to help stabilise the situation as much as we can. He added that the IAEA team had guarantees from both Russia and Ukraine enabling it to enter the war zone. Politicians from around the world paid have tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, who has died aged 91. “Gorbachev is one of those people who changed the world, and unquestionably changed it for the better,” said the British prime minister, Boris Johnson. Similar sentiment was expressed from leaders across the globe. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, highlighted Gorbachev’s role in overcoming division in Europe, while the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, called him a “courageous reformer”. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of firing on a town near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog were en route to inspect the facility. Evhen Yevtushenko, head of Nikopol district military administration, said the Russian army was shelling Energodar, adding: These provocations are dangerous. One of the shells hit the building where Energodar’s city council is located, according to its mayor Dmytro Orlov. He posted pictures of a damaged high-rise with a hole punched into the side and debris littering the ground. The attack occurred hours after a team led by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, set off from Kyiv to visit the Russian-held power plant. The team have arrived in the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia, 55km (34 miles) away from the plant. Grossi said the mission’s visit to the nuclear plant was a “technical mission” that aimed to prevent a nuclear accident. Sweden will donate artillery ammunition worth around 500m krona (£40m) to Ukraine, the Swedish government has said. The announcement comes after Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called on Sweden to provide Ukraine with Archer artillery systems, RBS-70 air-defence systems, and more artillery shells. The “best thing Sweden can do in the field of defence” in the coming weeks is to provide Ukraine with more weapons, Kuleba said in a joint press conference on Monday with Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, and foreign minister, Ann Linde. He added: As strange as it may sound, the best way to save human lives, including the lives of civilians, and to save more Ukrainian villages and towns from destruction, is to give Ukraine more weapons so that we can repel Russian aggression and the Russian army. Kuleba also thanked Sweden for allocating a new aid package to Ukraine, which will be divided into reconstruction and defence aid. Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have said they are considering barring Russian travellers from entry if the European Union as a whole fails to do so. In a joint statement obtained by AFP, the four countries, which all border Russia, said the suspension of a 2007 visa facilitation agreement between the EU and Russia was “a necessary first step”. The move, proposed by the presidency and backed by many EU members, would make EU visas more costly for Russian travellers and lift a deadline on visa issuance times. The statement added: But we need (to) drastically limit the number of visas issued, above all tourist visas, to decrease the flow of Russian citizens into the European Union and the Schengen area. The move should contain exceptions “for dissidents as well as other humanitarian cases”, they said. Until such measures are in place on the EU level, we … will consider introducing on the national level temporary measures of visa ban, or restricting border crossing for Russian citizens holding EU visas. Speaking to reporters in Prague, Estonia’s foreign minister, Urmas Reinsalu, called for a “ban of entry of Russian Federation citizens into the European Union”. He added: Timing is crucial and the loss of time is paid by the blood of Ukrainians. Meanwhile, Hungary’s foreign minister Peter Szijjarto announced on Facebook that the EU will suspend the 2007 visa facilitation agreement. There will not be a blanket visa ban imposed as there is no unanimity on that, he added. A delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has arrived in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia ahead of a visit to a Russian-held nuclear power plant. A convoy brought in the 14-strong team, led by the head of the IAEA Rafael Grossi, which had left Kyiv in the morning. The city is normally about a two-hour drive from the plant but it is unclear how or when the team will reach the site given the complexities of crossing into Russian-held areas. Before heading off with his team to Zaporizhzhia this morning, Grossi told reporters they planned to spend “a few days” at the plant and would report back afterwards. A delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency has left Kyiv for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, in a region of Ukraine occupied by Russia, for an inspection after bombardment in the area led to fears of a catastrophe. The IAEA mission, comprising representatives from countries deemed neutral by both sides, will inspect the plant and lend technical assistance. The visit was reportedly intended to last four days. But the Russian-occupying authorities said on Wednesday that the IAEA will be given access for one day. They also said that the mission will be expected to join the queue of civilians who cross back and forth to the occupied territories. If this happens, it could delay or disrupt the visit. These potential obstacles come in addition to safety concerns. Ukraine and Russia have given their security guarantees for the mission to travel to the plant and the neighbouring areas, Rafael Grossi, the head of the agency, said before leaving Kyiv. The plant and the surrounding towns continue to come under shelling. Last week, fighting in and around Europe’s largest nuclear plant damaged vital electricity supplies prompting global concern. Grossi described the mission as “very complex”. “We are going to a war zone,” he said. Read the full article here. Grain silos in Ukraine’s second biggest port, Mykolaiv, caught fire after they were struck by Russian shelling of the city, Ukraine’s emergency service has said. In a statement on Facebook, Ukraine’s emergency service said: As a result of the shelling of Mykolaiv, grain silos at an infrastructure facility in the Korabelny district caught fire. Firefighting continues. It published photos showing holes in the metal roofs of at least two silos and fire brigades pouring water on damaged facilities. Russian military units are reportedly locking conscripts in hot rooms without water until they agree to sign up to fight in Ukraine, Russian media has reported. Russian outlet Ridus has reported that a local military recruitment centre in the Tver region has received complaints that conscripts are being coerced through psychological pressure into signing military contracts. The outlet cited the mother of a conscript in the Tver region as saying: Guys in this military unit, on the orders of the political officer, are gathered in the club in enormous heat and with the windows closed. They don’t let them leave and they don’t let them drink water. It has not been possible to independently verify this information. Such pressure tactics, if true, highlight some of the difficulties the Russian army has faced as a result of the Kremlin’s political decision not to formally declare war on Ukraine – preferring instead to describe the invasion as a “special military operation”. Under Russian military rules, only contract soldiers can be sent to the frontline. Ukrainian forces have had “successes” in three areas of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson, according to a Ukrainian regional official. Yuriy Sobolevskyi, the deputy head of Kherson’s regional council, said Ukrainian troops had enjoyed successes in the Kherson, Beryslav, and Kakhovka districts. Sobolevskyi did not provide any details about the alleged success of the Ukrainian troops, but his comments came as Russia’s defence ministry claimed that Ukraine’s attempts to mount a counter-offensive in the south of the country had failed. In its daily briefing, the Russian defence ministry said Ukraine’s forces had suffered heavy losses in equipment and men. It also said its forces had shot down three Ukrainian helicopters and that Ukraine had lost four fighter jets during two days of fighting around the Mykolaiv-Kriviy Rih frontline and in other areas of southern Ukraine. It has not been possible to independently verify either side’s claims. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you again today with all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. It is just after 1pm in Ukraine. Here is what you might have missed: A team of nuclear experts are en route by car to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant amid international concern of a potential accident or radiation leak. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) envoy set off from Kyiv this morning to the plant in south-eastern Ukraine, a Reuters witness reported from the scene. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi told a briefing in Kyiv as reported by Ukrainian media outlet Ukrinform: “We are finally leaving after six months of effort. The IAEA is heading to the Zaporizhzhya NPP. As you know, we have a very important task there – to work and examine the real situation there, to help stabilise the situation as much as possible.” However, the UN nuclear inspectors who set off on Wednesday morning from Kyiv might not visit the facility until Thursday. A Reuters reporter travelling in a convoy with the team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it was likely the inspectors would stay overnight in the nearby city of Zaporizhzhia before visiting the plant, which is on territory controlled by Russia, on Thursday. Ukraine has accused Russia of deliberately shelling corridors to make it unsafe for the IAEA inspectors to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the south of the country. A key adviser to Ukraine’s president Mykhailo Podolyak said Russia was attempting to force the mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. Ukraine’s counteroffensive to retake Kherson will be a “slow operation to grind the enemy”, the senior presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych has said. “Of course, many would like a large-scale offensive with news about the capture by our military of a settlement in an hour,” he wrote. “But we don’t fight like that … Funds are limited.” Russia has halted gas supplies via a major pipeline to Europe, citing a need for maintenance on its only remaining compressor and raising the prospects of recession and energy rationing throughout the region. The outage for maintenance on Nord Stream 1 means that no gas will flow to Germany between 1am GMT on Wednesday and 1am GMT on Saturday 3 September, according to Russian state energy giant Gazprom. Data from the Nord Stream 1 operator’s website, as cited by Reuters, showed flows at zero for 4-5am Central European Time (2-3am GMT) on Wednesday. European governments fear Moscow could extend the outage in retaliation for western sanctions imposed. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said “heavy fighting” continues in “almost the entire territory” of Kherson. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, Natalia Humeniuk, said Ukraine’s forces had succeeded in damaging bridges that join Kherson across the river, rendering them “impassable for heavy machinery”. The UN’s cultural agency has said it supports a bid by Ukraine to put its port city of Odesa on the Unesco world heritage list of protected sites. The historic centre of Odesa has already been struck by artillery fire and is located only a few dozen kilometres from the frontline, the agency said in a statement. Ukraine continues its offensive against Russia’s forces across southern Ukraine, pushing the frontline back “some distance in places”, according to British intelligence. The full report released by the UK Ministry of Defence added that Russia “continues to expedite attempts to generate new reinforcements for Ukraine.” Boris Johnson has paid tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev, describing him as a man “who changed the world and unquestionably changed it for the better”. Johnson added the Kremlin is “intent on undoing the good” of Gorbachev and attempting to “recreate that Soviet empire” with its war in Ukraine, PA Media reports. The former leader of the Soviet Union died on Tuesday night at the age of 91. A Moscow-installed leader of occupied Kherson has reportedly fled to Russia. When asked by the Guardian about his location, Kirill Stremousov said he was “travelling around Russian cities, meeting different people for work”. The previous head of Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, welcomed Ukraine’s counterattacks in Kherson, saying it is a key moment in the war. Sir Alex Younger told the BBC that the fightback from Kyiv showed the two opposing forces had “reached some kind of balance, which is an unexpected and frankly welcome situation”. Ukraine is using wooden decoys of advanced US rocket systems to trick Russia into wasting its missiles on them, according to the Washington Post. The decoy versions of US-supplied rocket launcher systems drew at least 10 Russian Kalibr cruise missiles, leading Ukraine to further boost its production of replicas, in an effort to lure Moscow into firing its expensive long-range missiles on fake targets, the publication said. The last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, has died in Moscow aged 91. Gorbachev’s reforms led to the unlooked-for break-up of his own country, and to the demise of communism across central and eastern Europe. He died after a “difficult and protracted illness”, Russian news agencies cited hospital officials as saying on Tuesday. Recent reports suggested he was had a kidney ailment. Ukraine’s parliament endorsed several laws and ratifications on Tuesday to bring the country closer to the European Union, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. “We are moving step by step towards full membership in the EU,” he added. Zelenskiy met with the UN nuclear watchdog chief who will lead an expert team to inspect the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine this week. “It’s an important mission, and we’re doing everything we can for it to be safe and work at full capacity,” he said during a meeting with the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, on Tuesday. The head of the Russian-installed local administration, Yevgeny Balitsky, said he did not expect much from the IAEA visit and told the Interfax news agency the inspectors “must see the work of the station in one day”. At least five people were killed and 12 wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv, Zelenskiy said. “Only one Russian shelling of Kharkiv took the lives of five people today, another 12 were wounded.” The wholesale price of gas has dropped sharply in a rare respite from recent highs on signs that Europe is preparing to intervene directly in energy markets. The European Commission said it was working “flat out” on an emergency package, and on a longer-term “structural reform of the electricity market” to combat soaring prices while efforts to fill gas storage facilities appear to be ahead of schedule. The day-ahead UK wholesale gas price tumbled by more than 20% to 447p per therm on Tuesday, while the month-ahead contract dropped by a quarter, to 473p per therm. Vladimir Putin said in a condolence telegram sent today that Mikhail Gorbachev had a “huge impact on the course of world history”. Putin said the former Soviet leader, who died aged 91, “led our country through a period of difficult, dramatic change and substantial foreign policy, economic, and social challenges”. The Russian president said that Gorbachev “deeply understood that reforms were necessary” and strove to offer his own solutions to the problems faced by the Soviet Union in the 1980s, reports Reuters. UN nuclear inspectors who set off for Ukraine‘s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant this morning from Kyiv might not visit the facility until Thursday. A Reuters reporter travelling in a convoy with the team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it was likely the inspectors would stay overnight in the nearby city of Zaporizhzhia before visiting the plant, which is on territory controlled by Russia, on Thursday. There is confusion about how long the inspection will last after Russian-installed officials in the area suggested the visit might last only one day. While the IAEA and Ukrainian officials suggested it could last several days. There are widespread reports of an oil depot fire taking place in a village near the town of Dzhankoy, in Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. Authorities have not yet commented on the videos of the blaze that are being shared on social media. Mykhailo Podolyak, a key adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said today that Russian forces are becoming “more active in the occupied territories”. In a post on Twitter, he alleged they are robbing businesses, farmers and dismantling factories. The latest pictures from the newswires show the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) setting off today from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv towards the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Conservative leadership hopeful Rishi Sunak said the legacy of Mikhail Gorbachev will be “remembered by us all” and that he helped “bring peace to Europe”. Boris Johnson has paid tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev, describing him as a man “who changed the world and unquestionably changed it for the better”. Johnson added the Kremlin is “intent on undoing the good” of Gorbachev and attempting to “recreate that Soviet empire” with its war in Ukraine, PA Media reports. The former leader of the Soviet Union died on Tuesday night at the age of 91. Speaking outside a police station in Lewisham, south-east London, the prime minister said: Mikhail Gorbachev is one of those people who changed the world and unquestionably changed it for the better. When you look at what he did to make Europe whole, free, to give freedom to the countries of the former Soviet Union – it was quite an extraordinary thing. And of course, Mikhail Gorbachev is one of those people who triggered a change, a series of changes, that perhaps he didn’t anticipate. Maybe he paid his own political price for it but when history is written, he will be, I think, one of the authors of fantastic change for the better in the world. And what I worry about today is that the current leadership in Moscow is intent on undoing the good of Mikhail Gorbachev, and is intent on a revanchist attempt, a revenge-driven attempt, to recreate that Soviet empire, and you’re seeing that in Ukraine - that’s the tragedy, something that Mikhail Gorbachev would have thought was absolutely unthinkable, unwarranted. Ukraine‘s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the European Union to ban Russian tourists, describing the measure as appropriate since a majority of Russians supported the country’s “genocidal war of aggression” against Kyiv. Kuleba told Reuters as EU foreign ministers were set to meet in Prague on Wednesday for talks: The time for half-measures is gone. Only a tough and consistent policy can produce results. The ministers are expected to agree on suspending a visa facilitation agreement with Moscow, meaning that Russians will have to wait longer, and pay more, for visas, while the bloc is likely to stay split over an outright EU travel ban. In a statement emailed to Reuters, Kuleba said: A visa ban for Russian tourists and some other categories will be an appropriate response to Russia’s genocidal war of aggression in the heart of Europe supported by an overwhelming majority of Russian citizens. He also proposed launching a special programme for Russian soldiers who do not want to fight in Ukraine. (The message): save yourself and leave. Lay down arms, surrender to Ukrainian forces, and get an opportunity to start a new life. I am confident that this offer is worth making, because even if one Russian soldier lays down arms and decides to leave, it means saved Ukrainian lives and closer peace. Ukraine continues its offensive against Russia’s forces across southern Ukraine, pushing the frontline back “some distance in places”, according to British intelligence. The full report released by the UK Ministry of Defence this morning reads: Ukrainian armoured forces have continued to assault Russia’s Southern Grouping of Forces on several axes across the south of the country since Monday. Ukrainian formations have pushed the front line back some distance in places, exploiting relatively thinly held Russian defences. In line with its doctrine, Russia will likely now attempt to plug the gaps in its line using pre-designated mobile reserve units. These will likely include some of those from the Eastern Grouping of Forces. Russia continues to expedite attempts to generate new reinforcements for Ukraine. Volunteer battalions of the new 3rd Army Corps had departed their home base near Moscow by 24 August, highly likely for onward deployment to Ukraine. The operational effectiveness of these units is not known. The 3rd Army Corps is highly likely short of personnel and these troops have had limited training.” The UN’s cultural agency has said it supports a bid by Ukraine to put its port city of Odesa on the Unesco world heritage list of protected sites. The historic centre of Odesa has already been struck by artillery fire and is located only a few dozen kilometres from the frontline, the agency said in a statement. The statement followed a meeting of the agency’s director, Audrey Azoulay, and Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, in Paris. The agency added: On 24 July 2022, part of the large glass roof and windows of Odesa’s Museum of Fine Arts, inaugurated in 1899, were destroyed. It said it had mobilised experts to support Ukraine so that the nomination can be examined urgently by World Heritage Committee member states. The UN agency also said it wants to add Odesa, Kyiv and Lviv to the list of world heritage sites “in danger”. Russia has halted gas supplies via a major pipeline to Europe, citing a need for maintenance on its only remaining compressor and raising the prospects of recession and energy rationing throughout the region. The outage for maintenance on Nord Stream 1 means that no gas will flow to Germany between 1am GMT on Wednesday and 1am GMT on Saturday 3 September, according to Russian state energy giant Gazprom. Data from the Nord Stream 1 operator’s website, as cited by Reuters, showed flows at zero for 4-5am Central European Time (2-3am GMT) on Wednesday. European governments fear Moscow could extend the outage in retaliation for western sanctions imposed. Further restrictions to European gas supplies would heighten an energy crunch that has already sent wholesale gas prices soaring over 400% since last August. The upcoming work was announced less than two weeks in advance and is being carried out by Gazprom not Nord Stream AG, focusing on the last operating turbine at the station. Moscow blames maintenance issues and sanctions it says prevent the return and installation of equipment. Gazprom said the latest shutdown is needed to perform maintenance on the pipeline’s only remaining compressor. Ukraine has accused Russia of deliberately shelling corridors to make it unsafe for the IAEA inspectors to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the south of the country. A key adviser to Ukraine’s president Mykhailo Podolyak said Russia was attempting to force the mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. Another senior presidential adviser Andriy Yermak said Russia aimed to force the UN team through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. “Russia is trying to disrupt the visit of the IAEA mission to the nuclear power plant by simulating combat operations in Energodar and shelling the area near the nuclear power plant,” he said. Zelenskiy also claimed Russia “does not stop provocations precisely in those directions from which the mission is supposed to arrive at the station”. The occupiers have not abandoned the plant, they are continuing bombardments and are not withdrawing arms and ammunition from the site. They are intimidating our personnel. The risk of a nuclear catastrophe due to Russian actions is not diminishing for even an hour”, he added. “An immediate and total demilitarisation in Zaporizhzhia is necessary”. Zelenskiy met with the UN nuclear watchdog chief who will lead an expert team to inspect the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine this week. Director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, arrived in the Ukrainian capital late on Monday at the head of a 14-strong team before a visit to the Russian-occupied plant. Zelenskiy said the mission was “probably one of the top-priority questions regarding the safety of Ukraine and the world today”, and called for the “immediate de-militarisation of the plant” and its transfer to “full Ukrainian control”. The Ukrainian president said he hoped the delegation would “find an opportunity, thanks to our special services, thanks to the security corridors, to get to the station and do the best to avoid all those threats on a global scale”. He also urged the mission to do more than inspect the plant, saying that strategic decisions were required “regarding the urgent demilitarisation of the station, the withdrawal of all, any, military personnel of the Russian Federation with explosives, with any kind of weapon”. A team of nuclear experts are en route by car to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant amid international concern of a potential accident or radiation leak. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) envoy set off from Kyiv this morning to the plant in southeastern Ukraine, a Reuters witness reported from the scene. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi told a briefing in Kyiv as reported by Ukrainian media outlet Ukrinform: We are finally leaving after six months of effort. The IAEA is heading to the Zaporizhzhya NPP. As you know, we have a very important task there - to work and examine the real situation there, to help stabilise the situation as much as possible.” Grossi said he hoped to establish a permanent mission in Ukraine to monitor Europe’s largest nuclear plant before the mission’s departure. These operations are very complex operations. We are going to a war zone. We are going to occupied territory. And this requires explicit guarantees from not only from the Russians, but also from the Republic of Ukraine. We have been able to secure that ... So now we are moving.” “I am really very conscious of the relevance of this moment but we are ready. The IAEA is ready. We will be reporting back after the mission. We are going to be spending a few days there,” he added. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. A team of nuclear experts are en route to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from Kyiv this morning amid international concern of a potential accident or radiation leak. Meanwhile, Ukraine has accused Russia of deliberately shelling corridors to make it unsafe for the IAEA inspectors to visit the plant in the south of the country. It is 7.30am in Kyiv. Here is where we stand: Ukraine’s counteroffensive to retake Kherson will be a “slow operation to grind the enemy”, the senior presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych has said. “Of course, many would like a large-scale offensive with news about the capture by our military of a settlement in an hour,” he wrote. “But we don’t fight like that … Funds are limited.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said “heavy fighting” continues in “almost the entire territory” of Kherson. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, Natalia Humeniuk, said Ukraine’s forces had succeeded in damaging bridges that join Kherson across the river, rendering them “impassable for heavy machinery”. A Moscow-installed leader of occupied Kherson has reportedly fled to Russia. When asked by the Guardian about his location, Kirill Stremousov said he was currently “travelling around Russian cities, meeting different people for work”. The previous head of Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, welcomed Ukraine’s counterattacks in Kherson, saying it is a key moment in the war. Sir Alex Younger told the BBC that the fightback from Kyiv showed the two opposing forces had “reached some kind of balance, which is an unexpected and frankly welcome situation”. Ukraine is using wooden decoys of advanced US rocket systems to trick Russia into wasting its missiles on them, according to The Washington Post. The decoy versions of US-supplied rocket launcher systems drew at least 10 Russian Kalibr cruise missiles, leading Ukraine to further boost its production of replicas, in an effort to lure Moscow into firing its expensive long-range missiles on fake targets, the publication said. The last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, has died in Moscow aged 91. Gorbachev’s reforms led to the unlooked-for break-up of his own country, and to the demise of communism across central and eastern Europe. He died after a “difficult and protracted illness”, Russian news agencies cited hospital officials as saying on Tuesday. Recent reports suggested he was had a kidney ailment. The UN’s cultural agency has said it supports a bid by Ukraine to put its port city of Odesa on the Unesco world heritage list of protected sites. The UN agency also said it wants to add Odesa, Kyiv and Lviv to the list of world heritage sites “in danger”. Ukrainian officials said Moscow’s forces are approaching Odesa and analysts believe Russia could soon target the city to completely block Ukraine’s Black Sea access. Ukraine’s parliament endorsed several laws and ratifications on Tuesday to bring the country closer to the European Union, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. “We are moving step by step towards full membership in the EU,” he added. Zelenskiy met with the UN nuclear watchdog chief who will lead an expert team to inspect the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine this week. “It’s an important mission, and we’re doing everything we can for it to be safe and work at full capacity,” he said during a meeting with the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, on Tuesday. The head of the Russian-installed local administration, Yevgeny Balitsky, said he did not expect much from the IAEA visit and told the Interfax news agency the inspectors “must see the work of the station in one day”. Ukraine has accused Russia of deliberately shelling corridors to make it unsafe for the IAEA inspectors to visit the plant. The senior presidential adviser Andriy Yermak said Russia aimed to force the UN team through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. “Russia is trying to disrupt the visit of the IAEA mission to the nuclear power plant by simulating combat operations in Energodar and shelling the area near the nuclear power plant,” he said. Zelenskiy also claimed Russia “does not stop provocations precisely in those directions from which the mission is supposed to arrive at the station”. At least five people were killed and 12 wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv, Zelenskiy said. “Only one Russian shelling of Kharkiv took the lives of five people today, another 12 were wounded.” The wholesale price of gas has dropped sharply in a rare respite from recent highs on signs that Europe is preparing to intervene directly in energy markets. The European Commission said it was working “flat out” on an emergency package, and on a longer-term “structural reform of the electricity market” to combat soaring prices while efforts to fill gas storage facilities appear to be ahead of schedule. The day-ahead UK wholesale gas price tumbled by more than 20% to 447p per therm on Tuesday, while the month-ahead contract dropped by a quarter, to 473p per therm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/06/uk-energy-generators-face-tax-raid-on-soaring-profits","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-06T08:51:31Z","webTitle":"Power move: UK ministers eye big energy profits for tax raid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/06/uk-energy-generators-face-tax-raid-on-soaring-profits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/06/uk-energy-generators-face-tax-raid-on-soaring-profits","fields":{"headline":"Power move: UK ministers eye big energy profits for tax raid","bodyText":"Dressed in overalls with “leave it in the ground” scrawled on their backs, climate protesters shovelled coal over the side of a goods train bound for the Drax power station in 2008. It is now 14 years on from the train “hijack” and government officials are considering their own raid on the North Yorkshire power station – this time on the company’s finances. The power giant, Britain’s single-biggest source of carbon emissions – thanks to the biomass and coal it burns – has benefited handsomely from the link between electricity prices and soaring gas prices, along with a group of nuclear plants and older solar and windfarm projects. This windfall – evident in a quadrupling of profits – has thrust Drax and its fellow generators, which are propped up by historic subsidies, into the eye of a gathering storm. With households and small businesses crushed by soaring bills, the government is considering options to break the link between gas and electricity prices as well as a windfall tax on electricity generators. The plan could be one of Kwasi Kwarteng’s first acts as chancellor if, as expected, he is promoted from business secretary by the UK’s new prime minister, Liz Truss. Germany’s decision to impose a windfall tax on electricity generators may embolden ministers to follow suit. Earlier this year, as the government imposed the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) on North Sea oil and gas operators, a similar measure was mooted for electricity generators – but was dismissed as too complex. A further leaked Treasury analysis claimed gas producers and electricity generators could make £170bn in excess profits over two years. For most companies, precise figures on windfall profits are hard to come by. But for Drax it is clear that the good times roll. In July, the company said profit before tax had risen to £200m in the first half of the year, up from £52m in the same period a year earlier, bolstered by high electricity prices. It upgraded annual profit forecasts, while landing a deal with National Grid to keep its coal-fired operations open through the winter. The group’s chief executive, Will Gardiner, saw his total pay package swell more than 30% to £2.7m. In the past 12 months, its stock has risen 56% to 660p, valuing the company at £2.65bn, after peaking at 831p in April. But the threat of a windfall tax has twice punctured the share rally and it may now face pressure to rip up the contracts for its units which burn wood pellets. Thinktank Ember calculates that from 2012 until 2027, Drax will have collected more than £11bn in government subsidies. The shape of any potential raid on electricity generators’ profits could prove crucial for Drax and its peers. A simple extension to corporation tax – as applied to the oil giants – could prove most damaging to profits and, critics argue, investor sentiment in green energy. Instead, the business department is reportedly scrutinising a plan which would see older Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) voluntarily ripped up in favour of Contracts for Difference (CFDs). ROCs are an anachronism from the early days of green power generation. They were first introduced in 2002, paying renewable energy producers the wholesale market rate plus a subsidy. The scheme was closed to new entrants in 2017 and replaced with less generous CfDs, which offer electricity plants a flat rate for what they produce over 15 years. That rate is the difference between the “strike price” – an agreed price which reflects the investment in green technology – and the “reference price”, which is a reflection of the wholesale market price for electricity. If the market price is higher than the strike price, a government entity called the Low Carbon Contracts Company ensures these savings are passed on to consumers. If the market price is lower, the LCCC makes up the shortfall. LCCC data shows that with UK power prices more than tripling in the past year, windfarms have paid back more than £360m. Under the proposals, those with ROCs would be encouraged to switch to CfDs. The benefit to consumers could be lower bills, and for the company a guaranteed long-term income which could reassure investors. However, the voluntary scheme could be undermined if companies decide instead to take their chances that gas prices will remain high for years. For those on ROCs with only a few years remaining, it could prove attractive, less so for those with a decade to go. Denmark’s Ørsted held the most ROCs in 2020/21, ahead of Drax, SSE and Germany’s RWE. Although the energy market as a whole is dominated by a clutch of large players, nearly 60% of the UK onshore wind ROCs market consists of smaller developers, Bernstein analysts estimate. The ROCs register is public: it shows everything from the Achanalt power station, a small 20 megawatt hydroelectric site in the Scottish Highlands owned by SSE, to the Four Burrows windfarm, owned by renewable specialist RES, near Truro, Cornwall. However, the nature of each site’s contracts remain undisclosed. Many will be tied into long-term electricity supply deals typically agreed between power producers and electricity traders or suppliers. ROCs are also tradable. For larger companies, their power is predominately hedged ahead in the futures markets (sold in advance) – meaning some are yet to see the full benefit from this year’s surge in gas prices. RBC analyst John Musk said: “We previously saw a lot of rhetoric around extending the windfall tax to generators when the energy profits levy was originally announced. It was seen as too difficult then – and I do not see how that changes.” However, industry watchers are confident that nuclear power stations have recorded hefty gains. British Gas owner Centrica owns a 20% stake in Britain’s nuclear fleet, which is operated by EDF. Centrica reported operating profits of £1.3bn, and noted an 11% gain in volumes of nuclear power generated, in the first half of 2022. It said the price achieved for nuclear power had risen from £46.5 per megawatt hour in 2021 to £110.4/mwh. Centrica had flirted with selling off its nuclear stake, but that plan was ditched last year. EDF is also likely to have seen a fillip, however the gains may be overshadowed by the debt-laden company’s woes in France where it is being nationalised. UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) estimates that if 100% of eligible UK wind and solar power projects were to participate in the contracts’ revamp the saving would be £12.8bn and £180 off bills. UKERC estimates that if its proposals were extended to units 2 and 3 of Drax, which burn biomass and receive RO payments, the collective savings would be £14.8bn a year. If all of Britain’s nuclear power stations participated, overall savings would reach £22.4bn. Dan Monzani, managing director for the UK and Ireland at consultancy Aurora, said UKERC’s proposal could lower the price over the next two to three winters in exchange for a fixed price extending for the remainder of the stations’ technical life. “This would spread the impact of the war on Ukraine over more years,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/07/energy-dashboard-how-electricity-generated-great-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-07T12:00:45Z","webTitle":"Energy mix: how is electricity generated in Great Britain?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/07/energy-dashboard-how-electricity-generated-great-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/07/energy-dashboard-how-electricity-generated-great-britain","fields":{"headline":"Energy mix: how is electricity generated in Great Britain?","bodyText":"Great Britain has one of the most diverse ranges of electricity generation in Europe, with everything from windfarms off the coast of Scotland to a nuclear power station in Suffolk tasked with keeping the lights on. The increasing reliance on renewable energy sources, as part of the country’s green ambitions, also means there can be rapid shifts in the main source of electricity generation. On windy days, most electricity generation comes from onshore and offshore windfarms. When conditions are cold and still, gas-fired power stations known as peaking plants are called into action. The electricity system in Great Britain relies on a combination of “baseload” power – from stable generators such as nuclear and biomass plants – and “intermittent” sources, such as wind and solar farms that need the right weather conditions to feed energy into the grid. National Grid also imports energy from overseas, through subsea cables known as interconnectors that link to France, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. They allow companies to trade excess power, such as renewable energy created by the sun, wind and water, between different countries. By 2030 it is hoped that 90% of the energy imported by interconnectors will be from zero carbon energy sources. The technology behind Great Britain’s power generation has evolved significantly over the last century. The first integrated national grid in the world was formed in 1935 linking seven regions of the UK. In the aftermath of industrialisation, coal provided the vast majority of power, before oil began to play an increasingly important part in the 1950s. In 1956, the world’s first commercial nuclear reactor, Calder Hall 1 at Windscale (later Sellafield), was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. Coal use fell significantly in the 1990s while the use of combined cycle gas turbines grew. Now a combination of gas, wind, nuclear and biomass provide the bulk of Great Britain’s energy, with smaller sources such as solar and hydroelectric power also used. From October 2024, coal will no longer be used to generate electricity. Methodology The charts visualise Great Britain’s electricity generation data. Northern Ireland has a separate energy market from the rest of the UK and is not included in the figures. Energy generation data is fetched from the Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service public feed, provided by Elexon – which runs the wholesale energy market – and is updated every five minutes. Elexon’s data does not include embedded energy, which is unmetered and therefore invisible to Great Britain’s National Grid. Embedded energy comprises all solar energy and wind energy generated from non-metered turbines. To account for these figures we use embedded energy estimates from the National Grid electricity system operator, which are published every 30 minutes. Import figures refer to the net flow of electricity from the interconnectors with Europe and with Northern Ireland. A positive value represents import into the GB transmission system, while a negative value represents an export. Hydro figures combine renewable run-of-the-river hydropower and pumped storage. Biomass figures include Elexon’s “other” category, which comprises coal-to-biomass conversions and biomass combined heat and power plants. The Guardian does not make any attempt to fix potential mistakes in the data feeds; all figures should be taken as indicative."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/28/west-caught-between-fear-hope-erdogan-extends-20-year-rule-turkey-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-28T20:24:51Z","webTitle":"West caught between fear and hope as Erdoğan extends 20-year rule in Turkey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/28/west-caught-between-fear-hope-erdogan-extends-20-year-rule-turkey-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/28/west-caught-between-fear-hope-erdogan-extends-20-year-rule-turkey-election","fields":{"headline":"West caught between fear and hope as Erdoğan extends 20-year rule in Turkey","bodyText":"Western capitals remained silent through Turkey’s presidential campaign – privately hoping Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s erratic 20-year rule would come to a surprise close – but now he has been handed a decisive mandate to serve a third term, the west is caught between fear and hope. It fears he will exploit the result to take this Nato founder member further from the liberal secular west, but hopes against hope that, not being eligible to run again and thus freed from the need to pander to a nationalist electorate for the rest of his political life, he may at least be open to persuasion and base his foreign policy on something other than self-preservation. Either way, the choices Erdoğan unbound makes matter not just for Turkey, Nato, and whatever order that emerges at the end of the war in Ukraine. The immediate issue is to prevent him falling into the lap of Vladimir Putin. Few western diplomats are optimistic. One said: “In the past he had turned transactionalism almost into an art form and then almost an ideology. But recently it has grown into a real antipathy towards western values and arrogance.” Erdoğan’s interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, during the campaign said that anyone who displayed pro-western tendencies was a traitor. Perhaps it was merely campaign rhetoric, but it reflects a mindset in Turkey and potentially in other countries. Erdoğan’s first test will come at the Nato summit in Vilnius where he will be asked to lift Turkey’s veto on the Nato membership of Sweden. He has already lifted his block on Finland’s membership but has left Sweden in limbo and in a potentially dangerous grey zone. Sweden, which has a larger Kurdish population than Finland, says it is struggling to rationalise some of Erdoğan’s demands, including for the extradition of 140 Kurds, whose names have never been definitively passed to the Swedish government. Stockholm is toughening its anti-terror laws to please Ankara and is willing to study evidence that the Kurdish community in Sweden has become a large source of funding for the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which is classified as a terrorist organisation by the EU and Turkey. But the rightwing Swedish government cannot order its judges to extradite Kurds. Officials pretend Sweden’s Nato membership is a self-standing issue but in practice most see it as linked to the blocked US arms sales to Turkey, not to mention the future status of the battery of S-400 missiles bought by Ankara from Russia. Joe Biden, despite calling Erdoğan an autocrat, is willing to lift the block, endorse the $20bn sale of F16 jets and open a new chapter with Turkey. But the US president first has to persuade the leaders of the House and Senate foreign affairs committees to endorse the sale. Michael McCaul, the Republican chair of the House foreign affairs committee, recently hinted at flexibility, saying he was willing to endorse the sale so long as the Swedish Nato issue was resolved. McCaul said: “We’ve been assured that after the election, regardless of the winner, that Sweden will be recognised as a Nato ally.” Democrats in Congress still want wider assurances about Turkey stopping its threats to Greece, so talks of a moratorium on military exercises in the Aegean is promising. But even a sale of arms would not in itself end Erdoğan’s resistance to western efforts to detach him from Putin. In the campaign he said Turkey and Russia had a special relationship, and reflected on his personal ties with Putin, saying it put him in a good position to act as a broker over the war in Ukraine. In April Erdoğan launched the first Turkish nuclear power plant built with Russian financial support and technology. More implausibly Putin has talked of Turkey becoming a European hub for Russian gas. All of this has made it harder for the US officials that have travelled to Ankara to urge Erdoğan to clamp down on Turkish businesses acting as a conduit to bypass western sanctions on Russia in support of Ukraine. Turkish deals with penalised Russian companies, trade with Russia in western-made products and the export to Russia of so-called dual-use goods such as plastics, rubber and electronics have all been raised by the US with little effect. Turkey is simply not willing to impose sanctions on Russia, and Washington is not willing to impose secondary sanctions on Turkey, fearing it would drive Erdoğan into Putin’s arms. More broadly the west favours Erdoğan’s plans to lower tensions with his neighbours including Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt and Armenia. In some specific respects even Erdoğan’s re-election is a boon to the west. With his human rights record, his request for EU membership, suspended since 2018, can continue to gather dust in the pending tray, something that would have been less easy if Erdoğan’s opponent Kemal Kiliçdaroglu had been elected. Second, Kiliçdaroglu’s increasingly strident vow to force millions of Syrian refugees back over the border into Syria sounded like vote grubbing without a plan. Erdoğan by contrast sounds more plausible when he says he has a plan to rehouse 1 million Syrians in northern Turkey back over the border. His connections with Putin, and hence the Syrian president, Bashir al-Assad, make that plan the more plausible of the two."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-207-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-18T01:29:02Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 207 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-207-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-207-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 207 of the invasion","bodyText":"The Czech Republic, which currently holds the EU presidency, have called for a “special international tribunal” after a mass grave was discovered in Izium, a town in north-eastern Ukraine. “In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,” said Jan Lipavský, foreign minister of the Czech Republic. More than 440 bodies have been discovered by Ukrainian officials, with some found with their hands tied behind their backs. Satellite imagery has emerged of the recently discovered mass grave site near Izium. The images, released by Maxar Technologies, show the “Forest Cemetery” entrance from March to August of this year. One of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant’s four main power lines has been repaired and is supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid two weeks after it went down, the UN nuclear watchdog has said. Even though the six reactors at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, have been shut down, the plant needs electricity to keep them cool. US president Joe Biden urged Russian president Vladimir Putin to not use tactical nuclear or chemical weapons in the wake of setbacks in Ukraine. Asked by CBS what he would say to Putin if he was considering using such weapons, Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. It would change the face of war unlike anything since world war two.” Biden said the US response would be “consequential,” but declined to give detail. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi told Putin on Saturday that “today’s time is not a time for war” when the pair met during a regional Asia summit in Uzbekistan. Putin told Modi he knew of India’s “concerns” about the conflict, echoing language he had used with Chinese president Xi Jinping the day before. “We will do our best to end this as soon as possible,” Putin said, while accusing Kyiv of rejecting negotiations. Speaking to reporters later, Putin vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s latest counteroffensive and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces target facilities in Russia. Associated Press reported that the Russian president said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. “We aren’t in a rush,” he said after the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting in Samarkand. Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told leaders at the summit that efforts were being made “to finalise the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy as soon as possible”. Putin told Erdogan, who has been a key broker in limited deals between Russia and Ukraine, that Moscow was keen to build closer ties with Turkey and was ready to “significantly increase” all exports to the country. Activists from environmental group Greenpeace on Saturday blocked a shipment of Russian gas from unloading at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in northern Finland, the terminal owner and Greenpeace said. The activists demanded Helsinki stop importing Russian gas after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The security service of Ukraine said that Russia’s federal security service (FSU) officers tortured residents in Kupiansk, a city in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Independent reports that when FSU officers were in then-occupied Kupiansk, they tortured residents and threatened to send them to minefields and kill their families."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/08/chinas-war-chest-how-beijing-is-using-its-currency-to-insulate-against-future-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-07T23:01:33Z","webTitle":"China’s war chest: how Beijing is using its currency to insulate against future sanctions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/08/chinas-war-chest-how-beijing-is-using-its-currency-to-insulate-against-future-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/08/chinas-war-chest-how-beijing-is-using-its-currency-to-insulate-against-future-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"China’s war chest: how Beijing is using its currency to insulate against future sanctions","bodyText":"For more than a decade, Beijing has been trying to reduce its reliance on the dollar, motivated by risks emerging from the US economy – such as the financial crash of 2008 – and the desire to boost its own sphere of influence. But in the last year, a drive to insulate China’s economy from dollar-based sanctions has emerged as possibly the most important incentive for decoupling from the dollar, as China looks to prepare for the possibility of conflict with Taiwan. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, one of the most powerful tools for inflicting economic harm on Moscow was to essentially cut the country off from transactions based on US dollars, limiting its ability to trade with other countries. But as well as punishing the Kremlin, there has been an unintended winner from west’s sanctions regime: the Chinese yuan. Last year the share of Russian imports paid for in yuan rose from 4% to 23%. In February the yuan overtook the dollar as the most traded currency on the Moscow exchange for the first time in its history. China’s push to boost the internationalisation of its currency predates the war in Ukraine and although the yuan is still far behind the dollar in terms of global activity, between March 2021 and March 2023 its share of the trade finance market – the multi-trillion dollar ecosystem that underpins 80% of world trade – more than doubled, according to data from Swift, an interbank messaging platform. China is also encouraging other countries to adopt the yuan for international transactions. Argentina and Brazil recently reached agreements to pay for Chinese imports in yuan rather than US dollars. In April Bangladesh announced that it had approved a payment in yuan worth $318m to settle part of a Russian loan that had been used to finance a nuclear power plant development. It is a rare example of the yuan being used for an international transaction that does not involve China. Daniel McDowell, a China fellow at The Wilson Center, a thinktank, said: “To date, international use of the RMB as a payment currency has primarily involved China on one end of the deal.” “To do business with Russia, foreign partners do not really have alternatives – they will have to consider using less traditional payment currencies, like RMB and rubles”. A defence against sanctions China’s economy is far more intertwined with the west’s than Russia’s is, and many analysts think it would be impossible for the west to punish China economically without inflicting massive self-harm. Still, China wants to protect itself as much as possible, and the internationalisation of the yuan is one part of that defence. In March, a Chinese company used yuan to buy 65,000 tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from TotalEnergies, a French multinational, the first time that China’s currency has been used in an international LNG transaction. Beijing does not want to be dependent on the use of dollars for essential imports, so this is a key step in ensuring China’s energy security. In an article published last year, Xu Jin, the chief economist at China Energy, a state-owned company, wrote that China “must work faster to drive the internationalisation of the RMB” in order to protect its energy supplies in the wake of sanctions on Russia. China has also developed an alternative to Swift as well as a digital currency, the e-CNY. These technological innovations are less important than the political factors that influence the yuan’s international popularity, but they are part of Beijing’s broad campaign to transform its currency into an attractive alternative to the dollar. The campaign to decouple from the dollar is also linked to national pride. A recent report on China’s quest for financial self-reliance notes: “By definition, China can’t claim to be a great power … if it continues to rely on the dollar for trade, foreign borrowing, and the pricing of energy and commodities.” But for China’s leaders, a more prominent international role for the yuan needs to be balanced against the party’s grip on domestic financial markets. Truly internationalising the yuan would mean loosening the government’s control over capital flows and allowing the market to play a bigger role in the currency’s valuation. That is not a risk that the party is willing to take, either politically or philosophically. A central tenet of its economic philosophy is that the state should have a prominent role in the economy. Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, notes: “It’s not the invisible hand,” that the party wants controlling the market, “it’s the very visible hand of the state regulators.” “A more prominent role for the RMB in the global financial system is a nice to have thing. But domestic financial stability is a must-have thing if you want to keep the country running and stay in power”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/dec/14/sizewell-c-government-talks-nuclear-power-station-edf-suffolk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-14T19:07:51Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C: government reignites £20bn nuclear power station row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/14/sizewell-c-government-talks-nuclear-power-station-edf-suffolk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/dec/14/sizewell-c-government-talks-nuclear-power-station-edf-suffolk","fields":{"headline":"Sizewell C: government reignites £20bn nuclear power station row","bodyText":"The government has reignited a row over Britain’s nuclear energy ambitions by agreeing to restart talks with EDF over plans to build a reactor at Sizewell C in Suffolk. The talks could lead to the government taking a direct financial stake in the project before the end of the current parliamentary term in 2024, and using a new financial model that would make the public liable for cost overruns. The formal negotiations over the £20bn nuclear plant will hinge on whether the French state-owned EDF can prove it has learned lessons from its Hinkley Point nuclear project in Somerset, and that a successor plant would offer the public value for money. If it succeeds it may be offered a multi-billion-pound deal that allows it to charge energy customers for the cost of construction while it builds the reactor, effectively putting bill payers on the hook for delays or cost overruns. Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow business secretary, accused the government of “kicking big decisions into touch” and failing to offer a “definitive statement today one way or the other on financing, costs or an overall plan”. The decision to restart talks is also expected to reopen a debate over whether nuclear energy can offer good value for money, and whether the UK needs new nuclear reactors to help meet a steep rise in demand for low-carbon electricity to power a boom in electric vehicles, induction hobs and heat pumps. Sizewell is “a vital next step” in the UK’s efforts to secure new low-carbon electricity as older nuclear reactors prepare to shut down, according to the Nuclear Industry Association. It added that “an appropriate financing model” would help cut costs and unlock major benefits for the UK economy. The decision to restart formal negotiations follows a hiatus in talks that have been dogged by concerns over cost, and the involvement of China General Nuclear Power (CGN), which owns 20% of the project. But environmental campaigners, including Greenpeace, have warned that nuclear reactors are “unnecessary” and expensive compared with renewable energy combined with battery storage technology. The community group Stop Sizewell added that the reactor posed a risk to the natural habitats along the Suffolk coast and the nearby Minsmere nature reserve. “It’s good to see the government is determined to shift away from fossil fuels and create thousands of green jobs but building more nuclear power stations is not the way to do it,” said John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace. “While ministers have been talking to EDF about Sizewell C for years, the offshore wind industry has got on with the job and delivered. If discussions with the majority French-state-owned company ever progressed, the UK public will need to stump up billions of pounds in advance. This money would be far better spent on a flexible grid that can handle the shedloads of cheap renewables increasingly powering the UK,” he said. The government said it would only consider playing a greater role in the Sizewell project if there was “clear value for money for consumers and taxpayers”. It is also planning to back a new generation of small modular nuclear reactors, or “mini nukes”, which can be built at a lower cost. The fresh Sizewell talks were announced alongside industry-wide plans to cut carbon emissions from the energy system while keeping a lid on energy bills and helping to create 220,000 new jobs in the next 10 years. Alok Sharma, the business and energy secretary, said the energy white paper released on Monday will transform the government’s “climate ambition into climate action” through a “decisive and permanent shift away from our dependence on fossil fuels”. The energy white paper also included proposals to cut energy bills, replace fossil fuel boilers, introduce a new emissions trading scheme in the UK and support the North Sea extraction industry in moving away from oil and gas. Sharma added: “At every step of the way, we will place affordability and fairness at the heart of our reforms – unleashing a wave of competition so consumers get the best deals possible on their bills, while protecting the vulnerable and fuel poor with additional financial support.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/mar/07/state-owned-electricity-generation-firm-save-common-wealth","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-07T07:00:30Z","webTitle":"State-owned electricity generation firm ‘could save Britons nearly £21bn a year’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/07/state-owned-electricity-generation-firm-save-common-wealth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/mar/07/state-owned-electricity-generation-firm-save-common-wealth","fields":{"headline":"State-owned electricity generation firm ‘could save Britons nearly £21bn a year’","bodyText":"A publicly owned electricity generation firm could save Britons nearly £21bn a year, according to new analysis that bolsters Labour’s case to launch a national energy company if the party gains power. Thinktank Common Wealth has calculated that the cost of generating electricity to power homes and businesses could be reduced by £20.8bn or £252 per household a year under state ownership, according to a report seen by the Guardian. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has committed to creating “a publicly owned national champion in clean energy” named Great British Energy. Starmer is yet to lay out the exact structure of the mooted company, although he has said it would not involve nationalising existing assets, or become involved in the transmission or retail supply of energy. Starmer instead hopes to create a state-backed entity that would invest in clean energy – wind, solar, tidal, nuclear and other emerging technologies – creating jobs and ensuring windfalls from the growth in low carbon power feed back to the government. The Common Wealth report, which analysed scenarios for reforming the electricity market, said that a huge saving on electricity costs could be made by buying out assets such as wind, solar and biomass generators on older contracts and running them on a non-profit basis. Funding the measure could require a government bond issuance, or some form of compulsory purchase process. Last year the government attempted to get companies operating low carbon generators, including nuclear power plants, on older contracts to switch to contracts for difference (CfD), allowing any outsized profits to flow back to taxpayers. However, the government later decided to tax eligible firms through the electricity generator levy instead. The Common Wealth study concluded that a publicly owned low carbon energy generator would best deliver on Britain’s climate and economic goals, would eliminate windfall profits made by generators and would cut household bills. MPs and campaigners have argued that Britain’s energy companies should be nationalised since the energy crisis, which has resulted in North Sea oil and gas producers and electricity generators making windfall profits, and a string of retail suppliers collapsing, costing taxpayers billions. Detractors of nationalisation in energy argue it can stifle innovation and expose taxpayers to huge financial risks. Common Wealth pointed out that more than 40% of the UK’s offshore wind generation capacity was publicly owned by overseas national entities, meaning the benefits of high electricity prices linked to the war in Ukraine had flowed back to other governments. The study found the publicly owned generator model would create more savings than other options, including a drive for voluntary CfDs; splitting the generation market between low carbon and fossil fuel sources and a “single buyer model” with nationalised retail suppliers. The Common Wealth director, Mathew Lawrence, said: “The energy system faces two acute challenges: the staggering profits being made by generators, and the need to rapidly decarbonise generation. “A publicly owned generator can address both these pressing issues, rebuilding out energy system around the public interest. That is the fastest, fairest, most effective way to build a clean, secure, affordable power system.” Starmer has cited the success of European energy firms with state backing including Sweden’s Vattenfall and Ørsted, which is part owned by the Danish state. The authors of the Common Wealth report argued that Great British Energy could be a “powerful tool” in decarbonising Britain, but said ambition akin to the creation of the NHS was needed to make a serious difference. “An approach to reform that does not go to the root of the upstream problems in our energy system, that does not build out at scale and instead remains a marginal actor in the transition, will be unable to deliver on its potential or, in the case of Great British Energy, its stated goals. In this context, timidity and incrementalism are the greatest risks, and ambition the safest path forward,” they wrote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/apr/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-pentagon-leaker-reportedly-worked-on-military-base-world-bank-to-fund-ukraine-energy-repairs","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-14T01:00:57Z","webTitle":"US attorney general confirms arrest of air national guardsman suspected of being behind intelligence leaks – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-pentagon-leaker-reportedly-worked-on-military-base-world-bank-to-fund-ukraine-energy-repairs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/apr/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-pentagon-leaker-reportedly-worked-on-military-base-world-bank-to-fund-ukraine-energy-repairs","fields":{"headline":"US attorney general confirms arrest of air national guardsman suspected of being behind intelligence leaks – as it happened","bodyText":"This blog is closing. You can find a summary of what we know about Jack Teixeira’s arrest here. Here, meanwhile, is the other Ukraine-related news over the last day: UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi warned on Thursday that “we are living on borrowed time” following two recent landmine explosions near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly expressed fears over the safety of the plant, which is Europe’s largest atomic power station. Ukraine’s armed forces have said Russian troops are attempting to surround the embattled city of Bakhmut from the north and the south. “Every day in Bakhmut area, the enemy makes 40 to 50 offensive and assault attempts, launches more than 500 strikes using the entire range of available weapons,” said Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Ukrainian armed forces general staff’s main operational department. Russia’s defence ministry claimed its troops had already surrounded Bakhmut, but Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, said it was “too early” to say. Prigozhin, whose forces have spearheaded much of the fighting for the embattled city, was responding to a statement by the Russian defence ministry that said Moscow’s forces were “blocking” Ukrainian forces from getting in or out of Bakhmut. Fragmentation of the global economy into rival trading blocs runs the risk of prompting a new cold war, the head of the International Monetary Fund has said. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, said a combination of the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and shortcomings with globalisation had led to a potentially dangerous splintering. Serbia never sold weapons or ammunition to Ukraine or Russia, president Aleksandar Vučić has insisted, following a leaked secret Pentagon report that said Serbia had pledged to send arms to Kyiv or had sent them already. Vučić said he was “quite certain” that Serbian ammunition would appear “on one side or the other in the battlefield” in Ukraine, after having been exported to Turkey, Spain or the Czech Republic. Russia’s prosecutor general said it had opened an investigation into a video showing Russian soldiers apparently beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war lying on the ground. It comes a day after president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged international leaders to act, saying the world could not ignore the “evil” footage, which circulated on Telegram, Twitter and other social media channels, causing revulsion among Ukrainians. Norway will expel 15 Russian embassy officials who it said were intelligence officers operating under the cover of diplomatic positions. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, is grappling with a mystery ailment in jail that could be some sort of slow-acting poison, and has lost 8kg in weight in just over two weeks, his spokesperson Kira Yarmysh has said. “We do not exclude that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,” Yarmysh said in a post on Twitter. “He is being held in a punishment cell with acute pain without medical help,” she said. The European Union has added Russia’s Wagner group to its sanctions list for “actively participating in the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine”. The mercenary group had already been placed on another EU sanctions list in February for violating human rights and “destabilising” countries in Africa. Ukraine’s state-owned gas company Naftogaz on Thursday said Russia has been ordered by an arbitration court in The Hague to pay $5bn (£4bn / €4.5bn) in compensation for unlawfully expropriating its assets in Crimea, which the Russian Federation claimed to annex in 2014. All Ukrainian cities and Crimea must be part of Ukraine again and a real peace will come by restoring the country’s borders, foreign minister Dmitro Kuleba has said on Thursday. “There is no difference between...any Ukrainian city, they all must and will be Ukraine again,” he said, speaking via a video link at a Black Sea security conference in Bucharest. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has awarded £650m to manufacturers working on its Tempest fighter jet, in the latest sign that the UK is pushing forward with the aim of producing the aircraft by 2035. The Tempest programme is seen as a key part of the UK’s plans for defence spending and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has put pressure on the government to increaseits investment. ExxonMobil handed its chief executive a 52% pay increase to $35.9m (£28.7m) for 2022 after the oil company reported its highest ever profits amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Darren Woods’ salary rose by 10% to $1.9m last year while his bonus and share awards surged by 80% compared with the year before. What kind of impact might the leaks have? The nature of the US assessment of Ukraine’s military readiness is bound to cause friction between Kyiv and Washington, while the detailed picture it presents of the intelligence gathered in Russia is likely to help Moscow take countermeasures to make it more difficult to obtain – with human sources potentially at risk. There is another problem for the US: the leak appears to show that it spies on some of its allies. That has caused ructions in South Korea and Israel, while CNN reported diplomats from multiple countries saying they planned to raise the matter with Washington. It may not be surprising that in its public statements, the US is more focused on condemning the leak and identifying its source. Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, has vowed to “turn over every rock” to do so. There are plenty of tools to do that, from time stamps on documents that appear to show when they were printed to registers of who has viewed the documents. If identified, the culprit could face a lengthy jail sentence. But whatever happens, even the might of the US government has no power to remove the documents from circulation. The Washington Post has spoken to a friend of Teixeira’s, who had this to say: Teixeira was a ‘pretty normal guy’ outside the server, said the friend, who eventually met Teixeira in person. He had a ‘slight temper’ and was ‘more of a mentor than a leader.’ Sharing the classified documents was meant ‘to educate people who he thought were his friends and could be trusted’ free from the propaganda swirling outside, the friend said. … ‘I was of the opinion that some of these kids were prone to run their mouths because they spent too much time online, but I was ignored,’ said the friend, who added that he tried to stay out of such discussions. ‘It was pretty obnoxious to see kids who grew up in the suburbs argue about a conflict an ocean away.’ … ‘He loved America but simply didn’t feel confident in its future,’ the friend said. ‘At the end of the day he would side with this country over any other.’ Other members of Teixeira’s server have showed The Post video of Teixeira shouting racist and antisemitic slurs before firing a rifle and said he referenced government raids at Ruby Ridge in Idaho and in Waco, Tex. – events with deep resonance among right-wing, anti-government extremists. The name of the Discord server itself derives from a meme taken from a gay porn video often used for its shock value and laughs, the members said. Here are the key developments in the Pentagon leaks story, and Teixeira’s arrest: The Department of Justice arrested 21-year-old Jack Teixeira, a suspect in the recent leaks of US intelligence online, US attorney general Merrick Garland announced on Thursday. The arrest was made “in connection with an investigation into an alleged unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified national defense information,” said Garland. Teixeira was arrested at his home in the town of North Dighton, Massachusetts by FBI agents. Helicopter news footage showed a young man with shorn dark hair, an olive green T-shirt and red shorts being made to walk backwards towards a team of agents standing by an armoured vehicle dressed in camouflage and body armour, pointing their rifles at him. During a press briefing on Thursday, Pentagon spokesperson Patrick Ryder said that the leak of classified information was a “deliberate, criminal act.” He added that the Pentagon had taken measures to review distribution lists and make sure that individuals who receive information had a need to know, the Associated Press reports. Teixeira was a “cyber transport systems specialist,” essentially an IT specialist responsible for military communications networks, including their cabling and hubs. A defense official has told the Associated Press that in that role Teixeira would have had a higher level of security clearance – because he would have also been tasked with responsibility for ensuring protection for the networks. The leak is the most serious security breach since more than 700,000 documents, videos and diplomatic cables appeared on the WikiLeaks website in 2010. The number of documents leaked is likely to be over 100, Reuters reports. The likely charges could each carry up to 10 years’ imprisonment, even if the leaker did not intend to cause harm, said Brandon Van Grack, a former Justice Department national security prosecutor. Among the clues that lead to Teixeira’s arrest was the kitchen countertop and floor tiles in his childhood home – the surfaces appeared in the background of pictures of the leaked documents. Teixeira is believed to have been the leader of an online chat group where hundreds of photographs of secret and top-secret documents were first uploaded, from late last year to March. The online group called itself Thug Shaker Central, made up of 20 to 30 young men and teenagers brought together by an enthusiasm for guns, military gear and video games. Racist language was a common feature of the group. Speaking in Ireland, Joe Biden sought to play down the impact of the breach. “I’m not concerned about the leak,” Biden said. “I’m concerned that it happened. But there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that’s of great consequence.” Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene sought to cast Teixeira as a right-wing hero, writing on Twitter, “Jake Teixeira is white, male, christian, and anti-war. That makes him an enemy to the Biden regime. Meanwhile, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said Thursday that his country had not sold arms to Ukraine and would not do so, after a leaked Pentagon report said Belgrade had agreed to provide arms to Kyiv, according to foreign media reports. “Serbia has not nor it will export weapons to Ukraine,” Vucic told reporters, according to the Beta news agency. He added that the Balkan nation, a traditional Russian ally, “has not nor will it” send ammunition to either Ukraine or Russia. “There is no paper that would show something like that,” he added. Teixeira’s mother, Dawn, confirmed to the New York Times that her son was a member of the air national guard and said that recently he had been working overnight shifts at a base on Cape Cod, and in recent days he had changed his phone number. A number for Bayberry Farm and Flower Co, a flower business believed to be owned by Jack Teixeira’s mother, went to voicemail. A message said the business is closed this week. The company is based at the same North Dighton, Massachusetts, address where Teixeira is understood to live. It is owned by Dawn and Tom Dufault – public records show that Dawn Dufault was previously known as Dawn Teixeira. The company’s Facebook page had mentioned Jack Teixeira in June 2021. “Jack is on his way home today, tech school complete, ready to start his career in the Air National Guard!” a message said, under a photograph of a “Welcome home” balloon. Here is what we know about Teixeira: Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, has posted a tweet painting Teixeira as a hero. “Jake Teixeira is white, male, christian, and anti-war. That makes him an enemy to the Biden regime …Ask yourself who is the real enemy? A young low level national guardsmen? Or the administration that is waging war in Ukraine, a non-Nato nation, against nuclear Russia without war powers? Otis Air National Guard Base in Cape Cod, Mass, the Air National Guard Base where Teixeira is stationed, states that its mission is to “provide world wide precision intelligence and command and control along with trained and experienced Airmen for expeditionary combat support and homeland security”. It hosts the 102nd Intelligence Wing, in which Teixeira worked. Here is how the arrest happened, according to the New York Times. Heavily armed FBI agents arrived outside Teixeira’s mother’s home in the town of North Dighton, Massachusetts, and started calling the 21-year-old’s name, according to a neighbour. Teixeria emerged, wearing shorts and a T-shirt, an was put in a van. Then, “Multiple sport-utility vehicles and an armored vehicle descended on the home, and agents wearing helmets and flak jackets and carrying military-style assault rifles entered the property on foot. Overhead, a twin-engine surveillance plane circled.” Teixeira will appear in court in Massachusetts on Friday, the Associated Press reports. The emergence of Teixeira as a primary suspect raises questions about how such a profound breach could have been caused by a young, low-ranking service member. “We entrust our members with a lot of responsibility at a very early age. Think about a young combat platoon sergeant, and the responsibility and trust that we put into those individuals to lead troops into combat,” said Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesperson. Teixeira was a “cyber transport systems specialist,” essentially an IT specialist responsible for military communications networks, including their cabling and hubs. A defense official has told the Associated Press that in that role Teixeira would have had a higher level of security clearance – because he would have also been tasked with responsibility for ensuring protection for the networks. Among the ways that Teixeira was identified is through the kitchen countertop and tiles in his childhood home – the surfaces appeared in the background of pictures of the leaked documents. The leak is the most serious security breach since more than 700,000 documents, videos and diplomatic cables appeared on the WikiLeaks website in 2010. The number of documents leaked is likely to be over 100, Reuters reports. Brandon Van Grack, a former Justice Department national security prosecutor now with the law firm Morrison Foerster, said the likely charges could carry up to 10 years’ imprisonment, even if the leaker did not intend to cause harm. Several of Teixeira’s family members serve in the military, the New York Times reports, and the 21-year-old airman joined straight after highschool, in 2021. The paper has painted this portrait of the person suspected of leaking US intelligence documents online: While talking with friends online, Jack Teixeira…assumed the role of a leader. He guided a group of 20 to 30 people, mostly young men and teenagers, as they bonded over guns, racist memes, video games and international politics. … His friends in the online group, a Discord channel named Thug Shaker Central, said in interviews that it was a place that brought together lonely people during the pandemic. Sometimes, when they played war-themed video games, Airman Teixeira wanted to teach his friends about actual war, they said.

Europe’s largest nuclear power station has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, with both Ukraine and Russia claiming that the other side has shelled the plant, risking a nuclear incident. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, has a mystery ailment in jail that could be some sort of slow-acting poison, and has lost 8kg in weight in just over two weeks, his spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, has said. “We do not exclude that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,” Yarmysh said in a post on Twitter. “He is being held in a punishment cell with acute pain without medical help,” she said. A congratulatory post by the 102nd Intelligence Wing about 21-year old Jack Teixeira last July is still currently up on its Facebook page. “Congratulations to some of the 102nd Intelligence Wing’s most recent promotees! Way to go!!” the post said, with Jack Teixeira’s name included on the post. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi warned on Thursday that “we are living on borrowed time” following two recent landmine explosions near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia plant. Agence France-Presse reports: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly expressed fears over the safety of the plant, which is Europe’s largest atomic power station. Russian forces took control of the six-reactor plant in embattled southern Ukraine in March last year. “We are living on borrowed time when it comes to nuclear safety and security at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant,” Grossi said in a statement. “Unless we take action to protect the plant, our luck will sooner or later run out, with potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment,” he added. Two landmine explosions occurred outside the plant’s perimeter fence - the first on 8 April, and another four days later, according to the statement. It was not immediately clear what caused the blasts, it said. US attorney general Merrick Garland announced on Thursday that the Department of Justice has arrested 21-year old Jack Teixeira, a suspect in the recent leaks of US intelligence online. The arrest was made “in connection with an investigation into an alleged unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified national defense information,” said Garland. “Teixeira is an employee of the United States Air Force National Guard. FBI agents took Teixeira into custody this afternoon without incident. He will have an initial appearance at the US District Court of the district of Massachusetts,” he added, thanking the FBI and the DOJ for their “diligent work on this case.” Garland said the investigation remains ongoing. During a press briefing on Thursday, Pentagon spokesperson Patrick Ryder said that the leak of classified information was a “deliberate, criminal act.” He added that the Pentagon had taken measures to review distribution lists and make sure that individuals who receive information had a need to know, the Associated Press reports. The FBI said on Thursday it has “made an arrest and is continuing to conduct authorized law enforcement activity at a residence in North Dighton, Massachusetts,” amid reports that a suspect in the leak of classified information has been identified. The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, will make a statement on the situation at 2.30pm, Reuters reports. Aerial footage released by Sky 5 shows a young man being arrested by a handful of federal agents. The young man can be seen with his hands on his head, clad in a T-shirt and shorts. “This is not just about the Department of Defense. This is about the US government…and how we protect and safeguard information,” said Ryder. “We do have strict protocols in place… Anytime there is an incident…an opportunity to refine it, we are of course going to take advantage of that,” he added. “We continue to work around the clock along with the inter-agency and intelligence community to understand the scope, scale and impact of these leaks,” Pentagon press secretary Patrick Ryder said in a press briefing on Thursday regarding the recent leaks of US intelligence online. “We will be limited in what we can say about the documents themselves … As a matter of longstanding policy, just because classified information may be posted online and elsewhere does not mean it has been declassified by classification authority,” added Ryder. It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The FBI wants to question a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard in connection with the leak of highly classified military documents on the Ukraine war, according to a report. The guardsman has been identified by the New York Times as 21-year-old Jack Teixeira, who reportedly oversaw an online group where about 20 to 30 people shared their love of guns, racist memes and video games. Ukraine’s armed forces have said Russian troops are attempting to surround the embattled city of Bakhmut from the north and the south. “Every day in Bakhmut area, the enemy makes 40 to 50 offensive and assault attempts, launches more than 500 strikes using the entire range of available weapons,” said Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Ukrainian armed forces general staff’s main operational department.

Prigozhin, whose forces have spearheaded much of the fighting for the embattled city, was responding to a statement by the Russian defence ministry that said Moscow’s forces were “blocking” Ukrainian forces from getting in or out of Bakhmut. Germany has approved a request by Poland to export five old German MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, officials in Berlin have said. The Kremlin has denied a report that Vladimir Putin personally approved the arrest of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned in Russia. According to a Bloomberg report, which cited unnamed sources, the Russian president had personally endorsed Gershkovich’s arrest for espionage. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has suggested Moscow may be willing to discuss a potential prisoner swap for Gershkovich after his trial. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said his country would not change its demand that Russia must withdraw its forces from all of Ukraine – including Crimea. Kyiv “categorically disagrees” with the idea that “Crimea is somehow special and should not be returned to Ukraine, as any other part of our territory”, Kuleba said in an address to the Black Sea security conference. Two civilians have been killed and two others were wounded by Russian artillery and aerial attacks in Kherson region in southern Ukraine, the local governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said. Norway’s foreign ministry has said it has decided to expel 15 Russian embassy officials in Oslo. The Russians declared persona non grata are “not regular diplomats, but intelligence officers under diplomatic cover. Their activities are a threat to Norwegian interests,” Norwegian foreign minister Anniken Huitfeldt said. Russia’s foreign ministry said it would respond to Norway’s expulsion of its 15 diplomats. Swedish prosecutors said they had charged a 52-year-old man with illegally possessing and spreading secret and sensitive information about a large number of military installations. “I consider this a gross crime as it concerns a large number of installations that are significant for Sweden’s ability to defend itself in the case of war,” senior prosecutor Lars Hedvall said in a statement. Serbia never sold weapons or ammunition to Ukraine or Russia, president Aleksandar Vučić has insisted, following a leaked secret Pentagon report that said Serbia had pledged to send arms to Kyiv or had sent them already. Vučić said he was “quite certain” that Serbian ammunition would appear “on one side or the other in the battlefield” in Ukraine, after having been exported to Turkey, Spain or the Czech Republic. Russia’s prosecutor general said it had opened an investigation into a video showing Russian soldiers apparently beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war lying on the ground. It comes a day after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged international leaders to act, saying the world could not ignore the “evil” footage, which circulated on Telegram, Twitter and other social media channels, causing revulsion among Ukrainians. Authorities are working to identify the identity of a Ukrainian prisoner of war whose beheading video emerged on Wednesday, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said. The Guardian has not independently verified the origins and veracity of the two videos, but Ukrainian authorities are treating them as genuine. Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear power company, has claimed that a Russian mine exploded near one of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Europe’s largest nuclear power station has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, with both Ukraine and Russia claiming that the other side has shelled the plant, risking a nuclear incident. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, has a mystery ailment in jail that could be some sort of slow-acting poison, and has lost 8kg in weight in just over two weeks, his spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, has said. “We do not exclude that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,” Yarmysh said in a post on Twitter. “He is being held in a punishment cell with acute pain without medical help,” she said. Key members of a Ukrainian state orchestra were refused visas to play a series of concerts in the UK this month in a “catastrophe” that the promoter says cost it more than €100,000 (£88,000). Romania, Moldova and Ukraine have signed cooperation agreements after a trilateral meeting on ways to strengthen security in their Black Sea region to counter threats posed by Russia’s aggression. The three neighbouring countries’ foreign and defence ministers, government officials and international partners gathered today in Romania’s capital, Bucharest, for the Black Sea Security Conference. The aim was to address the wide-ranging impact that Moscow’s war in Ukraine on the region, AP reported. Russia was “the most direct and serious threat” to the Black Sea region and Nato, Romania’s foreign minister, Bogdan Aurescu, said. Calling for a strong Nato presence in the region, he said: Instead of peace and stability, the Black Sea region has become the primary target of the Russian aggression. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who addressed the conference via videolink, also said the Nato military alliance should play a bigger role in security in the Black Sea, and integrate Ukraine’s air and missile defences with those of Nato members. Kuleba, referring to Finland’s recent admission to the alliance, said: It’s time to turn the Black Sea into what the Baltic Sea has become, a sea of Nato. Serbia never sold weapons or ammunition to Ukraine or Russia, president Aleksandar Vučić has insisted, following a leaked secret Pentagon report that said Serbia had pledged to send arms to Kyiv or had sent them already. Vučić, whose leads one of the most pro-Russian countries in Europe, told reporters: Serbia has not and will not export weapons to Ukraine. He added that it equally “has not and will not” export arms or ammunition to Russia, adding: “There’s no document that can prove that.” The document seen by the Guardian is a roundup of European positions on providing arms and training from early March, titled “Response to Ongoing Russia-Ukraine Conflict”. It gives the “assessed position” of each country with a tick or a cross. Serbia is assessed to have “provided or committed to provide lethal aid”. It is also reported to have the “military ability” and the “political will” to provide arms in the future. Vučić said he was “quite certain” that Serbian ammunition would appear “on one side or the other in the battlefield” in Ukraine, after having been exported to Turkey, Spain or the Czech Republic. He said: They saw one shell (in Ukraine), one bullet. So what, and where else would they appear? There are several war zones around the world. Serbia’s defence minister, Miloš Vučević, and foreign minister, Ivica Dačić, have also dismissed the contents of the leaked intelligence as untrue. Serbia is also the only European country to have opposed all sanctions against Russia. Vučić has sought to maintain ties with Moscow and Beijing while seeking not to alienate the US and EU entirely. His government has voted against Russia several times at the UN general assembly over its invasion of Ukraine. Authorities are working to identify the identity of a Ukrainian prisoner of war whose beheading video emerged on Wednesday, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said. The disturbing clip appears to show a member of the Russian army using a knife to cut the head off the soldier. It is unclear when or where the video was shot. The video circulated on Telegram, Twitter and other social media channels, causing revulsion among Ukrainians. The Guardian has not independently verified the origins and veracity of the two videos, but Ukrainian authorities are treating them as genuine. Maliar, during a briefing today, said: All cases and videos that appear in the public domain are being investigated, and this is being done by all law enforcement agencies together, who have the technical capabilities and relevant specialists and experts. A member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard suspected of leaking highly classified US intelligence documents will be arrested today in Massachusetts, Reuters is reporting, citing a source familiar with the situation. The FBI wants to question a 21-year-old member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard in connection with the disclosure of classified military documents, AP is citing two people familiar with the matter. As we reported earlier, the New York Times has named Jack Teixeira, 21, as the leader of the online group where the secret documents were posted. The leader of a small online gaming chat group where secret US intelligence documents were leaked is a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guardsman, the New York Times is reporting, citing interviews and documents it reviewed. The suspected leaker is Jack Teixeira, 21, who oversaw Thug Shaker Central, an online group where about 20 to 30 people shared their love of guns, racist memes and video games, the Times said. Ukraine’s armed forces have said Russian troops are attempting to surround Bakhmut from the north and the south, while Russia’s defence ministry claimed its troops had already surrounded the embattled city in eastern Ukraine. The Bakhmut area remains the most difficult as Russian forces continue “offensive actions in the central part of Bakhmut, as well as in the directions of Bohdanivka and Ivanivske to surround the city from the north and south”, Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Ukrainian armed forces general staff’s main operational department, was quoted by Ukrinform as saying at a briefing on Thursday. He added: Every day in Bakhmut area, the enemy makes 40 to 50 offensive and assault attempts, launches more than 500 strikes using the entire range of available weapons. He said Russian forces had lost nearly 4,500 Wagner fighters and regular Russian armed forces servicemen who had been killed or wounded in the area of Bakhmut. The Ukrainian update came Moscow claimed Russian troops were preventing Ukrainian forces from entering or leaving Bakhmut. In a statement published on Thursday, the Russian defence ministry said: Airborne troops are providing support to advancing assault troops, blocking the transfer of Ukrainian army reserves to the city and the possibility of retreat for enemy units. Wagner assault units “were continuing high-intensity combat operations to oust the enemy from the central quarters” of Bakhmut, the statement continued. But the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said it was “too early” to say that Bakhmut was surrounded. Ukraine has also denied the Russian ministry’s claims. Army spokesperson Sergiy Cherevaty said Ukrainian forces in the wartorn city were still able to “deliver provisions, ammunition, and medicines” and evacuate wounded troops in Bakhmut. Neither side’s claims have been independently verified. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, discussed the Ukraine crisis during a meeting in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, today, the Chinese foreign ministry said. Qin told Lavrov that there was no “panacea” for resolving the crisis, the ministry said. He added that Beijing will continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political settlement and restarting peace talks, the ministry said. Two civilians have been killed and two others were wounded by Russian artillery and aerial attacks in Kherson region in southern Ukraine, the local governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said. Prokudin, in a television broadcast, said: The army of the Russian Federation hit Zmiivka in Kherson region with guided aerial bombs, they hit a school and … one person was killed and another was wounded. In addition, a man was killed during the shelling of a park inside Kherson city early in the morning and another person was wounded in a village elsewhere in the region, he said. Key members of a Ukrainian state orchestra were refused visas to play a series of concerts in the UK this month in a “catastrophe” that the promoter says cost it more than €100,000 (£88,000). The Khmelnitsky Orchestra was due to tour the UK this month with two shows: The Magical Music of Harry Potter, and The Music From the Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit andThe Rings of Power. The shows had been promoted on the UK government website as an example of British-Ukrainian relations. After the orchestra played the Harry Potter show in Belgium last year, the deputy British ambassador in Brussels, Chloe Louter, hailed it as “an incredible honour to have such an iconic part of British culture being performed by a Ukrainian orchestra”. The promoter, Star Entertainment, has accused the UK government of hypocrisy. “They made a big deal out of supporting the Ukrainians but when it came to giving them visas to play in the UK, they didn’t want to know,” said its chief executive, Jaka Bizilj, who is known in the UK entertainment industry after working with Richard Curtis on two film projects and with Bob Geldof on the Cinema for Peace Foundation, which evacuated the Russian dissident Alexei Navalny from Siberia to Berlin. He called on the culture secretary, Lucy Frazer, to stand down if artists keep being treated like this, saying the immigration difficulties experienced by an increasing number of foreign artists “damages UK citizens, culture and the relationship to Europe”. Read the full story here: Earlier we reported that Poland had requested approval from the German government to export five old German MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. That request has now been approved, Germany’s defence ministry said. It’s just past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Joe Biden has said that there was a “full-blown” investigation going on with the US intelligence services and the justice department over the leaking of classified Pentagon documents. “We’re getting close,” the US president said. “But I don’t have an answer.” He added that while he was concerned that sensitive government documents had been leaked, “there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence”. The man responsible for the leak of hundreds of classified Pentagon documents is reported to be a young, racist gun enthusiast who worked on a military base, and who was seeking to impress two dozen fellow members of an internet chat group. MPs have warned that British lives have been put at risk by the leak. Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, said it was “too early” to say that Russian forces had surrounded the eastern city of Bakhmut. Prigozhin, whose forces have spearheaded much of the fighting for the embattled city, was responding to a statement by the Russian defence ministry that said Moscow’s forces were “blocking” Ukrainian forces from getting in or out of Bakhmut. Poland has requested approval from the German government to export five old German MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, officials in Berlin have said. Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said Berlin would respond on Thursday after consultations between his ministry, the chancellery and other stakeholders. The Kremlin has denied a report that Vladimir Putin personally approved the arrest of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned in Russia. According to a Bloomberg report, which cited unnamed sources, the Russian president had personally endorsed Gershkovich’s arrest for espionage. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has suggested Moscow may be willing to discuss a potential prisoner swap for Gershkovich after his trial. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said his country would not change its demand that Russia must withdraw its forces from all of Ukraine – including Crimea. Kyiv “categorically disagrees” with the idea that “Crimea is somehow special and should not be returned to Ukraine, as any other part of our territory”, Kuleba said in an address to the Black Sea security conference. Norway’s foreign ministry has said it has decided to expel 15 Russian embassy officials in Oslo. The Russians declared persona non grata are “not regular diplomats, but intelligence officers under diplomatic cover. Their activities are a threat to Norwegian interests,” Norwegian foreign minister Anniken Huitfeldt said. Russia’s foreign ministry said it would respond to Norway’s expulsion of its 15 diplomats.

If Ukraine is defeated in its war with Russia, China may decide to invade Taiwan shortly afterwards, the Polish prime minister has said. “I see lots of connectivity, lots of interdependency between the situation in Ukraine and the situation in Taiwan,” Mateusz Morawiecki said in a speech at the Atlantic Council thinktank. A Ukrainian man was admitted to hospital this morning with life-threatening injuries after setting himself on fire outside the Ukrainian consulate in Krakow, Polish police said. The 63-year-old man was “standing in line outside the Ukrainian consulate ... when he started yelling something in Ukrainian, took out a bottle with a flammable substance, doused himself with it and set himself on fire”, a police press officer, Piotr Szpiech, told AFP. He added: An officer on patrol and a witness put out the fire. The man was taken to hospital in a serious, life-threatening condition. Initial media reports suggested the man had been urging fellow citizens to return to Ukraine and fight Russia, AFP said. Poland has requested approval from the German government to export five old German MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, officials in Berlin have said. Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said Berlin would respond on Thursday after consultations between his ministry, the chancellery and other stakeholders. He told reporters: The promise is that a reply to our Polish partners will be forthcoming within the day. Swedish prosecutors said on Thursday they had charged a 52-year-old man with illegally possessing and spreading secret and sensitive information about a large number of military installations. “I consider this a gross crime as it concerns a large number of installations that are significant for Sweden’s ability to defend itself in the case of war,” Reuters reports senior prosecutor Lars Hedvall said in a statement. “The information disclosure may hurt national security,” he added. Nelly Kronstrand reports for the Swedish news site Aftonbladet that “there is no suspicion that the man is connected to a foreign power”. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, on Thursday warned that the country’s new status as a Nato member “doesn’t solve every problem,” and said Helsinki should not let down its guard on security issues. “We still bear the main responsibility for our own security. Wherever we detect any gaps or vulnerabilities, they must be fixed,” Niinistö said, in a speech to lawmakers as they gathered for the first time since the 2 April elections. He added that Finland, which shares a 1,340km (832-mile) border with Russia, had been focused on regional security in the past year, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We must not let this level of alertness drop in the future, either,” Associated Press reports the president said as he formally opened the 200-member Eduskunta legislature. “We should better understand how organically the dangers and tensions we are witnessing here are linked with the increasing geopolitical pressures.” If Ukraine is defeated in its war with Russia, China may decide to invade Taiwan shortly afterwards, the Polish prime minister said on Thursday. “God forbid, if Ukraine falls, if Ukraine gets conquered, the next day China may attack Taiwan,” Reuters reports Mateusz Morawiecki said in a speech at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington DC. “I see lots of connectivity, lots of interdependency between the situation in Ukraine and the situation in Taiwan.” Joe Biden on Thursday said that there was a “full-blown” investigation going on with the US intelligence community and the justice department over the leaking of classified Pentagon documents. “We’re getting close,” he said on answers. “But I don’t have an answer.” Speaking in Dublin, the US president said that while he was concerned that sensitive government documents had been leaked, “there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence.” It was the first time Biden has commented publicly about the release of Pentagon documents that were posted on several social media sites. “I’m concerned that it happened, but there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence,” Associated Press reports Biden said while visiting Irish leaders. The documents appear to detail US and Nato aid to Ukraine and US intelligence assessments regarding US allies that could strain ties with those nations. Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, said it was “too early” to say that Russian forces had surrounded the eastern city of Bakhmut. Prigozhin, whose forces have spearheaded much of the fighting for the embattled city, was responding to a statement by the Russian defence ministry that said Moscow’s forces were “blocking” Ukrainian forces from getting in or out of Bakhmut.

It added that “Wagner assault units were continuing high-intensity combat operations to oust the enemy from the central quarters” of the city in eastern Ukraine. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has suggested Moscow may be willing to discuss a potential prisoner swap for the jailed Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich after his trial. Ryabkov, speaking to the state-run Tass news agency, said talks about a possible exchange could take place through a dedicated channel for Russian and US security agencies. He said: We have a working channel that was used in the past to achieve concrete agreements, and these agreements were fulfilled. He stressed that Russia would negotiate on a possible exchange only after a court delivered its verdict in the espionage charge against Gershkovich. Here’s more on Norway’s decision to expel 15 Russian diplomats from the country who they said were suspected of spying while working at the Russian embassy in Oslo. The Russians declared persona non grata “must leave Norway within a short time”, Norwegian foreign minister Anniken Huitfeldt said, adding: “We will not grant visas to intelligence officers who apply for a visa to Norway.” She said: We are not talking about regular diplomats, but intelligence officers under diplomatic cover. Their activities are a threat to Norwegian interests. She declined to say whether the expulsions were in response to a specific incident. The Norwegian government said the activities of the expelled diplomats were “incompatible with their diplomatic status”. The expulsions amount to a quarter of Russian diplomats currently accredited in Oslo, it said. After the Russian foreign ministry said Moscow would respond in kind to Norway’s action, Huitfeldt said: Russia has no reason to respond. We have Norwegian diplomats stationed in Russia, but none of them are undercover intelligence officers. She stressed, however, that Oslo wants “normal diplomatic relations with Russia, and that Russian diplomats are welcome in Norway”. Officials in Moscow’s Odintsovsky district have started printing volunteer military service pamphlets in the Tajik and Uzbek languages, Meduza’s Kevin Rothrock writes. It comes as Russia’s lower and upper houses of parliament approved legislation to tighten its conscription law before a widely anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks. The changes in legislation, which will make it significantly harder for Russians to dodge the draft, have fuelled speculation that Russia plans to announce a second wave of mobilisation, something the Kremlin has repeatedly denied. A large batch of leaked classified US government information, including top-secret briefings, have been discovered online over the past week, with many relating to perhaps the most sensitive arena of intelligence gathering in the world today: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The most significant parts of the leak concern Kyiv’s level of preparedness for an expected counteroffensive. US intelligence officials were pessimistic in February about Ukraine’s prospects for a new attack in the spring, saying Kyiv could fall “well short” of recapturing territory seized by Russia. There are also details of serious air defence shortages and a risk of running out of anti-aircraft missiles completely by May. The nature of the US assessment of Ukraine’s military readiness is bound to cause friction between Kyiv and Washington, while the detailed picture it presents of the intelligence gathered in Russia is likely to help Moscow take countermeasures to make it more difficult to obtain – with human sources potentially at risk. There is another problem for the US: the leak appears to show that it spies on some of its allies. That has caused ructions in South Korea and Israel, while CNN reported diplomats from multiple countries saying they planned to raise the matter with Washington. It may not be surprising that in its public statements, the US is more focused on condemning the leak and identifying its source. Lloyd Austin, the US defense secretary, has vowed to “turn over every rock” to do so. There are plenty of tools to do that, from time stamps on documents that appear to show when they were printed to registers of who has viewed the documents. If identified, the culprit could face a lengthy jail sentence. But whatever happens, even the might of the US government has no power to remove the documents from circulation. Read the full story here: Russia’s prosecutor general said it had opened an investigation into a video showing Russian soldiers apparently beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war lying on the ground. The disturbing video, which emerged on social media on Wednesday, appeared to show a member of the Russian army using a knife to cut the head off the soldier. A second video appeared to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian servicemen lying next to a destroyed military vehicle. In a statement posted to Telegram, the Russian general prosecutor’s office said: In order to assess the credibility of these materials and make an appropriate decision, they have been forwarded to the investigative authorities for verification. Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters yesterday that the video was “awful” but “first of all, we need to verify the authenticity” of the footage. The Kremlin has denied a report that Vladimir Putin personally approved the arrest of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned in Russia. According to a Bloomberg report, which cited unnamed sources, the Russian president had personally endorsed Gershkovich’s arrest for espionage. The initiative came from “hawks among top officials of Russia’s security services”, it said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters: No, it is not the president’s prerogative, it is the special services who are doing their job. Once again, I would like to remind you that this journalist was caught red-handed. Gershkovich, 31, was detained on 29 March in the city of Ekaterinburg, and the Russian Security Service, FSB, admitted the following day that it had picked him up on suspicion of spying. He was later formally charged with espionage, which Gershkovich and the Wall Street Journal deny. On Tuesday, the US state department officially designated Gershkovich as being wrongfully detained, signalling that Washington views the espionage charges against him as bogus and that he is being held as a hostage. Here’s more from Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who has said his country would not change its demand that Russia must withdraw its forces from all of Ukraine – including Crimea. Kuleba, addressing the Black Sea security conference via video link, called the war in Ukraine “a bleeding wound in the middle of Europe”. He said: We are united by UN charter principles and the shared conviction that Crimea is Ukraine and it will return under Ukraine’s control. Kyiv “categorically disagrees” with the idea that “Crimea is somehow special and should not be returned to Ukraine, as any other part of our territory”, he said. Poland is “sceptical” about French attempts to organise talks between Ukraine and Russia, Poland’s foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, has said. In a speech to parliament, Rau said: We do not see any signs that Russia is ready to revise its policy of territorial conquests ... the possible result of such talks cannot be any separate guarantees for Russia, apart from the observance of the norms of international law. His comments came a week after France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, held talks with Xi Jinping in which he urged the Chinese leader to bring Russia “back to reason” over the war in Ukraine. After the meeting between Macron and Xi, the French president said his Chinese counterpart had “important words” on Ukraine. He said France and China agreed nuclear weapons should be excluded from the conflict. But just hours later in Moscow, a Russian government spokesperson said he saw no prospect for China to mediate in the Ukraine conflict and that Russia had “no other way” than to press on with its offensive. Norway’s foreign ministry has said it has decided to expel 15 Russian embassy officials in Oslo, claiming that they were intelligence officers operating under the cover of diplomatic positions. In a statement, the ministry said: The government’s decision is in response to the changed security situation in Europe, which has led to an increased intelligence threat from Russia. The officers concerned “must leave Norway shortly”, it added. The Norwegian foreign minister, Anniken Huitfeldt, said in a statement: This is an important step in countering, and reducing the level of, Russian intelligence activity in Norway, and thus in safeguarding our national interests. Russia’s foreign ministry said it would respond to Norway’s expulsion of its 15 diplomats, state media reported. The man responsible for the leak of hundreds of classified Pentagon documents is reported to be a young, racist gun enthusiast who worked on a military base, and who was seeking to impress two dozen fellow members of an internet chat group. MPs have warned that British lives have been put at risk by the leak. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, is grappling with a mystery ailment in jail that could be some sort of slow-acting poison, and has lost 8kg in weight in just over two weeks, his spokesperson Kira Yarmysh has said. “We do not exclude that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,” Yarmysh said in a post on Twitter. “He is being held in a punishment cell with acute pain without medical help,” she said. Ukraine’s state-owned gas company Naftogaz on Thursday said Russia has been ordered by an arbitration court in The Hague to pay $5bn (£4bn / €4.5bn) in compensation for unlawfully expropriating its assets in Crimea, which the Russian Federation claimed to annex in 2014. All Ukrainian cities and Crimea must and would be part of Ukraine again, and a real peace would come by restoring the country’s borders, Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Thursday. Russia’s foreign ministry has issued a press release about the Black Sea grain initiative, in which it states “Russia reaffirms its position that there can be no discussion of the Black Sea Grain Initiative after 18 May without any progress regarding the five systematic problems” which it claims are blocking Russia’s agricultural products from being exported. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has been holding talks in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, with the foreign minister of China, Qin Gang. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that authorities in Russia have identified another suspect in the explosion that killed the pro-war military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky at a St Petersburg cafe. It named a citizen of Ukraine, Yuriy Denisov. The European Games in Poland must be revoked as qualifiers for the 2024 Paris Olympics because athletes from Russia and Belarus have been barred from competing, amateur boxing’s Russian-led world body said on Thursday. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear power company, has claimed in a statement on Telegram that a Russian mine exploded near one of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Europe’s largest nuclear power station has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, with both Ukraine and Russia claiming that the other side have shelled the plant, risking a nuclear accident. In its statement, Energoatom said: A Russian mine exploded near the control room of the fourth power unit at the ZNPP. The Russian occupiers continue to turn the ZNPP into a military base, mining the perimeter around the plant. And these actions cannot but have consequences. According to sources, an explosion rang out near the engine room of the fourth power unit. As the nuclear terrorists themselves stated, their mine detonated. The sounds of the explosion were heard by Ukrainian nuclear workers who continue to work at the ZNPP. However, the Russians tried to “pacify” the workers and quickly cover their tracks so that the IAEA experts would not see it. Europe’s largest nuclear facility continues to suffer from the arbitrariness of the Russian military and their henchmen, while Ukrainian personnel are desperately trying to maintain the nuclear and radiation safety of the entire continent. The claims have not been independently verified. Reuters has a quick snap that Russia has fined the Wikimedia Foundation a further 2m roubles ($24,500 / £19,500) for failing to remove what the authorities describe as “fake information” about Russia’s military. Ukraine’s state-owned gas company Naftogaz on Thursday said Russia has been ordered by an arbitration court in The Hague to pay $5bn (£4bn / €4.5bn) in compensation for unlawfully expropriating its assets in Crimea, which the Russian Federation claimed to annex in 2014. In a statement, Reuters reports Naftogaz described a ruling on Wednesday by The Hague’s arbitration tribunal at the permanent court of arbitration as a “key victory on the energy front”. “Despite Russia’s attempts to obstruct justice, the arbitration tribunal ordered Russia to compensate Naftogaz for losses of $5bn,” it said. Among the property seized by Russia, Suspilne reported, are the energy and gas transportation system as well as the company’s financial assets. Russia’s foreign ministry has issued a press release about the Black Sea grain initiative, in which it states “Russia reaffirms its position that there can be no discussion of the Black Sea Grain Initiative after 18 May without any progress regarding the five systematic problems” which it claims are blocking Russia’s agricultural products from being exported. The Russian demands are set out as: reconnecting Rosselkhozbank to the Swift payment service resuming supplies of agricultural machinery, spare parts and maintenance service lifting restrictions on insurance and reinsurance, plus unblocking access to ports restoring the work of the Tolyatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline unblocking foreign assets and accounts of Russian companies related to the production and transportation of food and fertilisers In the press release, Russia’s foreign ministry claims that the latest statements by the UN about the deal “distorts data and facts”, and that “despite all the grandiloquent statements made about global food security and assistance to countries in need, the Black Sea grain initiative has served Kyiv’s commercial exports exclusively in the interests of western countries.” The European Games in Poland must be revoked as qualifiers for the 2024 Paris Olympics because athletes from Russia and Belarus have been barred from competing, amateur boxing’s Russian-led world body said on Thursday. The Games in Krakow start on 21 June and run until 2 July, with 19 sports being held as Olympic qualifiers. The International Boxing Association (IBA) said the continental qualifier “totally contradicts” Olympic organisers’ recommendation that Russian and Belarusian athletes be allowed to return to international competition. “For this reason, the European Games 2023 can no longer remain an IOC recognised qualifier for Paris 2024 and must be annulled,” Reuters reports it said. An air alert has been declared across all of Ukraine. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that authorities in Russia have identified another suspect in the explosion that killed the pro-war military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky at a St Petersburg cafe. Quoting authorities, it writes that the attack was “prepared by a member of the Ukrainian sabotage and terrorist group, a citizen of Ukraine Yuriy Denisov, born in 1987, who, through an express delivery service through an intermediary, transferred to her in Moscow an explosive device camouflaged as a plaster bust of a military commissar.” Tass added “the procedure for putting him on the international wanted list has been initiated.” You may have seen that we are testing a new feature across some of the Guardian’s live blogs, including the Ukraine live blog, which allows you to contact the live blogger directly.

Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, is grappling with a mystery ailment in jail that could be some sort of slow-acting poison, and has lost 8kg in weight in just over two weeks, his spokesperson Kira Yarmysh has said. “We do not exclude that at this very time Alexei Navalny is being slowly poisoned, being killed slowly so that it attracts less attention,” Reuters reports Yarmysh said in a post on Twitter. “He is being held in a punishment cell with acute pain without medical help,” she said. The US intelligence leak is also the subject of our First Edition newsletter today. My colleague Archie Bland sums up what we know so far from the leaks about major US allies: Ukraine: US intelligence officials were pessimistic in February about Ukraine’s prospects for a new attack in the spring, saying that Kyiv could fall “well short” of recapturing territory seized by Russia. There are also details of serious air defence shortages and a risk of running out of anti-aircraft missiles completely by May. Russia: The leaks suggest that the US has a remarkable level of insight into Russian military operations, with live information about the targets being attacked by Moscow and details of a plan to pay a bonus to soldiers who damage or destroy Nato tanks. Early this morning the New York Times reported (£) that a new batch of 27 pages shows that “the depth of the infighting inside the Russian government appears broader and deeper than previously understood”. There is also information on the Russian mercenary Wagner group’s plan to expand its operations in Haiti, as well as US use of advanced satellite imaging technology to gather intelligence on Russian forces. UK: One document suggests that 97 special forces operatives were in Ukraine in February and March – and 50 of them were British, Harry Taylor and Manisha Ganguly report. Their purpose there is not specified, but it is suggested that the special forces could form part of a coordinated Nato group. UN: Some documents seen by the BBC appear to describe private conversations between the UN secretary general António Guterres and his deputy about a deal to secure the export of grain from Ukraine to help tackle a global food crisis. The files reportedly suggest that the US felt Guterres was too sympathetic to Russian interests, saying that he was “undermining broader efforts to hold Moscow accountable for its actions in Ukraine”. South Korea: Documents based in part on intercepted communications show Seoul grappling with US pressure to ship ammunition to Ukraine and concerns that artillery shells requested by Washington for its own use could end up being passed on. South Korea has a longstanding policy of not providing lethal weapons to countries at war. Israel: Another document says that the Mossad intelligence agency encouraged its staff to take part in protests over Benjamin Netanyahu’s controversial plans to weaken the independence of the country’s judiciary. Mossad has denied those claims. There is also an assessment of scenarios in which Israel could be persuaded to provide weapons to Ukraine. Overnight the Times of London has reported that MPs have warned that British lives have been put at risk by the leak of classified US intelligence documents. It writes: Tobias Ellwood, [the Conservative MP] who chairs the defence select committee, said the US leaks could “endanger lives”. “Given our long-established lead in scale and capability when it comes to elite forces it will come as no surprise that our special forces are doing much of the heavy lifting,” he said. “But this deliberate large-scale disclosure of sensitive material could easily endanger lives and should prompt an urgent review about who has access to sensitive information and how it is shared.” Dan Jarvis, the [opposition] Labour MP for Barnsley Central and a former special forces commander in Afghanistan, said the operations were “by necessity shrouded in secrecy”. He added: “Any compromise of secret material regarding their deployment or numerical strength is not only politically embarrassing but also militarily disadvantageous. It risks jeopardising the security and effectiveness of those operations and could put lives at risk.” All Ukrainian cities and Crimea must and would be part of Ukraine again, and a real peace would come by restoring the country’s borders, Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Thursday. “There is no difference between … any Ukrainian city, they all must and will be Ukraine again,” Reuters reports he said, speaking via a video link at a Black Sea security conference in Bucharest. Kuleba also said everyone in Ukraine was “devastated” by the “horrific” video that had emerged appearing to show Russian forces beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, offers this update on overnight events in Ukraine. It writes: At night, Russian troops attacked Slovyansk in Donetsk region with S-300 missiles: the school, residential buildings and the city water canal were damaged. In the past day, one person died in the region, and two others were injured. In the occupied Donetsk region, the Russian military has strengthened local inspections and filtering, increasing the number of checkpoints and patrols in order to hide information about the location of the Russian army, the Ukrainian general staff reported. 46 times from heavy artillery, drones and aviation, the Russian army shelled Kherson oblast yesterday: one person died, two were injured. AFP have spoken to Vitaliy Sydor, a Ukrainian farmer who has resorted to desperate measures to clear explosives from the land himself so he can plant crops. “I bought metal detectors and had a bit of a look on the internet,” said Sydor, 28, about his attempts to render the land usable. He had no protective equipment, he admitted, and relies on a friend with army experience. His village, Novohryhorivka, in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region, was within sight of the Russian frontline and heavily bombarded from March to November last year until the Russians retreated. “Wherever you look there are holes,” said Sydor, indicating the shattered outbuildings and machinery. International demining organisations and military and police sappers are out in force, but the area is vast and some farmers, needing to recoup huge losses, are taking clearance into their own hands. “You can wait a long time. No one knows when they will come and demine everything,” said Sydor, adding that he exchanges information online with other farmers on finding munitions. An estimated half of Mykolaiv region’s agricultural land will go unused this year “due to contamination or fear of contamination”, said Jasmine Dann, regional operations manager for demining charity the Halo Trust, which is working in the region. Sydor’s do-it-yourself approach carries “very big risks”, she said. “There is not only the risk that something will be missed but also that the mines might be booby trapped,” she warned.“Other explosives can be very unstable and explode if tampered with.” The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has been holding talks in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, with the foreign minister of China, Qin Gang, alongside the foreign minister of Iran, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and minister of state for foreign affairs of Pakistan, Hina Rabbani Khar. Russia has so far offered a muted response to the document leaks. The deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, suggested on Wednesday that the leak might be a US disinformation ploy. “Since the US is a party to the conflict and is essentially waging a hybrid war against us, it is possible that such techniques are being used to deceive their opponent, the Russian Federation,” Ryabkov told Russian news agencies. The Ukrainian government is assessing the possible damage from the disclosures. The files give details of 12 newly formed brigades, equipped with western battle tanks and armoured vehicles, which are likely to lead the assault against dug-in Russian positions. “For sure, people are not happy,” one official admitted on Wednesday. “Ukraine was criticised last year for not being a trustworthy partner. At the beginning of the invasion, we weren’t provided with weapons because of this lack of trust. We lost a lot of territory and people as a result. This perception was wrong. And now this leakage happens from the US side.” It was too early to say whether the leak would affect planning for Ukraine’s counter-offensive, now at an advanced stage, the official indicated. The attack is widely expected to take place in the south of the country, and possibly in the east as well. Ukraine’s goal is to break the land corridor connecting Crimea with Donetsk province and to evict the Russians from the occupied city of Melitopol and the port of Berdiansk. The World Bank said on Wednesday it would finance $200m to help fix Ukraine’s energy and heating infrastructure, with partners and others to provide another $300m as the project expands. The $200m grant will be used to make emergency repairs to Ukraine’s transition transformers, mobile heat boilers and other emergency critical equipment, the World Bank said in a statement. The World Bank has mobilised more than $23bn in emergency financing for Ukraine, including commitments and pledges from donors. More than $20 billion of this has been disbursed through several projects, it said. Energy infrastructure has suffered $11bn in damage over the last year and is one of the most critical areas where Ukraine needs urgent support, said Anna Bjerde, World Bank’s managing director of operations, on Wednesday. During the fall and winter months, more than half of Ukraine’s power infrastructure was damaged, resulting in countrywide power outages that contributed to food, heating and water shortages, the World Bank said. There is increasing evidence that the intelligence leak was not an intelligence operation by a state actor aiming to discredit the US, but more likely the consequence of a Pentagon policy of granting top secret security clearances to huge numbers of service members, civilians and contractors. The number of employees and contractors in the entire US government with top secret clearance is about 1.25 million. OG appears to have acted as a leader on a server originally set up in 2020 on the Discord messaging platform by a small group of gun enthusiasts and gamers. The group went by several names, but most often it was known as Thug Shaker Central. Starting last year, OG is reported to have posted the documents on a channel on the server he named “Bear vs Pig”, a reference to the Ukraine war but also a viral video showing pigs fighting off a black bear. According to the teenage member of the group interviewed by the Post, OG “had a dark view of the government”, portraying the government, and particularly law enforcement and the intelligence agencies, as a repressive force. He ranted about “government overreach”. The Post said details were confirmed anonymously by other members of the group, and that it had viewed a total 300 photographs of classified documents, three times the number previously thought to be circulating. The origins of the leaks on Thug Shaker Central was first reported on Sunday by the Bellingcat investigative journalism group, which also interviewed the same member, who is under 18. However, the Washington Post said the teen member, who had been in touch with OG “in the past few days” had yet to be interviewed by any federal law enforcement officials by the time of publication on Wednesday night, even though the justice department began a criminal investigation and an FBI manhunt was launched at the beginning of the week. The defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has vowed to “turn over every rock” in pursuit of the leaker. The man responsible for the leak of hundreds of classified Pentagon documents is reported to be a young, racist gun enthusiast who worked on a military base, and who was seeking to impress two dozen fellow members of an internet chat group. The Washington Post interviewed a teenage member of the group, who described the man, referred to by the initials “OG”, from their online correspondence, and shared photographs and videos. The Post also viewed a video of a man identified as OG at a shooting range with a large rifle. “He yells a series of racial and antisemitic slurs into the camera, then fires several rounds at a target,” the report said. OG told fellow members of the same internet group that he worked on a military base, which was not named in the report, where his job involved viewing large amounts of classified information. The leaked documents have laid bare secrets about Ukraine’s preparations for a spring counter-offensive, US spying on allies such as Ukraine, South Korea and Israel, and the tensions between Washington and allied capitals over arming Kyiv. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Our top story this morning: the person who leaked US classified documents prompting a national security investigation is a gun enthusiast in his 20s who worked on a military base, the Washington Post reports, citing fellow members of an online chat group. And the World Bank has announced it will finance $200m to make emergency repairs to Ukraine’s transition transformers, mobile heat boilers and other emergency critical equipment. Here are the other key recent developments: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged international leaders to act after a disturbing video emerged on Wednesday of Russian soldiers apparently beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war lying on the ground. Ukraine’s president said the world could not ignore the “evil” footage, which has not been verified by the Guardian. Belarus has extradited a Russian man who was separated from his daughter and sentenced to two years in prison after she drew anti-war pictures at school. Alexei Moskalyov, a 54-year-old single parent from the town of Yefremov, 150 miles south of Moscow, fled house arrest last month, hours before a court handed him a two-year sentence for “discrediting” the Russian army. The EU has pledged to hold those responsible for war crimes in Ukraine to account, a spokesperson said, while the UN said it was “appalled by particularly gruesome videos” circulating on social media. The UK government has imposed sanctions on the “financial fixers” who have allegedly helped Russian oligarchs Roman Abramovich and Alisher Usmanov hide their assets. Britain is ready to provide an extra $500 million of loan guarantees to Ukraine, taking the total this year to $1bn, British finance minister Jeremy Hunt said on Wednesday. Hunt said the British loan guarantees had been important to underwrite a broader $15.6 billion IMF four-year package of support. The US also imposed sanctions on more than 120 individuals and entities around the world over their ties to Russia’s war in Ukraine. The sanctions targeted people and entities across more than 20 countries and jurisdictions. Russia has hit 333 Canadian officials and public figures with sanctions in what it said was a tit-for-tat move in response to Canada’s sanctions against Moscow and support for Ukraine. Ukraine’s military has again rejected claims by Russia that Russian troops have captured more than 80% of the embattled city of Bakhmut. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern military command, insisted on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces controlled “considerably” more than 20% of it in the east. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed its forces struck Ukrainian army reserves attempting to break through to Bakhmut. It also claimed that fighters from Russia’s private Wagner mercenary group had captured three more blocks in their attempt to seize control of the city. The claims were not verified. Russia has tightened its conscription law, including introducing electronic military draft papers, before a widely anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks. The lower and upper houses of parliament rushed through legislation that will make it significantly harder for Russians to dodge the draft while automatically banning registered conscripts from leaving the country. Russian-installed authorities in annexed Crimea and the city of Sevastopol have cancelled traditional military parades to celebrate Victory Day and May Day, the Russian-appointed leader of Crimea has said, citing security reasons. Sergei Aksyonov’s statement on Wednesday came a day after he said Crimea was on guard and that Russian forces had built “modern, in-depth defences”. Serbia has agreed to supply arms to Kyiv or has sent them already, according to a classified Pentagon document. Serbia is one of the only countries in Europe that has refused to sanction Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. South Korea has reportedly agreed to “lend” the US 500,000 rounds of artillery, as Seoul attempts to minimise the possibility that the ammunition could end up in Ukraine - a move that could spark domestic criticism of President Yoon Suk-yeol. South Africa has said that an international arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine war was a “spanner in the works” before a Brics summit in the country in August. The Russian president is due to attend a summit of Brics countries but the host nation is a member of the International Criminal Court and would be expected to make the arrest if Putin steps foot in the country. The German government is very worried about the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s worsening health condition, a government spokesperson has said. Navalny’s spokesperson on Tuesday said he had lost 8kg in 16 days while in solitary confinement, and that he was not receiving any treatment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/06/the-coalition-didnt-do-much-on-nuclear-energy-while-in-office-why-are-they-talking-about-it-now","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-06T06:07:37Z","webTitle":"The Coalition didn’t do much on nuclear energy while in office.

Why are they talking about it now?","bodyText":"Last week, the Nationals’ new leader, David Littleproud, said it was time for Australia to have a “mature” conversation about nuclear energy while his predecessor, Barnaby Joyce, called for a national moratorium to be lifted and argued nuclear power would be “really important” if the country was serious about reaching net zero emissions. On Sunday, the nuclear power advocate Ted O’Brien was appointed as the Coalition’s climate change and energy spokesperson. In an interview with ABC Radio National, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said he was “not afraid to have a discussion on nuclear” as the country should not be afraid to “talk about any technology that’s going to have the ability to reduce emissions and electricity prices”. He suggested nuclear had been ruled out because it was “unfashionable” to talk about it. So why is the Coalition talking about nuclear energy again? Because despite having not made a serious attempt to start a nuclear power industry in its nine years in government, the Coalition has decided to argue for one immediately after losing power. Meanwhile, the Institute of Public Affairs, a rightwing group with a history of climate science denial that is supported by fossil fuel and mining interests, released what it described as polling showing people were open to the idea of nuclear energy. News Corp newspapers ran its arguments uncritically. Did anything happen while the Coalition was in government? There was an inquiry. In 2019, the former energy and emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor referred the issue to a parliamentary committee; O’Brien was the chair. In a report titled “Not without your approval”, he and other Coalition MPs recommended the government consider partially lifting the ban for “new and emerging nuclear technologies”, expressing hope that what are known as small modular reactors (SMRs) could have a future. There was no appetite to allow the big nuclear plants that have become synonymous with catastrophic accidents at Fukushima and Chernobyl. O’Brien argued development of a potential nuclear industry would take time and should be conditional on a government assessment of technology and the informed consent of local communities. While this received some support from other Coalition MPs, Scott Morrison said the country’s position on nuclear power would not change without bipartisan support. Labor has ruled that out on economic and safety grounds. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Has the case for nuclear changed since 2019? Not significantly. Advocates have acknowledged nuclear power is the most capital-intensive energy technology, takes the longest time to recoup on investment and has not benefited from the economies of scale experienced in solar and wind energy. Costs have increased as technology has advanced. Despite the global push to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the large-scale nuclear energy industry is going backwards. More units closed than opened in 2020. Construction began on only five reactors; four of those were in China, which is investing in all energy types. Excluding China, global nuclear generation is at its lowest level in 27 years. The few major plants under construction in developed democracies have suffered years of delays and cost blowouts. In the UK, the Hinkley Point C station – the country’s first new nuclear plant in decades – is running 10 years behind schedule and is expected to cost at least A$45bn, nearly 50% more than initially expected. What about SMRs? At this point they barely exist. SMRs are proposed to be 60 and about 200 megawatts, a fraction of the size of the traditional nuclear plant. Proponents say they would employ similar technology used in nuclear-powered submarines and icebreakers and would be easier to keep safe than bigger plants. But the world nuclear industry status report, compiled last year by nuclear energy opponents with a forward by the former Japanese prime minister Naoto Kan, suggested talk and media coverage about SMRs was “not reflected by any major industrial achievements on the ground”. It said SMRs in China and Argentina had been beset by delays. Chinese media said its first 200MW SMR unit was connected to the grid in December for an undisclosed price. The report said there had been no concrete steps towards construction anywhere else except Russia – which is pursuing a model that barely qualifies as an SMR, is years behind schedule and does not have the regulatory process expected in developed countries. In South Korea, an SMR model was approved in 2012 but there had been no orders because it costs too much. Plans in the US slowed; a government-backed model by the company NuScale was approved by the safety regulator, but the design was later changed and several public utilities dropped plans to invest in the technology. NuScale is now pursuing deals in eastern Europe. Backers agree that no reactors are expected before 2029 at the earliest. The report concluded there was growing evidence that “SMRs, like large reactors, will continue to be subject to delays and cost overruns and the high likelihood that they would not be economical even under the most favourable circumstances”. Is nuclear power needed in Australia? It is a different story in some other countries, but there are plenty of analyses that say nuclear energy isn’t necessary, and is highly unlikely to be able to compete, given the range of other options in Australia. The Australian Energy Market Operator’s integrated system plan – a blueprint for an optimal future grid – lays out a vision under which the country would run overwhelmingly on solar and wind, supported by better transmission links and backed by “firm” capacity that can be called on when needed: batteries, pumped hydro, some gas (at least initially) and demand management. Even under the most optimistic scenarios for nuclear, most of the transformation would be expected to happen before SMRs became available. While estimates are difficult, CSIRO’s latest analysis of different energy costs suggested that SMRs would continue to be far more expensive than solar and wind energy and at least as expensive as fossil fuel power with carbon capture and storage, which has not proven economically viable. Why does the case for nuclear energy persist? There is an assumption by some people, including Coalition MPs, that renewable energy cannot do the job, despite the expert advice that says otherwise. These critiques rarely address that advice head on. But there is also a long history of nuclear energy being used as a delaying tactic for acting on climate change in Australia, including by fossil fuel interests. It is possible SMRs could play a role globally beyond 2030, but anyone arguing for them in Australia should be asked why they disagree with the nuclear advocates who say otherwise – and why they their efforts aren’t better directed into backing zero-emissions technologies that are affordable and available now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/30/net-zero-nuance-commentary-on-decarbonising-the-grid-misses-the-mark-on-batteries-and-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-30T01:16:06Z","webTitle":"Net zero nuance: commentary on decarbonising the grid misses the mark on batteries and nuclear | Temperature Check","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/30/net-zero-nuance-commentary-on-decarbonising-the-grid-misses-the-mark-on-batteries-and-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/30/net-zero-nuance-commentary-on-decarbonising-the-grid-misses-the-mark-on-batteries-and-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Net zero nuance: commentary on decarbonising the grid misses the mark on batteries and nuclear","bodyText":"Commentary on decarbonising Australia’s electricity network seems to be heading towards net zero nuance, with questionable claims about the costs of batteries and nuclear power in the past week. One claim relies on an estimate of the cost of a multibillion-dollar nuclear plant that doesn’t exist yet, and another puts a multitrillion-dollar figure against the cost of building batteries. First to nuclear power, which, we should remember, has been effectively banned in Australia since the late 1990s. On page three of the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, columnist Piers Akerman wrote an “exclusive” news story showing “nuclear energy is cheaper” than coal, gas, solar or wind. Such a claim would overturn pretty much all serious analysis of electricity costs around the globe. So where did it come from? The International Energy Agency maybe, or perhaps the CSIRO? No. Akerman quoted “new data” from Tony Irwin, who is a nuclear industry veteran and a technical director at a consultancy company with “specialist industry knowledge on the procurement and development of nuclear technologies” with a focus on small modular reactors (SMR). According to Akerman, Irwin’s data showed “nuclear-generated power” costs $5,596/kW to build, compared with $14,882 for large-scale solar, $12,372 for wind and about $10,000 for coal and gas, both with carbon capture and storage attached. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, who wants to see nuclear power considered in Australia, tweeted a link to the story saying: “Perhaps nuclear isn’t a dirty word after all?” But one problem with using Irwin’s numbers is they are based on an estimate of the cost of one particular SMR design which has not yet been built and won’t produce power until at least 2029. The estimate comes from a US-based company that’s trying to build its SMR in partnership with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems which has budgeted more than $8.5bn for the plant. In 2020, the US Department of Energy approved up to $2bn of funding to back it. SMRs have not yet been commercialised. The name might suggest they’re neat and off-the-shelf, but while dozens of designs and development projects are in existence, they are not something any government can currently go out and buy and plug into their electricity grids. Irwin told Temperature Check the numbers had been published on the consultancy’s website in October 2021, and provided a link. His calculations included “adjustments” for the percentage of time each type can produce electricity, the lifetime of plants and how flexible they are, which significantly pushes up the cost of all other forms of electricity except SMR nuclear. The CSIRO’s latest draft of its GenCost report that explores how much different electricity sources will cost says there is no prospect of an SMR plant being built in Australia before 2030. By then, it estimated a cost of between $7,700/kW and about $17,000/kW – at least five times the cost of large-scale solar in 2030. The GenCost report says, by 2030, the costs of other electricity generation and supply – including large-scale solar, wind and especially batteries – will have dropped even further. The secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Institute of Energy, Glenne Drover, who is a broad supporter of nuclear power, told Temperature Check the costs of SMR reactors were “still speculative” and it would take about five years before the actual costs became clearer. He said nuclear power “should play a vital role in decarbonisation for countries that are not blessed with the space, wind and sun that Australia has”. “So we might never need it, but we probably need to wait to 2030 to see how the renewables decarbonisation plan is going.” Dud battery charge Would it really cost $6.5tn to power Australia only on batteries, and are any electricity system experts seriously suggesting that’s what they’re for? The short answers are no, and no. Yet this figure has been used at least twice in commentaries this month. In a column arguing “the transition to net zero emissions will be hard and expensive”, the Nine News political editor, Chris Uhlmann, said whatever technology was used to support renewables “won’t be cheap” and pointed to a report that “calculated the cost of battery storage for Australia at $6.5tn”. Last week, Claire Lehmann, a columnist in the Australian wrote: “The battery storage required to power the whole of Australia has been estimated to cost $6.5tn. If this is a cost-effective solution, then God help us all.” So what’s the basis for this claim? The figure comes from a 2019 report from Industry Super Australia. The authors took the cost of South Australia’s Tesla battery and, in a back-of-envelope calculation, extrapolated that battery’s capacity until it could power the entire electricity grid for a day and a half. That was 7.5TWh of electricity, the report claimed, although the authors said they were not suggesting “any attempt should be made to provide all back-up using batteries”. Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems analyst at the University of Melbourne, said the use of the number was a “strawman”, adding: “I can’t believe anyone still takes it remotely seriously.” The Australian Energy Market Operator’s draft plan to decarbonise the national electricity market has said that by 2050, Australia will need about 620GWh of storage – which includes all storage technologies, including batteries and dams. Expressed another way, that’s about 12 times less electricity than the figure being plucked from the Industry Super report. McConnell said: “There is no justification for the requirement to store the entire grid’s worth of energy for 1.5 days. If that was a legitimate requirement, you wouldn’t try and meet that requirement with only lithium-ion batteries.” Very bad paleo diet Fossil fuels advocate Alex Epstein, a regular guest on Sky News Australia, last week enraged the climate science community by tweeting a chart tracking CO2 levels going back hundreds of millions of years in Earth’s history. The all-time high is somewhere around 6,000 parts per million (current levels are 420ppm). Epstein said it would take emissions increasing until well past the year 2100 for levels to get to even a quarter of that level, and before which “we can expect to have ultra-cost-effective non-carbon nuclear energy”. Regardless of what happens with nuclear energy, an important question to ask is what else could the planet expect if CO2 levels got up to 1,500 ppm? Dr Georgy Falster, a paleoclimate scientist at the Australian National University, told Temperature Check: “The last time the atmospheric CO2 concentration might have been as high as 1,500ppm – about 3.5 times higher than it is today – was during the mid-cretaceous period, around 100m years ago. “The paleo record suggests that at this time, the average global temperature was around 15C to 20C hotter than present – that’s at least double what it is today,” Falster said. “Global sea level was on average 75 to 250 metres higher than present-day mean sea level.” Dr Ben Henley, a climate scientist at the University of Wollongong, said at just 1.5C to 2C of warming, “there will already be catastrophic consequences to many natural ecosystems and humankind”. Recreating ancient climates with spiralling CO2 levels today would mean “practically every coastal city on Earth would be flooded and human communities would be decimated”, Henley said. Epstein may be hoping those cheap nuclear power plants will be able to operate underwater, providing there are enough humans left that need air-conditioners."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/sep/09/tories-decade-fossil-fuel-profits-insulation-fracking-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-09T11:57:18Z","webTitle":"The Tories spent a decade putting fossil fuel profits first.

Now we’re all paying the price","bodyText":"As the full horror of the gathering energy crisis takes shape and the party of austerity prepares to borrow £150bn just to pay the bills, government ministers are desperate for you to remember one thing: it is all Vladimir Putin’s fault. Although the terrifying spike in gas prices is driven by the economic war Putin is waging on Europe, the emergency we face this winter is not simply a product of those high prices. It’s also a product of successive Conservative governments wilfully dismissing policies that would have reduced our reliance on gas in the first place. Take insulating homes and buildings. The past decade has been a period of dismal neglect for one of the most economically obvious policies. Report after report, campaign after campaign, year after year, governments have been reminded of the prudence of investing to make our buildings cheaper and cleaner to heat. Direct grants for those on low incomes, financial support for households and private firms, and properly funded schemes for the public sector could have ended the UK’s reign as the least insulated country in western Europe. Adopting these policies would have cost less than £5bn, and returned money to the Treasury over time through myriad economic benefits, even before gas prices skyrocketed. Yet it seemed there was no one ministers would listen to. They ignored recommendations from the Committee on Climate Change (the government’s official advisers), NGOs, the National Infrastructure Commission and the opposition. The result has been a staggering 85% decline in home insulation installations between 2012 and 2019. Under current plans, it will take 700 years to upgrade Britain’s homes for low-carbon heating. After a decade of inaction, we are now paying the price of remaining so dependent on gas. Successive governments have also ignored the benefits of cheap renewable energy. It is not news that wind and solar power are cheap. This was already the case in 2015, when David Cameron’s government banned new onshore wind farms and pulled the rug from underneath the solar industry. In absolute terms, the cost of solar has fallen by 88% since 2010 and onshore wind has fallen 57%, despite both being intentionally frozen out of new deployment. In relative terms, the numbers are now staggering: building a new solar or windfarm is now nine times cheaper than just running an existing gas power station. The government should be given credit for supporting the extraordinary success of offshore wind in recent years. But there was nothing to stop the rapid rollout of onshore wind and solar at the same time. Had this happened, we would have much more cheap, homegrown and clean energy available right now to ride out this storm. Had the Conservatives not “cut the green crap” over the past decade, households would now be saving an average £220 on their annual energy bills. This figure will probably rise further as gas prices do the same. Imagine what a genuine commitment to energy transition could have achieved. Instead, false solutions won the day. Chief among these was fracking. Despite plummeting levels of public support and repeated warnings from experts that a UK fracking industry would do nothing to lower bills, fracking retained mythical status among Conservative administrations. The dogged pursuit of an industry that went nowhere has wasted precious time and obscured the real solutions at hand. The obsession with getting every last drop out of the North Sea oil and gas industry has replicated a disastrous logic among Conservative ministers. The North Sea fields are in decline for a very simple reason – we’ve extracted, sold and burned most of what was there. Going after what is left will do nothing to lower gas bills because our reserves are a drop in the ocean of global gas prices. Carrying on with fracking regardless, as Liz Truss intends to do, will not lower energy bills – it will merely undermine the UK’s ability to lead on climate action. And then there is nuclear power. Nuclear power produces carbon-free electricity, but it is very slow and relatively expensive to deliver. Hinkley Point C, the first in a supposed new generation of UK nuclear power stations, won’t open for (at best) another four years. It will be a minimum of £5bn over budget. If gas prices never return to pre-2021 levels, Hinkley won’t look like a terrible deal for consumers. But we still have the present situation to deal with. If the political enthusiasm for Hinkley had instead been directed at cheap renewables and insulation, we would be feeling the benefits already. There is a depressingly tired story behind these failures: the power of vested interests. The access of frackers and drillers to the highest levels of the Conservative party since 2010 has left us with an irrational energy policy. Instead of reducing our energy consumption through insulation, and servicing our needs with cheap, domestic renewables running on the sun and the wind, British energy policies have sought to secure the profits of companies. These energy companies have no interest in realising a truly modern, clean and reliable energy system we could all depend on. Borrowing £150bn just to cap energy bills at already historic levels – with most of it going to oil and gas producers – is just the start of the pain. We are ruled by a party that thinks the answer to a fossil-fuelled crisis is more fossil fuels. It is incapable of governing the basis of any economy – the energy system.

Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people. Ukraine’s state emergency service said a 12-year-old boy has been rescued after hours under rubble after rockets hit a five-story residential building in Mykolaiv. Ukraine‘s power grid has been “stabilised” after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said Thursday. A residential building in the southern Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border was hit Thursday in shelling by Kyiv’s forces, the city governor said today. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, denied Kyiv’s military was responsible and said Russia had tried to shell Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on the border “but something went wrong”. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. “Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,” the foreign ministry said. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting on Thursday, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. The United Nations general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine“ and “the attempted illegal annexation” announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, told Russian television Thursday that the vote was anti-Russian and that the west had used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries in order to force them to vote. He dismissed US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine currently only has 10% of what it needs in terms of air defences. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said that Russia will run out of supplies and armaments before the west does. He said procurement processes were in place among allies in the west that will ensure that the international community will be able to continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told Russian state Tass news agency in an interview on Thursday. Turkey’s aim is to stop the bloodshed in the Russia-Ukraine war as soon as possible despite hurdles, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has told a regional summit in Kazakhstan. Germany chancellor Olaf Scholz said Thursday that the war in Ukraine was part of a broader movement against the west by Russia. He said “Vladimir Putin and his enablers have made one thing very clear: this war is not only about Ukraine. They consider their war against Ukraine to be part of a larger crusade, a crusade against liberal democracy.” The Russian state-owned Tass news agency is reporting that officials at Russia’s nuclear power station operator Rosenergoatom have begun the process of transitioning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) to Russian processes, in particular “the storage system for spent fuel of the Russian Federation”. Recently released satellite images show a close view of traffic and bridge repair work on the collapsed part of the Kerch bridge in Crimea. The images made available by Maxar Technologies are dated 12 October. A Russian nuclear strike would “almost certainly” trigger a “physical response” from Ukraine’s allies and potentially from Nato, a senior Nato official has said. Any use of nuclear weapons by Moscow would have “unprecedented consequences” for Russia, the official was quoted by Reuters as saying. The US will need to deter two major nuclear weapons powers for the first time, the Biden administration has warned. Washington’s new national security strategy (NSS) depicts China as the most capable long-term competitor, but Russia as the more immediate, disruptive threat, pointing to its nuclear posturing over Ukraine. “Russia’s conventional military will have been weakened, which will likely increase Moscow’s reliance on nuclear weapons in its military planning,” the strategy blueprint reads. Ukraine’s army boasted of territorial gains near the strategically vital southern city of Kherson on Wednesday. Five settlements in the Beryslav district in the north-east of the Kherson region – Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, Chervone – were said to have been taken from Russian forces over the day. Nato allies delivered new air defence systems in the wake of Russia’s recent missile attacks across the country. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of sophisticated National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (Nasams) from the US. France has promised radar and air defence systems in the coming weeks while Canada said it would provide artillery rounds and winter clothing and Britain pledged to donate Amraam anti-aircraft missiles capable of shooting down cruise missiles. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rafael Grossi had warned earlier that the loss of off-site power at the facility, Europe’s largest, was “deeply worrying”. Ukrainians continue to be asked to reduce their electricity consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. Prime minister Denys Shmyhal appealed to citizens and businesses to reduce power consumption from 5pm to 10pm by 25%. “This is a necessity and this is our contribution to the victory. After all, it depends on each of us how we will get through this winter,” he said. The European Commission will next week present plans to mitigate soaring energy costs. Energy commissioner Kadri Simson told reporters on Wednesday that the commission would bring forward a proposal that includes joint gas purchases by 2023. By harnessing the bloc’s collective purchasing power, she said, the EU could “avoid member states outbidding each other on the market” and thus “driving up” prices. Putin says Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational. The ball was in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via the pipeline, Putin said in an address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. The head of the Russian state-owned gas monopoly supplier, Gazprom, has warned Europe of the consequences of renouncing Russian gas. There is “no guarantee” that Europe would survive winter based on its current gas storage capacity, Alexei Miller said, adding that gas in Germany’s underground storage would be enough for between two- and two-and-a-half months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/13/australia-faces-looming-nuclear-skills-challenge-to-support-aukus-submarines","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-13T07:27:22Z","webTitle":"Australia faces looming nuclear skills challenge to support Aukus submarines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/13/australia-faces-looming-nuclear-skills-challenge-to-support-aukus-submarines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/13/australia-faces-looming-nuclear-skills-challenge-to-support-aukus-submarines","fields":{"headline":"Australia faces looming nuclear skills challenge to support Aukus submarines","bodyText":"Australia will need to significantly scale up local nuclear education and training to build sufficient expertise for the multi-decade Aukus submarine plan, experts say. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is expected to unveil the plan on Tuesday morning AEDT, with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the US president, Joe Biden. The Australian government estimates that Aukus will support 20,000 jobs over 30 years, across the Australian Defence Force, the public service and private industry. It poses a looming challenge to educate, train and recruit the necessary personnel, but experts say Australia has a good base from which to expand its nuclear industry. Dr Patrick Burr, a senior lecturer in nuclear engineering at the University of New South Wales, said “we definitely have a healthy nuclear industry in Australia, but it’s often overlooked”, citing nuclear safeguards and research into nuclear materials, nuclear medicine and waste. “On the other hand … it needs to grow manyfold.” Prof Gregory Lane, who convenes the master of nuclear science program at the Australian National University, agrees. “There’s a lot of knowledge about nuclear science. It’s required in all sorts of different areas: mining, health, sterilisation of materials for general industry, industrial gauging.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup UNSW administers the only nuclear engineering degrees in the country, while the ANU is the only one to educate students in nuclear science. “The skills are available in Australia but there are specifics of [Aukus] that we’ve never had to deal with and they’re going to have to be developed over time,” Lane said, adding: “Fundamentally, we don’t have a nuclear power program in Australia.” The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto), a government agency, runs a nuclear research reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney. Lane describes the Ansto reactor as “one of the most technologically advanced reactors of its type”, which produces neutrons for experiments and to make medical isotopes. “But that’s a very different beast to a reactor that is used for power and then a reactor that you’re going put under water and needs to be absolutely failsafe.” Burr and Lane agree that some nuclear personnel will need to be trained overseas. V Adm Jonathan Mead confirmed last week that some Royal Australian Navy officers were completing a nuclear reactor course in the US and also enrolled in UNSW and ANU programs. Burr said UNSW had about 125 graduates each year across its undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, while Lane said more than 20 students were currently enrolled in the ANU master’s program. For the nuclear-powered submarines, “suitably qualified and experienced personnel” will be required at three tiers of expertise, Burr said. The first tier are those who are “nuclear aware”, which would require only several months of training, Burr said. “In a nuclear submarine … even something as simple as welding a pipe needs to be done by a nuclear-aware welder” – someone with additional training about the implications of working with nuclear-grade materials. “If the weld goes wrong while you’re at sea, it could be catastrophic.” The second tier are people who “have somewhere between five and 10 years of experience, and they typically have an education in engineering as well”. The third tier, requiring the most expertise, are those with 20 to 30 years’ experience and a PhD at a minimum. UNSW modelling, led by Dr Edward Obbard, forecasts that operating and maintaining eight nuclear-propelled submarines would directly require several thousand tier 1 personnel, about 2,500 people at tier 2 and about 200 tier 3 subject matter experts. Experts say scaling up local nuclear capabilities will require national coordination. “This needs to be a coordinated, collaborative effort from all nuclear training and education institutions in Australia,” Burr said. “Ansto will have a crucial role to play, not in education, but in some level of training and some level of government advisory.” Lane said: “We need to be looking at regulation, law, engineering, strategic studies, health – all of these things matter in supporting a nuclear submarine effort.” Ansto declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/26/russian-weapons-manufacturers-hosted-at-saudi-trade-event","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-26T11:00:33Z","webTitle":"Russian weapons manufacturers hosted at Saudi trade event","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/26/russian-weapons-manufacturers-hosted-at-saudi-trade-event","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/26/russian-weapons-manufacturers-hosted-at-saudi-trade-event","fields":{"headline":"Russian weapons manufacturers hosted at Saudi trade event","bodyText":"Seven sanctioned Russian companies, including a manufacturer of military helicopters deployed in the war in Ukraine, are visiting Saudi Arabia next week as part of a trade mission to increase business with the Gulf state. Companies including weapons manufacturers with direct links to the Russian military, state corporations involved in the invasion of Ukraine, and the agency overseeing a Ukrainian nuclear plant in the country seized by the Russian military last year, are set to attend. Saudi Arabia’s willingness to develop business ties with Russian companies sanctioned by western states for their role in the invasion of Ukraine is likely to cause further tensions in its already strained relationship with Washington. The Russian deputy industry and trade minister, Alexey Gruzdev, praised the trade event as the first of its kind. “Our business mission to Riyadh is aimed to strengthen the economic ties between Russia and Saudi Arabia, discover new business opportunities, exchange ideas and establish long-term partnership,” he said. Companies integral to the Russian military industrial sector are listed as attendees at the event in Riyadh on Monday. They include Russian Helicopters, the manufacturer of the Ka-52 Alligator helicopter. At least 35 Ka-52s have been shot down by Ukrainian forces or abandoned by Russia, according to the Dutch open-source outlet Oryx. Kamaz, an armoured vehicle manufacturer sanctioned for its role in aiding Russia’s war effort, is also listed as attending. Its trucks were spotted in Belarus in March 2022 carrying Iskander missiles that were allegedly launched in the early days of the invasion, and its Typhoon vehicles have also been reported transporting Russian soldiers across Ukrainian territory. Perhaps the most significant participant in the meetings with the Saudis is Rostec, a Russian state-owned defence systems and technology corporation that has supplied weapons used during the invasion of Ukraine. These included the Solntsepyok heavy flamethrower systems, the Zemledeliye remote mine-laying vehicles and various launch rocket systems. The US Treasury described Rostec as “the cornerstone of Russia’s defence, industrial, technology, and manufacturing sectors” in a sanctions notice published in June. Also listed as attending is Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear energy company. According to Ukrainian officials and reports, Rosatom facilitated the Russian military’s seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant last year, and has since taken over managing the facility. Rosatom denies the claims. A source familiar with the objectives of the Saudi trade event said Russian delegates were seeking to secure joint investment for business projects, assistance sustaining oil and gas prices and other diplomatic support. The source, who asked not to be named, said the Saudi investment ministry was exploring the possibility of opening an office in Moscow, and that a similar trade forum with Chinese businesses had also been held recently, although those businesses did not involve firms with connections to the Chinese military. “What is different here, and these recent business events are just one sign of it, is a major reorientation of Saudi policy towards Russia and China, and away from the USA and west Europe,” the source said. Saudi’s relationship with Moscow has created tensions in Washington. Last year, the kingdom sided with Russia over US interests when it decided to cut oil production shortly before the US midterm elections, prompting Joe Biden to threaten that the kingdom would face “consequences”. Asked about the planned Saudi-Russian trade meeting, a state department spokesperson said the US would continue to focus on “ensuring that our sanctions and export controls are properly enforced”. “We encourage countries and business to do their due diligence and refrain from conducting transactions with sanctioned persons, to avoid exposure to sanctions,” the spokesperson said. The US Treasury did not respond to a request for comment. The White House has backed off on its threats against Riyadh since last year. But anger towards the government of Mohammed bin Salman is still rife among Democrats and various Republicans on Capitol Hill, including some who have said they are concerned that Saudi Arabia could share sensitive US defence technology with its Russian allies. Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman and longtime Saudi critic, said: “Saudi Arabia’s support for Russia in addition to its history of human rights violations should spark a serious review of the US-Saudi relationship.” Next week’s trade gathering could also frustrate the UK government, taking place shortly after a British trade mission aimed at securing an investment deal between the UK and the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which Saudi Arabia is a member. Seated next to the UK business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, at the Qatar Economic Forum this week, the Saudi investment minister, Khalid Al-Falih, declared Riyadh “the political capital of the Middle East”. Falih’s deputy is listed as a speaker of the Russian trade gathering next week. Saudi Arabia’s attempts to situate itself geopolitically as a partner to several leading powers – essentially playing all sides – was evident at a conference in California earlier this month, when Falih told business and political figures that Riyadh had no intention of being constrained by pre-existing relationships. He said: “We don’t feel that our relationship with the US is going to be at the expense of our ability to have relationships with other strong economic and political friends and partners around the world. This goes back to a multi-polar world where emerging middle powers … are going to be seeking their own interests.” Visibly irritated when asked about tensions between Washington and Riyadh, Falih observed that Saudi trade with China already exceeded that with the US and the EU combined. He said: “Do you expect us to put that at risk, just so that a certain country would feel that we’re on their side?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/20/germany-plans-to-ban-installation-of-most-oil-and-gas-heating-from-2024","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-20T15:42:33Z","webTitle":"Germany plans to ban installation of most oil and gas heating from 2024 ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/20/germany-plans-to-ban-installation-of-most-oil-and-gas-heating-from-2024","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/20/germany-plans-to-ban-installation-of-most-oil-and-gas-heating-from-2024","fields":{"headline":"Germany plans to ban installation of most oil and gas heating from 2024 ","bodyText":"Germany plans to ban the installation of most oil and gas heating systems from next year, with proposals approved on Wednesday triggering angry divisions in the cabinet. The radical plans are designed to transform Germany’s heating systems in an attempt to meet net zero emission targets that critics have called unworkable and discriminatory. About half of Germany’s 41m households currently use natural gas heating, and almost a quarter use heating oil. Championed by the economics minister, Robert Habeck of the Greens, the bill is due to come to parliament in June. But the pro-business FDP has lashed out, calling it the equivalent of an “atomic bomb” for Germany and expressing concerns about its effect on the economy, the burden it will put on poorer households and the technical practicalities of implementing it. The FDP’s leader, Christian Lindner, who is also the finance minister, indicated in a protocol note sent to his cabinet colleagues that he was prepared to support the bill only if changes were made. He said he feared the budget needed to carry out the task would in effect blow up Germany’s tight debt control mechanisms. The party’s general secretary, Bijan Djir-Sarai, said the proposal was not practical and would have to be changed. The opposition CDU, which has said it would oppose the bill, has called it a “crowbar reform”, and Jens Spahn, the vice-parliamentary group leader, said his party would “do everything possible to ensure this law doesn’t happen in this form”. Environmentalists have largely welcomed the proposal, with Greenpeace calling it a long overdue milestone. Many experts have said it does not go far enough. Habeck said it was a necessary part of Germany’s ambition to become carbon neutral by 2045, and he said the country was lagging behind. “Comparative to other countries who’ve done this earlier, we’re starting late with this,” he said, referring to Nordic countries, which are far less reliant on fossil fuels to heat their homes. He hit back at the criticism from the FDP, saying that “gazing in astonishment at a problem does not make things better”. If the bill is passed in June, it will enact a virtual ban on the installation of gas and oil heating from 2024. It will require almost all newly installed heating systems to run on 65% renewable energy in new as well as old buildings, in which defunct models would need to be replaced. Homeowners will be encouraged to install heat pumps to run on renewable sources of electricity, or to switch to district heating, electric or solar thermal systems. Biomass heat, hydrogen and gas obtained from an approved environmentally friendly source, such as biomethane, will all be encouraged under a programme of subsidy payments of 10-40% for each heating system,. In addition, “Klimabonis” or additional climate bonus payments, will be available in certain cases, for instance if someone voluntarily switches to a more climate-friendly system, regardless of their income. The challenge will be to make these energy sources more readily available. Other questions relate to a shortage of heating engineers – industry estimates a shortfall of 60,000 workers – supply chain problems and lack of technological development. Heat pumps are still thought unsuitable for many older types of houses, for which they require large amounts of electricity to be effective, even as the bigger heating sector providers are working feverishly to improve the systems. Homeowners over the age of 80 will be exempted from having to switch to new systems, as will those who receive social welfare benefits. Germany’s Association of Local Utilities (VKU), which governs municipal infrastructure, urged the government to extend the transition periods, calling the proposed law an “emotional rollercoaster”. A poll by the Forsa Institute showed 78% of Germans were against the plans and 62% expected heating bills to increase as a result of the move to renewables. The scheme is initially expected to cost German taxpayers about €9.16bn a year until 2028, decreasing to €5bn from 2029 as renewable energy expansion and a reduction in the cost of heat pumps because of mass production help to offset costs. It is to be financed from the €180bn Climate and Transformation Fund, into which the money raised from a CO2 emission levy on fossil fuels is paid. A large segment of this fund is already dedicated to building insulation projects to make them more energy efficient, prompting concerns that finances may be tight. Fines of €5,000-€50,000 can be imposed on people failing to abide by the law. The discussion about phasing out gas heating in Germany was the preserve of environment experts until Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, which halted gas and oil supplies from Russia and turbo-charged the decision to switch from fossil fuel imports. Last week, Germany turned off the last of its three working nuclear power plants, after decades of discussion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-439-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-08T15:31:18Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 439 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-439-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-439-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 439 of the invasion","bodyText":"A Russian missile attack overnight destroyed a Red Cross warehouse containing aid in Odesa. The Odesa regional organisation of the Red Cross society said workers and volunteers were not in the 1,000 sq metre unit at the time. “The provision of humanitarian aid and the activities of some projects of the Odesa Regional Organisation of the Red Cross of Ukraine have been suspended,” the statement added. At least five people were wounded by Russian strikes on Kyiv, city officials said, as Moscow launched another large-scale attack on Ukraine. Three people were injured in blasts in Kyiv’s Solomyanskyi district and two others were injured when drone wreckage fell on to the Sviatoshyn district, both west of the capital’s centre, mayor Vitali Klitschko said on his Telegram messaging channel. Russian artillery shelling wounded eight people, including a nine-year-old boy, in two villages in Kherson, regional officials said. Six civilians were wounded in the village of Stanislav on the right bank of the Dnipro estuary, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said, Reuters reports. About 100,000 Russian soldiers have died in the battle to capture Bakhmut, a Ukrainian general has claimed. Col Serhiy Cherevaty, who is spokesperson for the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said that they were “rough calculations” in an interview on Ukrainian TV. He said: “I am sure that further verification will only show an increase in this number. This is natural as the enemy uses the so-called meat assaults as the main method of waging war.” Russia’s Wagner mercenary group appears to have ditched plans to withdraw from Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, saying they had been promised more arms by Moscow. Ukraine’s general in charge of the defence of the besieged city said late on Sunday that Russia had intensified shelling and hoped to take Bakhmut by Tuesday, Victory Day in Russia, the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi vowed to do everything he could to prevent it. Russian investigators have charged a man with terrorism offences after a car bombing wounded a prominent Russian nationalist writer. The explosion in Nizhny Novgorod, western Russia on Saturday, broke both legs of Zakhar Prilepin, an ardent supporter of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. His close associate, who was in the car with him, was killed. Alexander Permyakov was charged with committing a “terrorist act” and illegal handling of explosives, the prosecutor general’s office said in a statement, according to Reuters. Prilepin has written a description of the car bombing that killed his assistant and left him badly injured on Telegram, in his first comments since the attack on Saturday. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv on Tuesday, the European Commission announced. The EU could impose penalties on countries helping Moscow dodge western sanctions as part of a drive to close loopholes in the regime of restrictions on the Russian economy. A draft EU regulation seen by the Guardian proposes that non-EU countries could be included in future sanctions if shown to be at “particularly high risk of being used for circumvention against Russia”. A total of 1,679 people, including 660 children, have been evacuated from areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, a Moscow-installed official in the Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporizhzhia region has said. The head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has warned that the situation around the plant has become “potentially dangerous” with Ukraine expected to start a much-anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-held territory soon, including in the Zaporizhzhia region. Zelenskiy marked the anniversary of the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945 by saying he would formalise a day of remembrance in Ukraine on 8 May when other western countries celebrate Europe’s victory. Russia’s population has declined by 2 million more than expected over the last three years, according to UK intelligence. Nine Ukrainian explosives experts who were engaged in de-mining were killed in a single Russian attack in the southern Kherson region on Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest evening address. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has threatened anyone convicted of carrying out Saturday’s attack on nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin with death in prison. Writing on Telegram, Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said that any suspects, “like other criminals, will be tried for the attack and sentenced to long prison terms”. Prilepin, who was injured in a car explosion on Saturday, has been brought out of a medically induced coma, according to local officials. Five people have been injured in a strike on the city of Balakliia, local authorities have said. Oleg Synegubov, the governor of eastern Kharkiv region, said on Telegram that a missile landed near a car park on Sunday. Sixteen settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were hit by a total of 75 strikes over the past day, according to the local military administration. A 72-year-old woman has been killed and two people were injured by shelling in the southern Dnipro region, local officials said. The number of Russian soldiers killed or injured since the start of the war stands at 193,430, according to the latest estimates from the Ukrainian military.

The Ukrainian government reported earlier on Friday that the Russian army was “firing from all sides” upon the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – the largest of its kind in Europe – and a fire had broken out. The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, said: “The world condemns that behaviour and Australia strongly so.” Authorities at the plant have since said the facility is secured and “nuclear safety is now guaranteed” but the incident attracted the concern of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which said the fire had not affected “essential” equipment. Payne told the ABC: “That just seems to me to absolutely reinforce the complete breach of any aspect of international law, and all aspects of international law, that apply here, of the UN charter, and to reinforce the unlawful behaviour that President Putin is engaged in.” The minister also argued Australian sanctions were starting to have an effect, with $45m belonging to a designated Russian entity currently being “frozen in an Australian financial institution”, although she did not go into details. Payne said the coordination of sanctions among Australia, Europe, the UK, the US, Japan and South Korea was “a very important indicator of that strength of unity globally in opposition to Russia’s appalling actions”. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he did not believe Putin would be “dissuaded from his murderous acts” in Ukraine, but that should not stop the rest of the world from “tightening the vice” on the Russian leader. Morrison raised “deep concerns” about the close alignment between China and Russia. He told radio station 6PR it was important to send a “very clear message to anyone else, any other autocratic regime, and we know about a few of those in our own region … [to] not take the wrong lesson out of this”. Morrison acknowledged there were differences between Taiwan – the democratically governed island of 24 million people that Beijing claims as its breakaway province – and Ukraine. But he also called for greater preparedness for potential instability in the Indo-Pacific region, after joining an urgently convened virtual meeting with his counterparts from Japan, India and the US – known as the Quad – early Friday morning. The Quad meeting discussed the crisis in Ukraine and “assessed its broader implications” – but the joint statement issued by the four leaders did not include any direct criticism of Russia, and said countries in the Indo-Pacific must be “free from military, economic, and political coercion”. India is particularly keen to keep the Quad focused on the Indo-Pacific, and it has so far abstained from UN votes condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Morrison played down the lack of unity with India on the response to Ukraine, saying he “wouldn’t put them in the same category as China, not even remotely”. The prime minister noted India was calling for an end to the violence, and said Australia needed to “work patiently with our partners”. The New York Times reported this week that senior Chinese officials had told their Russian counterparts in early February not to invade Ukraine before the conclusion of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. The paper cited Biden administration officials and a European official who cited a western intelligence report. China’s foreign ministry vehemently denied the report, denouncing it as “fake news” designed to “divert attention and shift blame, which is utterly despicable”. The foreign ministry also blamed Nato’s eastward expansion and the US administration’s attitude towards Ukraine’s Nato membership for the deterioration of relations with Russia. Payne told 4BC radio it was “ultimately for China” to respond to the reports, but added: “Any collaboration on this illegal, unjustified and unprovoked Russian invasion would be deeply concerning.” The Australian opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said China had a “particular responsibility” to use its close relationship with Russia to press for an end to the aggression. While the Australian government has rapidly expanded sanctions against Russian political and business figures since last week’s invasion of Ukraine, it has also quietly updated regulations allowing it to target Myanmar’s military junta. The changes take effect on Saturday, more than a year after the coup in Myanmar, and are intended to expand the “toolkit” available to the government. The expanded criteria will allow the government to impose sanctions on current or former members of a range of junta-linked bodies. They include Myanmar’s State Administration Council, which is chaired by commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. The new regulations are a preparatory step that will make it easier to introduce sanctions against junta figures, but it would still require Payne to make further decisions naming individuals. Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch, welcomed the creation of a “clear pathway to sanction individuals and entities connected to the junta” and urged the Australian government to act “without delay”. “It has a lot of catching up to do with like-minded governments following the coup one year ago,” Pearson said. The Australian government has never ruled out expanding sanctions on Myanmar’s military figures, but it has sought to remain in close coordination with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Leaders in the region have become increasingly frustrated about a lack of progress in implementing Asean’s “five-point consensus” to resolve the crisis in Myanmar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/03/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-192-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-03T00:38:30Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 192 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/03/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-192-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/03/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-192-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 192 of the invasion","bodyText":"The Russian energy company Gazprom announced that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 would not restart on schedule on Saturday, citing turbine damage. Gazprom’s CEO, Alexei Miller, indicated that Siemens could not carry out repairs because of sanctions. The European Commission chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, said Gazprom was staging the shutdown “under fallacious pretences”. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, who returned from a first visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, said six of the team’s experts remained at the site to continue the work. He told reporters the mission would produce a report early next week of its findings. Grossi said military operations were increasing in the region of the plant, “which worries me a lot”. He said the military presence was not available when he asked to speak to them about the control centre, they did not approach his team and they were “withdrawn” throughout their visit to the Russian-controlled facility in south-eastern Ukraine . Finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) nations have announced they plan to implement a price cap on Russian oil. In a statement, the ministers said the cap was designed to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression” and that they would “urgently work on the finalisation and implementation” of the measure, but left out key details of the plan. Prior to the G7 announcement, the Kremlin said imposing the price cap would trigger Russian retaliation. If G7 leaders went ahead it would lead to significant destabilisation of the global oil market, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Ukraine’s military has claimed that Russian forces suffered “significant losses” in the southern region of Kherson following Kyiv’s counteroffensive launched earlier this week. Ukraine’s successes have been “quite convincing”, according to a spokesperson for the southern Ukrainian military command, who added that more “positive news” would likely follow “very soon”. Ukrainian troops have pushed back Russian forces at several points around Kherson, according to western officials. Officials estimate that about 20,000 Russian troops are in the pocket of the southern region, and caution that it is too soon to determine if Ukraine’s counterattack is working. The “physical integrity” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been “violated several times”, Rafael Grossi said. The IAEA chief said after leading the inspection team that while he would continue to worry about the plant, the situation was “more predictable” now. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of manipulating and distorting information shared with the IAEA. Ukrainian state-owned operator Energoatom said Russian officials “are making every effort to prevent the IAEA mission from getting to know the real state of affairs.

The taskforce, announced by Truss towards the beginning of her brief tenure as prime minister, was created as part of a package of measures announced in September to reform the “broken” market. Led by Madelaine McTernan, who had previously been in charge of the UK’s vaccine taskforce, the team aimed to agree long-term contracts with domestic and international suppliers to improve Britain’s energy security and cut charges. However, although Truss said the energy supply taskforce had already started negotiations in September, a government source has confirmed it was subsequently scrapped by Sunak. They said: “Winding down the taskforce is the right decision. While it was sensible in September for the previous administration to explore these contracts, locking in long-term contracts while gas prices are this high just doesn’t make sense.” Saying the taskforce was “one option on the table”, the source pointed to a “whole range of other actions” being taken in service of its aims, including financial backing for the new Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk. Truss said at the time that the consequences of Russia’s assault on Ukraine had exposed the “flaws” in the UK’s approach to energy security, and declared her intent to end “short-term thinking” on the issue “once and for all”. Other measures, announced as part of the energy bailout in September, included the “energy price guarantee”, which froze bills for an average household at £2,500 a year from 1 October. This will continue to protect bill-payers until the end of March 2024, despite the regulator Ofgem confirming last month that the annual price cap is due to rise to £4,279 in January 2023. A six-month scheme offering “equivalent support” for businesses and other non-domestic energy users was also announced at the time, with continuing assistance for “vulnerable industries” provided after the end of that period. A government spokesperson said: “The energy supply taskforce was set up in September 2022 as part of efforts to boost domestic energy security. “While the government is continuing these efforts and remains completely committed to strengthening our energy resilience, we have concluded that direct purchases of gas are not the best intervention in the market.” The Truss administration had said the taskforce and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) would also negotiate with renewable energy producers in an effort to cut their prices."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/02/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-updates-un-nuclear-team-zaporizhzhia-power-plant-moscow-warns-moldova-against-attack-latest","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-02T19:15:59Z","webTitle":"Russia says gas pipeline suspended indefinitely; G7 nations agree price cap for Russian oil – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/02/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-updates-un-nuclear-team-zaporizhzhia-power-plant-moscow-warns-moldova-against-attack-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/02/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-updates-un-nuclear-team-zaporizhzhia-power-plant-moscow-warns-moldova-against-attack-latest","fields":{"headline":"Russia says gas pipeline suspended indefinitely; G7 nations agree price cap for Russian oil – as it happened","bodyText":"The Russian energy giant Gazprom announced that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 will not restart on schedule on Saturday, citing damage to the turbine engine.

An expert team from the UN nuclear agency plan to stay at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after gaining long-awaited access to the site on Thursday. “We are not going anywhere.

Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of manipulating and distorting information shared with the IAEA.

It will not be any other way.” Ukraine’s military said it carried out strikes against Russian positions in the region around the southern town of Enerhodar near a nuclear power plant where U.N. experts are working, Reuters reports. The revelation by the armed forces’ general staff was unusual, since the military rarely gives details of specific targets. A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency is gathering data at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, on the edge of Russian-occupied Enerhodar. “It has been confirmed that in the region around the towns of Kherson and Enerhodar, precise strikes by our armed forces destroyed three enemy artillery systems as well as a warehouse with ammunition and up to a company of soldiers,” the general staff said in a Facebook post. Gazprom officials have already blamed sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine for the halting of gas deliveries to Europe. In a statement, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller indicated that Siemens could not perform repairs on the turbines damaged by the oil leak because of sanctions against the Russian state energy giant. “Siemens currently has almost no possibility to provide regular overhauls of our gas-pumping units. Siemens simply has nowhere to do this work,” Miller said, according to Interfax. Russia has asked for 56 visas from the United States to allow Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and his delegation to travel to New York for the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations this month, but so far has received none. In a letter to U.N. secretary general Antonio Guterres, seen by Reuters, Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said this was “alarming” because during the past several months Washington had “been constantly refusing to grant entry visas” to a number of Russian delegates for other U.N. events. The United States takes seriously its obligations as U.N. host country, said a State Department spokesperson, adding that visa records are confidential under U.S. law so it could not comment on individual cases. On Tuesday, Grossi says he will be briefing the UN Security Council on the findings from their visit. And that concludes the press conference from Vienna. Grossi says the IAEA is planning a bigger safety structure for the plant. Grossi says he does not want to compare the situation at the plant to other examples such as Chernobyl. Grossi says the military presence were not available when he asked to speak to them about the control centre, they did not approach his team, and they were “withdrawn” throughout their visit. Grossi says he hopes the IAEA does not have to be a constant presence there and the day comes when the plant is operating normally and inspectors and experts can visit occasionally. Grossi says the IAEA will not be “manipulated” by any member states and does not listen to external noise. Grossi reiterates that international inspectors being there and reporting back 24/7 could be a “stabilising factor” in terms of the safety and security of the plant. The IAEA chief adds another crisis centre has been set up at the plant. He adds that everything that he requested to be seen was inspected. Grossi says he would never send a person to a place that he would not go to first. He adds his team on the ground at the Zaporizhzhia plant are in constant communication with him. Grossi says the military operations are increasing in the region of the plant “which worries me a lot”. He says the statistical probability of further physical damage to the plant therefore is high since shelling began there in August. Grossi reiterates the plant is operating and there is a professional dynamic between the nuclear experts. He says it is “admirable” for the Ukraine experts to continue to work there under the circumstances but admits there is “a tension” due to the war. Grossi says the team will produce a report early next week of their findings. Grossi describes the situation as “extremely complex and challenging” which needs the permanent support of the IAEA. Grossi, whose team landed back in Vienna a few minutes ago, said there are no major problems logistically and a “mixed bag” with the systems. On the outside power supply, Grossi says on several occasions there were blackouts and interruptions of the supply to the outside. On the safety and security systems, Grossi says it is not fully functioning but not in the critical red zone. Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says they saw miulitary activity around the plant and markings on buildings so the “physical integirty of the facilities has been violated several times” which he brands unacceptable. Grossi, who completed a first tour of the key areas of the Russian-occupied power plant, begins by saying six of the experts remain at the site to continue with the work. The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, is due to give a press conference shortly in Vienna after returning from the Zaporizhzhia plant. We’ll be providing updates from it here. Joe Biden will request $11.7bn (£10.2bn) in emergency funding from Congress to provide lethal aid and budget support to Ukraine, the White House has said. The emergency funding request will also include $2bn (£1.7bn) to address the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine on US energy supplies, according to Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In a statement on Telegram, Gazprom shared what it said was a picture showing leaked oil on equipment at the compressor station. From Reuters’ Felix Light: Here’s more on Gazprom’s announcement that the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline to Germany will not be restarted as planned tomorrow. The Russian state energy company said the decision to keep the Baltic Sea pipeline shut was due to an oil leak detected at the Portovaya compressor station near St Petersburg. Gazprom has now said it needs to fix the problem before the flows can restart, with no indication of how long that may take. Similar oil leaks have previously been detected at some other turbines, which are out of action now, and “complete elimination of oil leakage on these turbines is possible only in the conditions of a specialised repair company,” Gazprom said. The pipeline was due to reopen on Saturday following a three-day break, after the company cited the need to carry out repairs in a move that heightened already acute nervousness over the reliability of winter energy supplies. Nord Stream 1, which runs under the Baltic Sea to supply Germany and others, was running at 20% capacity even before flows were halted this week. As the Guardian’s diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour writes, the latest move is a brutal show of force by Russia and comes after G7 countries agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil earlier today. The Russian energy giant Gazprom has announced that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 will not restart on schedule on Saturday, citing damage to the turbine engine. In a statement, the company did not give a time frame for restarting the pipeline, claiming it detected an oil leak at the main gas turbine at Portovaya compressor station near St Petersburg. It said the turbine could not operate safely until the leak was repaired. Ukraine declared this week it had begun a counteroffensive aiming to retake Kherson – the one city Russia holds west of the Dnieper river – prompting a fog of uncertainty to descend on how the effort was progressing, never mind whether it would succeed. Oleksiy Arestovych, a key adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, stressed there would be “no quick wins” as the attack in the south began – a point reflected in a briefing on Friday by western officials. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the officials said Ukraine had “pushed back” the Russian defenders in “several places”, but insisted it was too soon to name villages taken or distances gained while fighting was ongoing. The caution may be realistic, but it is also telling. This is not, in any sense, a blitzkrieg or a broad front attack, but rather a localised effort to strike at the most obvious strategic vulnerability in the Russian frontline, and to try to demonstrate that Ukraine can drive the Russians back in places before winter sets in. It is a struggle about Kyiv’s ability to act proactively as much as it is about recapturing the occupied city itself. Read Dan Sabbagh’s full analysis: Push to retake Kherson is symbol of Ukraine’s cautious confidence A woman from eastern Ukraine has been detained after she was accused of sending the locations of her soldier husband’s unit to Russian military intelligence, according to Ukraine’s state security service. The 31-year-old unnamed woman from the Dnipropetrovsk region passed on information about the locations of military buildings and equipment along frontline positions in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions, it said in a statement. The agency said the woman would question her husband about the location of his unit and other Ukrainian formations on the frontline. She would then pass on the information “through messenger applications to Russian military intelligence, where it was used for artillery and airstrikes”, it said. The statement continued: She took this step despite the fact that she is married to a serviceman of the armed forces of Ukraine, and that they have a son together. The G7 countries have agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil in an attempt to stem the flow of funds into the Kremlin’s war coffers. Finance ministers from the UK, US, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada have agreed a plan to put a ceiling on Russian oil prices. The proposal would mean importers seeking shipping services and insurance cover from companies based in G7 and EU countries would need to adhere to a price cap to transport Russian oil. The cap is expected to be introduced at the same time as planned EU embargoes on Russian oil kick in – on 5 December for crude and 5 February for refined products, such as diesel. The level of the cap is still being discussed. UK chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the decision followed a meeting earlier this week with US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen in Washington. Yellen said the measure would be implemented “in the weeks to come” and represents a “major blow for Russian finances and will hinder Russia’s ability to fight its unprovoked war in Ukraine”.

The agreement by G7 finance ministers to impose a price cap on Russian oil will “curtail Putin’s capacity to fund his war” in Ukraine, Britain’s chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said. In a statement, Zahawi said further action against Putin was a “personal priority as Chancellor”. Zahawi said: Since Putin’s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the UK and our allies have imposed hugely damaging sanctions on the Kremlin war machine, pushing the Russian economy into a deep recession and putting the majority of Russia’s 640 billion dollars foreign exchange reserves beyond use. He added: We will curtail Putin’s capacity to fund his war from oil exports by banning services, such as insurance and the provision of finance, to vessels carrying Russian oil above an agreed price cap. We are united against this barbaric aggression and will do all we can to support Ukraine as they fight for sovereignty, democracy and freedom. Finance ministers from the Group of Seven advanced nations have agreed they will “urgently” move towards imposing a price cap on Russian oil imports, aimed at stopping Moscow from raking in huge profits from soaring energy prices. In a statement, G7 ministers said they would “urgently work on the finalisation and implementation” of the measure but left out key details of the plan. They confirmed their commitment to the plan after a virtual meeting but said the per-barrel level of the price cap would be determined later “based on a range of technical inputs” to be agreed by the coalition of countries. The G7 ministers said: Today we confirm our joint political intention to finalise and implement a comprehensive prohibition of services which enable maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally. The price cap is is “specifically designed” to reduce “Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression whilst limiting the impact of Russia’s war on global energy prices, particularly for low and middle-income countries”, they said. The G7 consists of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Ukraine’s agriculture ministry has said grain exports are down 54.5% year-on-year in 2022-23 season so far, at 4.16m tonnes, Reuters reports. The country’s grain exports have slumped since the start of the war because its Black Sea ports, a key route for shipments, were closed off. Three ports were unblocked at the end of July under a deal between Moscow and Kyiv, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. The government has said Ukraine could harvest at least 50m tonnes of grain this year, compared with a record 86m tonnes in 2021, because of the loss of land to Russian forces and lower grain yields. Janet Yellen, the US treasury secretary, has said that a G7 price cap on Russian oil would help fight inflation while delivering a blow to Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine. The price cap helps achieve “our dual goals of putting downward pressure on global energy prices while denying Putin revenue to fund his brutal war in Ukraine”, Yellen said in a statement. Reuters reports that Japanese finance minister Shunichi Suzuki has also said he welcomed a G7 deal, and that it should be implemented quickly. Energoatom, the Ukrainian operator of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), has posted to Telegram to say that reactor number five, which was shut down yesterday as an emergency precaution following shelling in the vicinity, has begun operating again. The statement said: Power unit number five of the ZNPP, which was shut down yesterday morning as a result of another mortar shelling by the Russian occupying forces at the ZNPP site, was connected to the power grid at 1.10pm, and capacity is being added. Currently, two power units are operating at the station, which produce electricity for the needs of Ukraine. There are no comments on the operation of equipment and security systems. We will remind you that representatives of the IAEA mission continue their work at the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian troops have pushed back Russian forces at several points around Kherson since Kyiv launched its long-awaited counteroffensive aiming to retake the southern province, according to western officials. Officials estimate that about 20,000 Russian troops are in the pocket of the southern region, and caution that it is too soon to determine if Ukraine’s counterattack is working. G7 finance ministers are expected to firm up plans on Friday to impose a price cap on Russian oil aimed at slashing revenues for Moscow’s war in Ukraine but keeping crude flowing to avoid price rises, officials said. The ministers from the club of wealthy industrial democracies are due to meet virtually and are likely to issue a communique that lays out their implementation plans. “A deal is likely,” a European G7 official said, adding that it was unclear how much detail would be revealed, such as the per-barrel level of the price cap, above which complying countries would refuse insurance and finance to Russian crude and oil product cargoes. Read the full story here. Russian forces are suffering “heavy losses” in the face of Ukrainian resistance that has stalled Moscow’s advance and demonstrated the determination of the Ukrainian people to “retake their sovereign territory”, the UK’s national security adviser, Stephen Lovegrove, has said. In a statement, Lovegrove said Britain will continue to provide Ukraine with humanitarian, economic and military assistance and that its support “will not waver”. Ukraine’s resistance “has inspired the world and shown huge courage in the face of brutality”, he said. Lovegrove said: Now that courageous resistance has stalled the Russian advance and demonstrated the determination of the Ukrainian people and armed forces to retake their sovereign territory. He added: The risks around this terrible conflict continue as Putin finds he can’t make progress, his forces suffer heavy losses, and sanctions continue to degrade his war machine and take money out of the pockets of Russia’s richest people. At the same time Russia is trying and failing to impose a veneer of legitimacy on the areas it temporarily controls, including through plans for staged sham referenda. It will not succeed. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has responded to comments by the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, about putting a ceiling on the price Europe pays for Russian gas. Russia will simply turn off gas supply to Europe if Brussels pushes ahead with a price cap on Russian gas, Medvedev wrote on Telegram. The Kremlin has warned it will stop selling oil to countries that impose price caps on Russia’s energy resources. Finance ministers from the Group of Seven are expected to firm up plans today to impose a price cap on Russian oil aimed at slashing revenues for Moscow’s war in Ukraine. The ministers from the club of wealthy industrial democracies are due to meet virtually, and could issue a communique that lays out their implementation plans. If G7 leaders decide to impose price caps on Russian oil, it will lead to significant destabilisation of the global oil market, the Kremlin said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters today: Companies that impose a price cap will not be among the recipients of Russian oil. We simply will not cooperate with them on non-market principles. He added: One thing can be said with confidence: such a move will lead to a significant destabilisation of the oil markets. Peskov’s comments came as the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said it was time for the EU to consider a similar price cap on Russian gas purchases. Such a cap would help fight back against Vladimir Putin’s attempts to manipulate the European energy market, Von der Leyen said. World food prices have fallen for a fifth consecutive month, partly due to the resumption of exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, according to the UN. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) food price index, which tracks the monthly change in international prices of a basket of food commodities, reached an all-time high in March after Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. Since then, the FAO index has been falling steadily, declining by 1.9% in August. Vegetable oils fell by 3.3% in August, below their level a year ago. Cereals dropped by 1.4%, driven by a 5.1% drop in international wheat prices. It came off the back of “improved production prospects in North America and Russia as well as the resumption of exports from the Black Sea ports in Ukraine for the first time in over five months of interruption”, the FAO said. Ukraine’s military has claimed that Russian forces suffered “significant losses” in the southern region of Kherson following Kyiv’s counteroffensive launched earlier this week. Ukraine’s successes have been “quite convincing”, according to Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for the southern Ukrainian military command. Humeniuk said: The enemy suffers quite significant losses — losses in manpower have gone from tens to hundreds. Equipment also burns. More “positive news” will likely follow “very soon”, she added: We continue to destroy the enemy in terms of its logistics, capabilities, capacities. Ammunition warehouses explode, pontoon crossings explode. It means that the enemy’s logistics and transport connections are undermined to such an extent that they cannot raise reserves. Operational Command South claimed that a range of targets had been struck, including a ferry crossing. Moscow has denied reports of Ukrainian progress and said its troops had routed Ukrainian forces. The Guardian could not independently verify either side’s claims. Hello everyone.

An expert team from the United Nations nuclear agency plan to stay at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) after gaining long-awaited access to the site on Thursday. “We are not going anywhere. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving – it’s going to stay there,” the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, told reporters after returning to Ukrainian-held territory. He said a group of experts had stayed behind at the plant in south-eastern Ukraine and would provide an impartial, neutral and technically sound assessment of the situation. The physical integrity of the Zaporizhzhia plant had been violated on several occasions, Rafael Grossi said. “It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” he told reporters. “I worried, I worry and I will continue to be worried about the plant until we have a situation which is more stable, which is more predictable.” Russia’s ambassador to international institutions in Vienna told the RIA Novosti news agency Friday that two inspectors would remain permanently at the plant. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of manipulating and distorting information shared with the IAEA. Ukrainian state-owned operator Energoatom said in a statement that Russian officials “are making every effort to prevent the IAEA mission from getting to know the real state of affairs. They spread manipulative and false information about this visit.” Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu accused Ukraine on Friday of “nuclear terrorism”. Russia has occupied Europe’s largest nuclear power plant since March. Pro-Russian proxy authorities in Zaporizhzhia have accused Kyiv of trying to smuggle “spies” into the IAEA inspection team posing as journalists. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Friday “We did everything to ensure that IAEA would get access to the ZNPP and I believe that this mission may still have a role to play. Unfortunately we haven’t heard the main thing from the IAEA which is the call for Russia to demilitarise the station.” The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, has restated the expansionist military aims of Russia’s invasion, saying “Our task is to liberate all Russian cities that were founded by Russian people during the time of the Russian Empire, and developed during the Soviet Union thanks to the help of our entire vast country. And this is not only the territories of Novorossia [the Donbas], but also much wider. It will not be any other way.” The general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said in its daily operation briefing that the main military aim of Russia at the moment continues to be “establishing full control over the territory of Donetsk region and maintaining the occupied areas of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions”. Russia’s foreign minister warned Moldova Thursday that any actions seen as endangering the security of Russian troops in the breakaway region of Transnistria would be considered an attack on Russia. Sergei Lavrov said: “Everyone should understand that any action that would threaten the security of our troops [in Transnistria] would be considered under international law as an attack on Russia.” Russia and China launched large-scale military exercises involving several allied nations on Thursday, in a show of growing defence cooperation between Moscow and Beijing and a demonstration of Moscow’s military might. The Russian defence ministry said the Vostok 2022 (East 2022) exercise would be held until Wednesday in Russia’s far east and the Sea of Japan and involve more than 50,000 troops and 5,000 weapons units, including 140 aircraft and 60 warships. US federal agents searched properties linked to a billionaire Russian oligarch in Manhattan, the Hamptons and an exclusive Miami island on Thursday. FBI agents and Homeland Security Investigations personnel searched the properties, linked to Viktor Vekselberg, who is a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and whose $120m yacht was seized in April, NBC News reported. Germany’s domestic intelligence agency is investigating allegations that two senior civil servants could have been spying for Russia, according to a local media reports on Thursday. Die Zeit, which first revealed the case, said the officials being investigated had close involvement with energy supply issues and held key positions. Children returned to Ukrainian schools trashed by occupying Russian forces on Thursday. Only schools that are fit for use, are in areas that do not face a regular threat of shelling and that have enough students opt for in-person teaching will reopen. School administrations have been preparing for the new academic year by outfitting basements as shelters and training teachers on what to do in case of an attack. Over the last couple of days, the main story of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been the inspection of the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) by a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). If you missed it, yesterday we published this video report from on the ground in Nikopol, the city that lies across the river from the ZNPP, and which is being regularly fired upon by Russian forces. The residents live in fear of a nuclear accident. Luke Harding and Christopher Cherry spoke to some of them the morning after yet another Russian attack. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has posted a series of images on Telegram that he states illustrate the overnight destruction of a sports facility in Kharkiv. He writes: The occupiers have once again struck the peaceful infrastructure of Kharkiv. Around midnight the Russians destroyed the premises of the Lokomotiv sports complex named after H Kirpa with S-300 missile strikes. This is the world sports arena, where our champions in synchronised swimming trained. World stars from various sports, medalists of the Olympic Games performed in these walls. The swimming pool, the modern boxing club, which was inaugurated only in February of this year, were destroyed. The Russians are once again committing terror against the civilian population. The Russian defence ministry has issued some images of the inspection being carried out at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) yesterday. It includes images purporting to show fallen munitions in the grounds of the ZNPP. Russian news agencies are reporting that defence minister Sergei Shoigu has said Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). They report that Shoigu accused Ukraine of “nuclear terrorism”. Russian forces have occupied Europe’s largest nuclear power plant since March. In another development, the RIA news agency is quoting Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russian-imposed administration in Zaporizhzhia accusing Kyiv of trying to infiltrate the IAEA mission with what he described as “spies”. Offering no evidence for the accusation, it quotes him saying “Ukrainian special services, on the orders of Zelenskiy, tried to introduce their spies and saboteurs working under journalistic cover into the IAEA delegation to the ZNPP. An attempt to infiltrate spies and saboteurs under the guise of Ukrainian journalists was stopped. They were not allowed into the territory.” Earlier today the Ukrainian operator of the plant, Energoatom, complained that journalists had been prevented from accompanying the UN inspection team, writing: The vast majority of “media from the rest of the world” who arrived at the power plant yesterday are Russian propagandists. Buses with Ukrainian and foreign journalists who tried to get to the ZNPP along with IAEA mission via the territory of Ukraine were not passed through the checkpoint by the Russian military. Additionally, Energoatom claimed that “The invaders deliberately blocked cellular communications and the internet in Enerhodar in order to prevent the forwarding of pictures and videos from ZNPP and its satellite city.” None of these claims have been independently verified. Reuters is reporting that two inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will stay at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on a permanent basis, according to a statement from Russia’s ambassador to international institutions in Vienna to the RIA Novosti news agency. More details soon … The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has been quoted on one of the DPR’s Telegram channels speaking again about the military expansion plans of the pro-Russian forces occupying Ukraine. The channel quotes Denis Pushilin speaking as part of what it describes as a “federal education marathon”. Pushilin says: Our task is to liberate all Russian cities that were founded by Russian people during the time of the Russian Empire, and developed during the Soviet Union thanks to the help of our entire vast country. And this is not only the territories of Novorossia, but also much wider. We still have a lot to do, and in what form they will return home, we will see, moreover, we will participate in this. It will not be any other way. Novorossia was a proposed confederation between the DPR and the similarly self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) in the east of Ukraine whose formation stalled in 2015. The term Novorossiya has also historically referred to an area of southern Ukraine on the Black Sea coast stretching from the Donbas in the east to the border with Moldova in the west, incorporating Odesa and going as far north as Dnipro. The DPR and LPR are only recognised as legitimate authorities by three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has spoken again about the IAEA visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in a video streamed to a meeting in Italy. Reuters quotes him saying: We did everything to ensure that IAEA would get access to the ZNPP and I believe that this mission may still have a role to play. Unfortunately we haven’t heard the main thing from the IAEA which is the call for Russia to demilitarise the station. I hope the mission will comply with what we’ve agreed and that it will serve the interests of the entire international community. Zelenskiy also said that ensuring the ZNPP returns to operating safely and remains connected to the country’s power grid would help his country act to counter Europe’s energy crisis. Ukraine’s president was addressing the European House, Ambrosetti Forum meeting in Cernobbio. In its daily operational briefing, the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine has said that Russia’s current main aim remains to seize full control of Donetsk. It writes: The opponent continues to focus efforts on establishing full control over the territory of Donetsk region and maintaining the occupied areas of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. The enemy launches air and missile strikes at military and civilian objects in the territory of our State. In the Donetsk direction, the enemy’s main efforts are focused on conducting offensive actions on the Bakhmut and Avdiivka directions. In a separate post on Facebook, the Ukrainian armed forces has updated the total casualty count, claiming to have killed a further 350 pro-Russian service personnel in the last 24 hours and to have inflicted a total loss of 48,700 people on the occupying forces. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, the region bordering Kherson in southern Ukraine, has detailed the overnight incidents in a status update on Telegram. He lists a large number of villages that came under sporadic fire in the last 24 hours, but states that while a small number of buildings and commercial premises were damaged, only one injury has been recorded. Russian news agency Tass is carrying a quote from Alexander Volga, head of the Russian-imposed occupation administration of Enerhodar, the city where the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) is located. It reports he said on Russian television that eight people from the IAEA mission remain at the ZNPP, alongside four more people, who he described as service personnel who accompany them through their activities. Energoatom, the Ukrainian operator of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), has this morning republished on its Telegram channel some overnight quotes from Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko. He told Ukrainian television: The IAEA mission must state that the presence of the military, the presence of weapons at the station, is a real threat to nuclear safety. This is obvious. This mission is unique because there are no analogues in the history of the IAEA at all. Missions took place at objects that were controlled by states. But there was no such mission format as it is now. Recommendations and reports of the IAEA should be sent to Ukraine and Energoatom. And we must implement these recommendations, and eliminate the consequences of the barbaric actions of the occupiers. But for that we need to have access to the station. It should be returned under the control of Ukraine. Oleh Synyehubov, Ukraine’s governor of Kharkiv, has posted to Telegram this morning to say that overnight rocket attacks took place in his region on the Kholodnohirskyi district of Kharkiv. He also listed five other areas that had seen artillery fire, and gave a casualty list of three women being hospitalised in Izyum, and a 63-year-old man being killed in Kharkiv. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam in London. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Requests for gas on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Europe are up for early 3 September, the operator’s website reportedly showed on Thursday. Gas nominations were at 14,437,507 kilowatt hours per hour (kwh/h) from 2-3am CET for 3 September, Reuters reported the website as showing. The news agency described nominations as essentially capacity requests for gas transport and can be changed by the supplier when needed. When they are changed they are described as renominations, but those can also still be changed. Gazprom this week said that a three-day maintenance of the Portovaya compressor station would last from 31 August, 1am GMT (3am CET) until 3 September, 1am GMT (3am CET). Heavy fighting continues in southern Ukraine, including shelling in Enerhodar district, near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. The ministry also offered a scathing observation of Moscow’s “Vostok 22” annual military exercises it commenced on Thursday. “Russia publicly claimed that 50,000 troops will take part, however, it’s unlikely that more than 15,000 personnel will be actively involved this year,” the latest British intelligence report reads. “This is around 20% of the forces which participated in the last Vostok exercise in 2018.” Russia’s military strategic exercises, such as Vostok, are “heavily scripted, do not encourage initiative, and primarily aim to impress Russian leaders and international audiences” while failing to sustain the military’s ability to conduct large scale, complex operations, the ministry added. Russian officials at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station are manipulating and distorting information shared with IAEA officials, Ukrainian officials have said. Ukrainian state owned operator Energoatom said Russian officials “are making every effort to prevent the International Atomic Energy Agency mission from getting to know the real state of affairs” at the Russian-held power plant. “They spread manipulative and false information about this visit,” the company added in a statement shared to its Telegram channel this morning. An employee spoke with Ukrainian media outlet Suspilny on condition of anonymity: They led Grossi and the inspectors along their route, showed them ‘arrival maps’ and brought local collaborators to them with statements from ‘indifferent citizens’ about the need to stop the shelling. It was a circus,” said the ZNPP employee. According to the employee, the Russians convinced the representatives of the mission that radiological, chemical and biological protection troops, and not combat units of the Russian army, were at the station. Russia’s foreign minister has warned that any actions seen as endangering a Russian peacekeeping contingent in a separatist region of Moldova would be considered as an attack on Russia itself. Sergei Lavrov’s statement in an address at Russia’s top foreign affairs school on on Thursday underlined concerns that Moldova’s Transnistria region, which borders Ukraine, could be drawn into the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Russia has stationed peacekeepers there since a three-month war in 1992 that left Transnistria outside Moldovan control. Russian forces also guard a large ammunition dump in the region. In April, tensions in Moldova soared after a series of explosions in Transnistria. Everyone should understand that any kind of actions that will raise a threat to the security of our servicemen will be considered in accordance with international law as an attack on the Russian Federation,” Lavrov said. After Lavrov’s comments, Moldova’s foreign ministry summoned Russia’s charge d’affaires for “clarification”. We remind the Russian side that the legislation of the Republic of Moldova guarantees fundamental human rights and freedoms,” the ministry said. The “physical integrity” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southern Ukraine has been “violated”, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said, as he voiced his fears for the site. Rafael Grossi led a team of inspectors to the Russian-controlled plant that has been frequently shelled in recent weeks, raising fears of a nuclear incident. “It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” Grossi told reporters after he returned with part of his team to the Ukrainian-controlled area on Thursday. “I worried, I worry and I will continue to be worried about the plant,” he said, while adding that the situation was “more predictable” now. The UN nuclear agency chief said his experts were staying put after they crossed on Thursday into Russian-held territory in Ukraine and reached Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, where both sides warn of potential catastrophe. An International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection team braved intense shelling to reach the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, arriving after a delay of several hours in a large convoy with a heavy presence of Russian soldiers nearby. We are not going anywhere. The IAEA is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving. It’s going to stay there,” IAEA head Rafael Grossi, who personally led the mission, told reporters after returning to Ukrainian-held territory. He said a group of IAEA experts had stayed behind at the plant and would provide an impartial, neutral and technically sound assessment of the situation. I worried, I worry and I will continue to be worried about the plant until we have a situation which is more stable, which is more predictable,” he said. Ukraine and Russia accuse each other of creating a risk of a Chernobyl-like disaster by shelling near the plant, where the situation has been unravelling in recent weeks. Russia seized the plant early in the now more than six-month-old war. Kyiv also accuses Russia of using the facility to shield its forces, and of planning to steal its output by hooking it up to the Russian power grid. Moscow denies this but has so far rejected international calls to withdraw its troops from the plant. Video footage released by Russia’s state news agency RIA showed IAEA inspectors, including Grossi, wearing safety helmets and being shown around the site by Russian energy officials, who pointed out what were described as damaged water pipes. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will stay at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after agency chief Rafael Grossi warned that the physical integrity of the plant had been violated on several occasions. It is 7.30am in Kyiv. Here is where things stand: An expert team from the United Nations nuclear agency plan to stay at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after gaining long-awaited access to the site on Thursday. “We are not going anywhere.

Die Zeit, which first revealed the case, said the officials being investigated had close involvement with energy supply issues and held key positions. A senior Russian oil executive has died after falling from the window of a Moscow hospital, months after his company criticised the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ravil Maganov, the chair of Lukoil, Russia’s largest private oil company, “fell from a window at Central clinical hospital”, the Interfax news agency reported on Thursday, citing a source. “He died from injuries sustained.” Maganov is the second top Lukoil executive to die in mysterious circumstances in recent months. Children returned to Ukrainian schools trashed by occupying Russian forces on Thursday. Only schools that are fit for use, are in areas that do not face a regular threat of shelling and that have enough students opt for in-person teaching will reopen. School administrations have been preparing for the new academic year by outfitting basements as shelters and training teachers on what to do in case of an attack. All children who attend are told to carry an emergency bag with a change of clothes, any medicine they may need, a note from their parents and, for the younger children, a favourite toy. Russian forces have been forcibly transferring Ukrainian civilians to Russia or areas of Ukraine under their control, according to Human Rights Watch. Forced transfers were “a serious violation of the laws of war that constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity”, it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/13/uk-ministers-floats-plan-for-hydrogen-ready-domestic-boilers-from-2026","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T13:03:16Z","webTitle":"UK ministers float plan for ‘hydrogen-ready’ domestic boilers from 2026","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/13/uk-ministers-floats-plan-for-hydrogen-ready-domestic-boilers-from-2026","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/13/uk-ministers-floats-plan-for-hydrogen-ready-domestic-boilers-from-2026","fields":{"headline":"UK ministers float plan for ‘hydrogen-ready’ domestic boilers from 2026","bodyText":"Ministers are considering requiring that all new domestic boilers be “hydrogen-ready” from 2026, as they announced £100m for nuclear and hydrogen projects. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has launched a consultation on improving boiler standards, and has argued there is a strong case for introducing hydrogen-ready boilers in the UK from 2026. The government is examining options to replace polluting fossil fuel gas in Britain’s energy system and has offered grants for households to install heat pumps. A ban on gas boilers in new homes comes into force in 2025, although uncertainty remains over the timeframe for the phase-out of fossil gas in existing homes. Hydrogen-ready boilers are initially installed to burn fossil gas but then can be easily converted to operate on hydrogen by an engineer. The consultation document argues that the strategy will reduce “the costs associated with scrapping natural gas-only boilers before the end of their useful life”. “Mandating hydrogen-ready boilers will give industry the confidence to prepare supply chains to ensure the benefits of the potential transition are maximised,” officials said. However, they cautioned that there is no guarantee that boilers will ultimately be converted to run on hydrogen. While hydrogen is expected to play a significant role in the decarbonisation of heavy industry and the transport network, opinion is split on the practicality of using it in Britain’s gas network and the resulting cost to households. Plans for a pilot to examine the effectiveness of using hydrogen have met local opposition in Whitby, outside Ellesmere Port, where residents have expressed concerns over becoming “lab rats”. The consultation, which closes in late March, will also examine the cost of hydrogen-ready boilers. “The government needs confidence that consumers will not face a premium for their purchase,” it said. Separately on Tuesday, the government announced £77m of funding to aid nuclear fuel production and develop nuclear reactors, and £25m for technologies that can produce hydrogen from sustainable biomass and waste, while removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Late last month, the government committed £700m to the Sizewell C nuclear power station project in Suffolk. A search for further investors into the development, which is led by France’s EDF, is ongoing. The funding includes up to £60m for the next phase of research into high temperature gas reactors, with a target of using them by the early 2030s. The energy and climate minister, Graham Stuart, said: “This funding package will strengthen our energy security, by ensuring we have a safe and secure supply of domestic nuclear fuel services, while also creating more UK jobs and export opportunities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/apr/07/what-is-boris-johnson-energy-plan-and-what-is-it-missing","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-07T17:18:38Z","webTitle":"What is Boris Johnson’s energy plan, and what is it missing?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/07/what-is-boris-johnson-energy-plan-and-what-is-it-missing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/apr/07/what-is-boris-johnson-energy-plan-and-what-is-it-missing","fields":{"headline":"What is Boris Johnson’s energy plan, and what is it missing?","bodyText":"Boris Johnson claimed on Thursday that his energy security strategy had delivered “clean, affordable, secure power to the people for generations to come”. In comments issued as he launched the policy at Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in Somerset and put atomic energy front and centre of his plan, the prime minister said his government was the first for years that had not “dodged the big decisions on energy”. Yet within hours, critics spoke of a lack of ambition, particularly around onshore wind and energy efficiency, avenues that experts say offer the best and quickest hope of bringing down bills and achieving energy self-sufficiency. So what exactly is in the plan and what is missing from it? Nuclear Peak winter electricity demand is about 60 gigawatts and National Grid expects that to be 85GW by 2050, as vehicles and home heating are increasingly electrified, with a safety buffer needed on top of that. Johnson has set a target of 25% of electricity coming from nuclear. That means increasing capacity from 7GW to 24GW by 2050, an effort to be overseen by a new body, Great British Nuclear. The first phase will involve eight new nuclear reactors, equivalent to four 3GW power stations. Sizewell C is set for approval within this parliamentary term. Two more will follow in the next, with Wylfa on Anglesey the front-runner. After that, projects could be located at approved sites such as Oldbury in Gloucestershire and Moorside (Sellafield) in Cumbria. Small nuclear reactors of nearly 0.5GW each will be part of the mix, with both Rolls-Royce and GE Hitachi working on projects. The recently approved “regulated asset base” funding model will transfer risk to the taxpayer, allaying risk-aversion among private firms, which has stymied recent development. Ministers have not ruled out taking a stake in individual plants. There will, however, be no nuclear power plants in Scotland, whose parliament has reaffirmed its opposition. Wind “We will be the Saudi Arabia of wind power,” the government claims. Offshore wind targets have been scaled up, from 40GW to 50GW, with planning reforms intended to cut delivery times, which can be up to 13 years. But Tory infighting has turned onshore into a sore point. A leaked version of the energy plan, first reported by the i newspaper, include a target of 45GW by 2035, up from nearly 15GW now. That disappeared in the final document, after anti-wind Tory MPs refused to countenance overhauling planning laws that make onshore all but impossible to develop in England. The government says it will look at offering local communities cheaper electricity bills in return for their consent but will not rip up those obstructive planning rules. No such prohibition exists in Scotland, which is better suited to onshore than England thanks to greater wind speeds and more remote locations. In a TV clip at Hinkley Point C, Johnson said onshore turbines were “controversial with people”. “People feel that they affect the beauty of the countryside, I totally understand that.” However, polling by YouGov in 2021 shows two thirds of people support onshore wind projects, even in rural areas. Solar Solar is in line for one of the biggest expansions. The plan envisages a fivefold increase that could take the total capacity from 14GW to 70GW by 2035. Unlike onshore wind, this could be underpinned by planning reform that favours development on non-protected sites. Energy efficiency The energy security plan contains no major new investment in upgrading leaky homes to make them easier and cheaper to heat, despite the price of gas – the heat source for 90% of homes – hitting historic highs. As recently as 2012, the UK was upgrading 2.3m homes a year thanks to government funding that was cut when David Cameron vowed to eliminate “green crap”, slowing the rate to a trickle. The energy security plan offers very little to reignite that drive to insulate the UK, enraging environmental groups. Oil and gas The government’s renewable proposals have been accompanied by firmer support for oil and gas, further inflaming the ire of environmentalists. North Sea drillers will be encouraged to seek new licences, although the government hasn’t quantified what impact it expects this to have on production. Having banned fracking in 2019, the government will commission an “impartial” review by the British Geological Survey into whether it can be done safely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-ukraines-forces-launch-attacks-in-occupied-kherson-un-nuclear-team-arrives-in-kyiv-live-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-30T18:00:16Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kremlin-appointed Kherson leader reportedly flees to Russia; first grain ship docks in Africa – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-ukraines-forces-launch-attacks-in-occupied-kherson-un-nuclear-team-arrives-in-kyiv-live-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-ukraines-forces-launch-attacks-in-occupied-kherson-un-nuclear-team-arrives-in-kyiv-live-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kremlin-appointed Kherson leader reportedly flees to Russia; first grain ship docks in Africa – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Russian soldiers to flee for their lives after his forces launched an offensive to retake southern Ukraine. A senior presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, cautioned Ukrainians not to expect rapid gains and described the offensive as a “slow operation to grind the enemy”. The former head of Britain’s secret intelligence service, MI6, has welcomed Ukraine’s counterattacks in Kherson, saying it is a key moment in the war. Sir Alex Younger told the BBC that the fightback from Kyiv showed the two opposing forces had “reached some kind of balance, which is an unexpected and frankly welcome situation”. The Kremlin has insisted that its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine is going to plan despite the news that Kyiv’s troops have launched a long-awaited counteroffensive in the south of the country. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “The special military operation continues, it continues methodically, and in coordination with the current plans. All objectives will be fulfilled.” A Moscow-installed leader of occupied Kherson has reportedly fled to Russia after Kyiv announced it had begun its long-awaited counterattack aimed at taking back the southern region from Russian forces. When asked by the Guardian about his location, Kirill Stremousov said he was currently “travelling around Russian cities, meeting different people for work”. At least four people were killed and four wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv, the regional governor said. Writing on the Telegram messaging app, Oleh Synehubov said: “As a result of the shelling of the central part of Kharkiv, at least four people died and four more were injured.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has met the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, and his delegation ahead of the group’s visit to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. A key adviser to Ukraine’s president accused Russian forces of deliberately shelling corridors for the IAEA inspectors to force them through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. The European Commission has said it will donate 5.5m potassium iodide tablets to Ukraine amid fears that fighting in the area of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant could lead to nuclear catastrophe. The commission said it had received a request from the Ukrainian government for potassium iodide tablets “as a preventative safety measure” to increase the level of protection around the nuclear plant. The first shipment of grain from Ukraine to the drought-stricken Horn of Africa since the war began has docked in Djibouti. The UN-chartered vessel Brave Commander is carrying 23,000 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat and will soon be followed by another carrying 7,000 tonnes. The total shipment, which will be unloaded in Djibouti and transported to Ethiopia, is enough to feed 1.5m people for a month. Ukraine has deployed a fleet of dummy rockets to trick Russian forces into wasting expensive long-range missiles on pointless targets, according to reports. At least 10 Russian cruise missiles have reportedly been fired by Moscow’s naval fleet in the Black Sea at the dummy targets, which are made of wood but look like US-supplied advanced rocket launcher systems when spotted by Russian drones, the Washington Post reports. Germany and France have issued a joint warning against a ban on tourist visas for Russians, saying such a step would be counter-productive. The split on tourist visas will be at the heart of a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers in Prague on Tuesday and Wednesday as they discuss what further steps they can take to sanction Russia for its six-month old invasion of Ukraine. The UN’s cultural agency has said it supports a bid by Ukraine to put its port city of Odesa on the Unesco world heritage list of protected sites. The UN agency also said it wants to add Odesa, Kyiv and Lviv to the list of world heritage sites “in danger”. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thanks for following along. I’ll be back tomorrow. Here’s more on the meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, in Kyiv today. Grossi arrived in the Ukrainian capital late on Monday at the head of a 14-strong team before a visit to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Zelenskiy said the mission was “probably one of the top-priority questions regarding the safety of Ukraine and the world today”, and called for the “immediate de-militarisation of the plant” and its transfer to “full Ukrainian control”. The Ukrainian president said he hoped the delegation would “find an opportunity, thanks to our special services, thanks to the security corridors, to get to the station and do the best to avoid all those threats on a global scale”. He also urged the mission to do more than inspect the plant, saying that strategic decisions were required “regarding the urgent demilitarisation of the station, the withdrawal of all, any, military personnel of the Russian Federation with explosives, with any kind of weapon”. The UN’s cultural agency has said it supports a bid by Ukraine to put its port city of Odesa on the Unesco world heritage list of protected sites. The historic centre of Odesa has already been “struck by artillery fire” and is “located only a few dozen kilometres from the front line”, the agency said in a statement. The statement followed a meeting of the agency’s director, Audrey Azoulay, and Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, in Paris. The agency added: On 24 July 2022, part of the large glass roof and windows of Odesa’s Museum of Fine Arts, inaugurated in 1899, were destroyed. It said it had mobilised experts to support Ukraine so that the nomination can be examined urgently by World Heritage Committee member states. The UN agency also said it wants to add Odesa, Kyiv and Lviv to the list of world heritage sites “in danger”. Russian state prosecutors have requested a 24-year prison term for the former journalist, Ivan Safronov, who is on trial for treason, his defence team has told Russian media. Safronov, 32, was one of Russia’s most respected journalists covering defence for the Kommersant and Vedomosti newspapers. He was arrested in July 2020 after leaving journalism to serve as an aide to the head of Russia’s space agency. He has been accused by Russia’s FSB security service of collecting military secrets about Russian arms sales in the Middle East and Africa and handing them over to the Czech Republic. Safronov has denied the charges and described the trial as “a complete travesty of justice”. Speaking to the Russian state-owned news agency, Ria, after a closed-door hearing, Safronov’s lawyer, Dmitry Katchev, said: The prosecutor asked to sentence Ivan to 24 years in a strict regime penal colony. Safronov’s previous lawyer, Yevgeny Smirnov, said on Facebook that his former client had turned down an offer of 12 years in jail in return for a guilty plea. The verdict in his case will be announced on 5 September, Russian news agencies said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has met the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, and his delegation ahead of the group’s visit to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. From the Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne: The deputy head of the Russian-installed administration in Ukraine’s occupied Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, said in a telephone interview that “everything in Kherson was under control”, claiming that Ukrainian spies and saboteurs were killed near Kherson’s Tavriiskyi neighbourhood on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, reports emerged that Stremousov had left Kherson after a video he posted appeared to indicate he was located in Voronezh, a Russian city some 600 miles from Kherson. When asked by the Guardian about his location, Stremousov said he was currently “travelling around Russian cities, meeting different people for work”. He said: I don’t have to sit [in Kherson]. I am the deputy head of the region and have the opportunity to move around … These are working trips. “Kherson will remain my base,” he added, denying he left Kherson out of safety concerns. Stremousov became the most senior Russian-appointed official in Kherson after the local governor, Volodymyr Saldo, was taken to hospital amid a suspected poisoning earlier in the summer. Stremousov’s apparent departure from Kherson comes after another Russian-appointed official in the region, Alexei Kovalev, was shot dead in his home over the weekend. In the past months, a number of Ukrainian nationals appointed by Russian forces in occupied territory have been killed or wounded in apparent partisan attacks. A Moscow-installed leader of occupied Kherson has reportedly fled to Russia, one day after Kyiv announced it had begun its long-awaited counter attack aimed at taking back the southern region from Russian forces. Kirill Stremousov, who was appointed deputy head of the Russian-backed Kherson military-civilian administration, has published regular video updates to state-owned Russian news outlets and his Telegram account. But a Ukrainian activist, Serhii Sternenko, has claimed Stremousov is no longer in Kherson and has instead been filming his recent video updates somewhere near the Cathedral of Annunciation in Voronezh in Russia, which can be seen in the background. Voronezh is almost 500 miles from Kherson and about 120 miles from the border with Ukraine. In a series of tweets, Sternenko wrote: Traitor to Ukraine and collaborator Stremousov escaped from Kherson and says that Kherson will forever remain Russian ... from Voronezh to Russia. He went on to claim that Stremousov was filming his videos from a Marriott hotel in Voronezh. A selection of images showing recent developments in Ukraine have dropped on the picture wires. The former head of Britain’s secret intelligence service, MI6, has welcomed Ukraine’s counterattacks in Kherson, saying it is a key moment in the war. Sir Alex Younger told the BBC that the fightback from Kyiv showed the two opposing forces had “reached some kind of balance, which is an unexpected and frankly welcome situation”. He added that western help had strengthened Ukrainian capability and that there was a long-term trend showing Russian military capability had slowly weakened. He said the new offensive in Kherson from Zelenskiy’s forces was “all about the urge of Ukraine to demonstrate they can get on the front foot”. It’s nearly 5.30pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Russian soldiers to flee for their lives after his forces launched an offensive to retake southern Ukraine. A senior presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, told Ukrainians not to expect rapid gains and described the offensive as a “slow operation to grind the enemy”. The Kremlin has insisted that its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine is going to plan despite the news that Kyiv’s troops have launched a long-awaited counteroffensive in the south of the country. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “The special military operation continues, it continues methodically, and in co-ordination with the current plans. All objectives will be fulfilled.” Kherson has been hit by a partial power outage and a partial shutdown of the water supply, Russian state news agencies have cited pro-Russian officials as saying. Traffic lights and building lights have also been reported going off in the Moscow-held region, according to Russian media. At least four people were killed and four wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv, the regional governor said. Writing on the Telegram messaging app, Oleh Synehubov said: “As a result of the shelling of the central part of Kharkiv, at least 4 people died and 4 more were injured.” A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog have arrived in Kyiv en route to inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, said a team will visit the plant from Wednesday to Saturday. A key adviser to Ukraine’s president accused Russian forces of deliberately shelling corridors for the IAEA inspectors to force them through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. The European Commission has said it will donate 5.5m potassium iodide tablets to Ukraine amid fears that fighting in the area of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant could lead to nuclear catastrophe.

At least 10 Russian cruise missiles have reportedly been fired by Moscow’s naval fleet in the Black Sea at the dummy targets, which are made of wood but look like US-supplied advanced rocket launcher systems when spotted by Russian drones, the Washington Post reports. Russia is reportedly struggling to find more soldiers to fight in Ukraine and has expanded recruitment efforts by eliminating the upper age limit and by tapping into prisons. The Pentagon believes that any more recruits added may not effectively expand overall combat power by the end of the year, according to a US official. Several brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces increased the weight of artillery fires in frontline sectors across southern Ukraine early on Monday, according to British intelligence. Ukrainian long-range precision strikes continue to disrupt Russian resupply; however, it is not yet possible to confirm the extent of Ukrainian advances, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest report. Germany and France have issued a joint warning against a ban on tourist visas for Russians, saying such a step would be counter-productive. The split on tourist visas will be at the heart of a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers in Prague on Tuesday and Wednesday, as they discuss what further steps they can take to sanction Russia for its six-month old invasion of Ukraine. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today on the Russia-Ukraine war blog. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Ukraine’s southern region of Kherson has been hit by a partial power outage, Russian state news agencies have cited pro-Russian officials as saying. Russian media also reported a partial shutdown of the water supply, as well as traffic lights and building lights going off. It comes after Ukrainian forces launched their long-awaited counteroffensive to take back the southern region from Russia. Russia has condemned the destruction of Soviet war memorials in the three Baltic states and accused them of persecuting their Russian-speaking minorities. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry accused Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia of being guilty of xenophobia and said they were treating their ethnic Russian minorities as “second-class people”. It claimed Russian-language media, kindergartens and schools were being shut down. Such “Russophobic approaches” will “certainly affect the state of bilateral relations with these countries, which are already in complete decline”, the ministry said. The first shipment of grain from Ukraine to the drought-stricken Horn of Africa since the war began has docked in Djibouti. The UN-chartered vessel Brave Commander, carrying 23,000 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat, set sail from the Ukrainian port of Yuzhne, east of Odesa, two weeks ago. The vessel is the first specially chartered by the UN’s World Food Programme to unblock food shipments stuck after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It will soon be followed by another carrying 7,000 tonnes. The total shipment, which will be unloaded in Djibouti and transported to Ethiopia, is enough to feed 1.5 million people for a month. Michael Dunford, the UN’s World Food Programme director for eastern Africa, said: This shipment, the first of many we hope, will allow WFP to deliver this grain to 1.53 million people in Ethiopia and cover their needs for a month. It’s a start but we must continue to keep the food flowing to save lives across the region. The European Commission has said it will donate 5.5m potassium iodide tablets to Ukraine amid fears that fighting in the area of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant could lead to nuclear catastrophe. The Commission said it had received a request from the Ukrainian government for potassium iodide tablets “as a preventative safety measure” to increase the level of protection around the nuclear plant. The tablets would be used “in limited scenarios to avoid that inhaled or swallowed radioactive iodine is absorbed by the thyroid”, the commission said. The EU is “pre-emptively” delivering the potassium iodide tablets to Ukraine to offer people protection “in case of exposure to high levels of radiation”, the commissioner for crisis management, Janez Lenarčič, said in a statement. He added: No nuclear power plant should ever be used as a war theatre. It is unacceptable that civilian lives are put in danger. A key adviser to Ukraine’s president has accused Russian forces of deliberately shelling corridors for a team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. Mykhailo Podolyak said Russia was attempting to force the mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. He also reiterated Ukraine’s call to demilitarise the area around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Ukraine has deployed a fleet of dummy rockets to trick Russian forces into wasting expensive long-range missiles on pointless targets, according to reports. The decoys are made of wood but look like US-supplied advanced rocket launcher systems when spotted by Russian drones, the Washington Post reports. At least 10 Russian cruise missiles have reportedly been fired by Moscow’s naval fleet in the Black Sea at the dummy targets, a senior Ukrainian official told the paper. A source said: When the UAVs see the battery, it’s like a VIP target. The initial success of the replicas has left Ukraine to make more of these wooden decoys in a bid to neutralise Russia’s artillery advantage on the battlefield. In addition, the destruction of Ukraine’s fleet of fake Himars may have been behind Russia’s claims that it has taken out a large number of the systems. The Kremlin has insisted that its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine is going to plan despite the news that Kyiv’s troops have launched a long-awaited counteroffensive in the south of the country. At his regular briefing with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was asked to respond to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s comments that Russian troops should flee after his military reportedly broke through several of their defences on Tuesday. Peskov replied: The special military operation continues, it continues methodically, and in co-ordination with the current plans. All objectives will be fulfilled. He also commented on calls by some European leaders for a ban on tourist visas for Russians, describing the proposals as “irrational” and the latest manifestation of the west’s anti-Russian agenda. He said Europe’s actions towards Russia were “bordering on insanity” adding: Of course, such decisions cannot go unanswered. Ukrainian troops have launched a counterattack in southern Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said, as he vowed to take back Russian-controlled areas, starting with Kherson. The Ukrainian president told the Russian military to flee after his military broke through several Russian defences on Tuesday. “There will be no place [for Russian troops] on Ukrainian land,” he said during his latest address posted to Telegram. Radiation levels at the Moscow-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remain normal, according to Russia’s defence ministry. In a statement, the ministry accused Ukrainian forces of firing two artillery shells into the territory of the nuclear power plant. It also claimed that it had a downed Ukrainian drone had crashed into the roof of a building storing nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. It is not possible to independently verify these claims. It is just past 1pm in Ukraine. Here is what you might have missed: Germany and France have issued a joint warning against a ban on tourist visas for Russians, saying such a step would be counter-productive, reports Reuters. The split on tourist visas will be at the heart of a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers in Prague on Tuesday and Wednesday, as they discuss what further steps they can take to sanction Russia for its six-month old invasion of Ukraine. Defence ministers meeting in Prague are likely to agree in principle on the less controversial step of organising joint military training missions for Ukrainian troops. Russia’s Gazprom has informed Engie it is reducing its gas deliveries, starting Tuesday, due to a disagreement between the parties over contracts, adding to concerns related to energy supplies, the French utility company said. At least four people were killed and four wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv, the regional governor said. Writing on the Telegram messaging app, Oleh Synehubov said:”As a result of the shelling of the central part of Kharkiv, at least 4 people died and 4 more were injured.” European Union defence ministers are set to pave the way for the establishment of an EU training mission for Ukrainian forces, the bloc’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said. Reuters reports that Borrell said: “The situation on the ground continues to be very bad. Ukraine needs our support, and we will continue providing support. A general, overall political agreement (on the training mission) is what I think we have to get today … I hope we will have a political green light for this mission.” Russia has faced “numerous failures” with Iranian-made drones acquired from Tehran this month for use in its war with Ukraine, according to a senior US administration official. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US understood that Russia had received the delivery of Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over several days this month. The official said it is likely to be part of a Russian plan to acquire hundreds of such vehicles, reports Reuters. Russian forces have killed two people and injured four others in Donetsk, the region’s governor said on Telegram. Pavlo Kyrylenko said the two people were killed in Rozdolne and Pivnichne. Ukrainian troops are mounting a long-awaited counteroffensive in the southern region of Kherson, military officials have said. “Today we started offensive actions in various directions, including in the Kherson region,” Ukraine’s southern command spokesperson, Natalia Humeniuk, said on Monday. She declined to provide more details about the new offensive but said Ukraine’s recent strikes on Russia’s southern logistical routes had “unquestionably weakened the enemy”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, added in a Monday evening address: “If they want to survive, it is time for the Russian military to flee. The occupiers should know: we will oust them to the border. To our border, the line of which has not changed.” Senior adviser to Ukraine’s president Oleksiy Arestovych described the counteroffensive as a “planned slow operation to grind the enemy”. In an update posted to his official Telegram account, Arestovych said: “We do not fight for show-offs and high-profile phrases as an enemy. We fight for a cause. And this thing takes time and effort. Therefore, be patient. This process will not be very fast, but will end with the installation of the Ukrainian flag over all the settlements of Ukraine.” Kyiv’s forces have broken through Russian defences in several sectors of the frontline near the city of Kherson, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy claimed. Oleksiy Arestovych said Ukrainian forces were also shelling the ferries in the Kherson region that Moscow is using to supply Russian-occupied territory on the west bank of the Dnieper River. A separate Ukrainian military source told CNN that its forces have taken back four villages near the city of Kherson after breaking through the frontline in three places, with the main “target” being Kherson. The operation began with heavy shelling of Russian positions and the rear, forcing them to flee, the source was quoted as saying. Ukrainian forces have heightened artillery fire in the south, according to British intelligence. Several brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces increased the weight of artillery fires in front line sectors across southern Ukraine early on Monday, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest report. Ukrainian long-range precision strikes also continue to disrupt Russian resupply. A Ukrainian barrage of rockets left the Russian-occupied town of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region without water or power, officials at the Russian-appointed local authority told Russia’s RIA news agency. The town lies just to the east of the city of Kherson. A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog arrived in Kyiv on Monday night en route to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, said a team will visit the plant from Wednesday to Saturday. “We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility,” Grossi tweeted. Missiles and shells are frequently hitting areas around the power station and nearby towns, prompting fears it may be too dangerous for the mission to proceed. The Kremlin said the IAEA mission was “necessary” but has ruled out vacating the site. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Ukraine expects the IAEA delegation to “state the facts” regarding the violation of all nuclear safety protocols, adding that Russia “is putting not only Ukraine but also the entire world at threat of risk of a nuclear accident”. Russian forces fired at Enerhodar, the city where the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located, according to Ukraine’s armed forces. Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, also appeared to confirm the reports on his Telegram channel alongside a video of firefighters dousing burning cars. Russia is struggling to find more soldiers to fight in Ukraine and has expanded recruitment efforts by eliminating the upper age limit and by tapping into prisons. “Many of these new recruits have been observed as older, unfit and ill-trained,” a Pentagon official told journalists on Monday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, decreed last week that his army would increase by about 10%, to 1.15 million service personnel, starting January next year. Ukrainian officials have warned politicians, experts and opinion leaders not to speculate about the progress of a military counteroffensive. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, Nataliya Humenyuk, said the operation in Kherson needed “silence” as media attention could affect the results. Ukraine’s presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, added it was necessary to wait for official statements from Ukraine’s ministry of defence and army. “I understand our wishes and dreams … But war is not ‘content’. Let’s filter information and work professionally out of respect for our defenders,” he wrote on Telegram. Germany and France have issued a joint warning against a ban on tourist visas for Russians, saying such a step would be counter-productive, reports Reuters. The split on tourist visas will be at the heart of a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers in Prague on Tuesday and Wednesday, as they discuss what further steps they can take to sanction Russia for its six-month old invasion of Ukraine. Defence ministers meeting in Prague are likely to agree in principle on the less controversial step of organising joint military training missions for Ukrainian troops. France and Germany said in the joint memo seen by Reuters: We caution against far-reaching restrictions on our visa policy, in order to prevent feeding the Russian narrative and trigger unintended rallying-around the flag effects and/or estranging future generations. Others, in particular eastern and Nordic member states, have argued strongly for a ban. Denmark’s foreign minister Jeppe Kofod said last week: It is very provocative to me that you see Russian men on European beaches in southern Europe and at the same time Ukrainian men between 18 and 60 years cannot even leave their country but have to fight for their freedom. We think it is right that we together in Europe can limit and cut off tourists from Russia and it would send a clear message to (President) Putin. Russians mostly enter the EU via the land borders of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland, Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said last week, adding that these countries may act on their own if the EU does not agree on a union-wide ban. Russia’s Gazprom has informed Engie it is reducing its gas deliveries, starting today, due to a disagreement between the parties over contracts, adding to concerns related to energy supplies, the French utility company said. A statement reported by Reuters said: As previously announced, Engie had already secured the volumes necessary to meet its commitments towards its customers and its own requirements, and put in place several measures to significantly reduce any direct financial and physical impacts that could result from an interruption to gas supplies by Gazprom. However, a French energy ministry official said the state-owned firm’s move to further reduce its gas deliveries to Engie does not jeopardise the security of France’s energy supplies. The official said: We prepared for it through the diversification of our supply sources and through the maximum replenishment of our stocks. Vitaliy Kim, the head of the Mykolayiv regional military administration, said today there has been heavy fighting in the south of the country. In a video posted on Twitter, Kim said military aid for drones and cars had decreased and urged volunteers to “put in the work again” to help get more equipment because the “Kherson liberation is not far off”. At least four people were killed and four wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv today, the regional governor said. Writing on the Telegram messaging app, Oleh Synehubov said: As a result of the shelling of the central part of Kharkiv, at least 4 people died and 4 more were injured. Kharkiv is the country’s second-largest city and was the subject of fierce attacks in the early stages of the war. European Union defence ministers are set to pave the way for the establishment of an EU training mission for Ukrainian forces, the bloc’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said today. Reuters reports that Borrell said: The situation on the ground continues to be very bad. Ukraine needs our support, and we will continue providing support. A general, overall political agreement (on the training mission) is what I think we have to get today … I hope we will have a political green light for this mission. His comments in Prague come hours before talks are set to take place in the city between foreign ministers to discuss a variety of issues, including a possible EU visa ban for Russian tourists. Russia has faced “numerous failures” with Iranian-made drones acquired from Tehran this month for use in its war with Ukraine, according to a senior US administration official. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US understood that Russia had received the delivery of Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over several days this month. The official said it is likely to be part of a Russian plan to acquire hundreds of such vehicles, reports Reuters. “We assess that Russia intends to use these Iranian UAVs, which can conduct air-to-surface attacks, electronic warfare, and targeting, on the battlefield in Ukraine,” the official said. In July, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters the US has information that shows Iran is preparing to provide Russia with up to several hundred drones. Isobel Koshiw reports for us from Kyiv: The long-awaited counter-offensive by Ukrainian troops appears to have started in the southern region of Kherson, with the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, saying: “If they want to survive, it is time for the Russian military to flee.” Ukrainian troops have broken through Russian defences in several areas of the frontline near the city of Kherson, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy claimed. Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video interview Ukrainian forces were also shelling the ferries in the Kherson region that Moscow is using to supply Russian-occupied territory on the west bank of the Dnieper River. But he cautioned Ukrainians against expecting a quick win in the south.

Pavlo Kyrylenko said the two people were killed in Rozdolne and Pivnichne. Russian-installed authorities in the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar accused Ukrainian troops today of once again shelling the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Russia’s Tass news agency said. The city authorities said two shells exploded near a spent fuel storage building at the plant, Reuters reports. Ukraine and Russia have repeatedly accused each other of attacking Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant. It is set to be visited this week by a mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, said a team will visit the plant from Wednesday to Saturday. It is 9am in Kyiv. Here is where we stand: Ukrainian troops are mounting a long-awaited counteroffensive in the southern region of Kherson, military officials have said. “Today we started offensive actions in various directions, including in the Kherson region,” Ukraine’s southern command spokesperson, Natalia Humeniuk, said on Monday. She declined to provide more details about the new offensive but said Ukraine’s recent strikes on Russia’s southern logistical routes had “unquestionably weakened the enemy”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, added in a Monday evening address: “If they want to survive, it is time for the Russian military to flee. The occupiers should know: we will oust them to the border. To our border, the line of which has not changed.” Senior adviser to Ukraine’s president Oleksiy Arestovych described the counteroffensive as a “planned slow operation to grind the enemy”. In an update posted to his official Telegram account, Arestovych said: “We do not fight for show-offs and high-profile phrases as an enemy. We fight for a cause. And this thing takes time and effort. Therefore, be patient. This process will not be very fast, but will end with the installation of the Ukrainian flag over all the settlements of Ukraine.” Kyiv’s forces have broken through Russian defences in several sectors of the frontline near the city of Kherson, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy claimed. Oleksiy Arestovych said Ukrainian forces were also shelling the ferries in the Kherson region that Moscow is using to supply Russian-occupied territory on the west bank of the Dnieper River. A separate Ukrainian military source told CNN that its forces have taken back four villages near the city of Kherson after breaking through the frontline in three places, with the main “target” being Kherson. The operation began with heavy shelling of Russian positions and the rear, forcing them to flee, the source was quoted as saying. Ukrainian forces have heightened artillery fire in the south, according to British intelligence. Several brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces increased the weight of artillery fires in front line sectors across southern Ukraine early on Monday, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest report. Ukrainian long-range precision strikes also continue to disrupt Russian resupply. A Ukrainian barrage of rockets left the Russian-occupied town of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region without water or power, officials at the Russian-appointed local authority told Russia’s RIA news agency. The town lies just to the east of the city of Kherson. A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog arrived in Kyiv on Monday night en route to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, said a team will visit the plant from Wednesday to Saturday. “We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility,” Grossi tweeted. Missiles and shells are frequently hitting areas around the power station and nearby towns, prompting fears it may be too dangerous for the mission to proceed. The Kremlin said the IAEA mission was “necessary” but has ruled out vacating the site. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Ukraine expects the IAEA delegation to “state the facts” regarding the violation of all nuclear safety protocols, adding that Russia “is putting not only Ukraine but also the entire world at threat of risk of a nuclear accident”. Russian forces fired at Enerhodar, the city where the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located, according to Ukraine’s armed forces. Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, also appeared to confirm the reports on his Telegram channel alongside a video of firefighters dousing burning cars. Russia is struggling to find more soldiers to fight in Ukraine and has expanded recruitment efforts by eliminating the upper age limit and by tapping into prisons. “Many of these new recruits have been observed as older, unfit and ill-trained,” a Pentagon official told journalists on Monday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, decreed last week that his army would increase by about 10%, to 1.15 million servicemen, starting January next year. Ukrainian officials have warned politicians, experts and opinion leaders not to speculate about the progress of a military counteroffensive. Spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, Nataliya Humenyuk, said the operation in Kherson needed “silence” as media attention could affect the results. Ukraine’s presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, added it was necessary to wait for official statements from Ukraine’s ministry of defence and army. “I understand our wishes and dreams … But war is not ‘content’. Let’s filter information and work professionally out of respect for our defenders,” he wrote on Telegram. Senior adviser to Ukraine’s president Oleksiy Arestovych has given more details on the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson. In an update posted to his official Telegram account, Arestovych said: Today began an active part of the liberation of the south from the Russian invaders. This is a planned slow operation to grind the enemy, saving the lives of our military and civilians. Of course, many would like a large-scale offensive with news about the capture by our military of a settlement in an hour. But we don’t fight like that. Yes, funds are limited. We do not fight for show-offs and high-profile phrases as an enemy. We fight for a cause. And this thing takes time and effort. Therefore, be patient. This process will not be very fast, but will end with the installation of the Ukrainian flag over all the settlements of Ukraine.” Russia is reportedly struggling to find more soldiers to fight in Ukraine and has expanded recruitment efforts by eliminating the upper age limit and by tapping into prisons. “Many of these new recruits have been observed as older, unfit and ill-trained,” a Pentagon official told journalists on Monday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, decreed last week that his army would increase by about 10%, to 1.15 million servicemen, starting January next year. After experiencing significant setbacks and heavy troop losses in six months after invading Ukraine, the Pentagon believes that “this effort is unlikely to succeed, as Russia has historically not met personnel and strength targets,” the official said. The Pentagon’s conclusion is that any more recruits added may not effectively expand overall combat power by the end of the year, according to the official. Several brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces increased the weight of artillery fires in frontline sectors across southern Ukraine early on Monday, according to British intelligence. Ukrainian long-range precision strikes continue to disrupt Russian resupply; however, it is not yet possible to confirm the extent of Ukrainian advances, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest report. The full report reads: Since the start of August, Russia has made significant efforts to reinforce its force on the western bank of the Dnipro River around Kherson. The Southern Military District’s (SMD) 49th Combined Arms Army has highly likely been augmented with components of the Eastern Military District’s (EMD) 35th Combined Arms Army. Most of the units around Kherson are likely under-manned and are reliant upon fragile supply lines by ferry and pontoon bridges across the Dnipro. This integration of SMD and EMD units suggests a significant reorganisation of Russia’s force in Ukraine. There is a realistic possibility that Russia has moved to rationalise the several, semi-independent, operational commands which contributed to its poor performance early in the invasion. If Ukraine succeeds in undertaking sustained offensive operations, the cohesion of this untested structure will likely be a key factor in the sustainability of Russian defences in the south.” A team of experts assembled by the UN nuclear watchdog will inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine from Wednesday. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, said a team arrived in Kyiv on Monday night.

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Ukraine expects the IAEA delegation to “state the facts” regarding the violation of all nuclear safety protocols, adding that Russia “is putting not only Ukraine but also the entire world at threat of risk of a nuclear accident”. Russia’s defence ministry acknowledged a new Ukrainian offensive had been launched in the Mykolaiv and Kherson regions but said it had failed and the Ukrainians had suffered significant casualties, RIA news agency reported. The “enemy’s offensive attempt failed miserably,” it said. However, officials at the Russian-appointed local authority later told the outlet that a Ukrainian barrage of rockets left the Russian-occupied town of Nova Kakhovka just east of the city of Kherson without water or power. The battlefield reports could not be independently verified. Kyiv’s forces have reportedly broken through Russian defences in several sectors of the frontline near the city of Kherson, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy has claimed. “I should note today the (Russian) defences were broken through in a few hours,” Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video interview on Youtube. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, Nataliya Humenyuk, said Ukraine’s forces had struck more than 10 sites in the past week and “unquestionably weakened the enemy” during a Monday briefing. Humenyuk declined to give details, saying Russian forces in the south remained “quite powerful” and that the operation needed “silence” as media attention could affect the results. Her claims could not be independently corroborated. Sergiy Khlan, a local deputy and adviser to the regional governor told Ukraine’s Pryamyi TV channel on Monday: Today there was a powerful artillery attack on enemy positions in ... the entire territory of the occupied Kherson region. This is the announcement of what we have been waiting for since the spring - it is the beginning of the end of the occupation of Kherson region.” “What is happening now is a prepared, well-balanced start of a counteroffensive,” Khlan told Agence France-Presse. A seperate Ukrainian military source told CNN that its forces have taken back four villages near the city of Kherson after breaking through the frontline in three places, with the main “target” being Kherson.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not address the counteroffensive specifically during his Monday evening address but said: If they want to survive, it is time for the Russian military to flee. The occupiers should know: we will oust them to the border. To our border, the line of which has not changed.” Those who surrendered would be treated under the Geneva conventions, he said, adding: “If they do not listen to me, they will deal with our defenders, who will not stop until they liberate everything that belongs to Ukraine.” “Ukraine is returning its own. It will return the Kharkiv region, Luhansk region, Donetsk region, Zaporizhzhia region, Kherson region, Crimea … This will happen.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

Moscow welcomes a visit by the UN nuclear watchdog to the Zaporizhzhia plant, a top Russian diplomat said. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia was not considering the possibility of creating a demilitarised zone at the plant. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has warned that the IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia plant will be the “hardest in the history” of the agency.

Russia’s FSB security service has accused another Ukrainian of being part of a team that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin. The FSB said it had now identified what it called another member of a Ukrainian “sabotage and terrorist group” which it said had plotted and carried out the killing. Ukraine has denied involvement in the murder of Dugina. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thanks for following along. I’ll be back tomorrow. Two people have been killed after Russian shelling hit residential areas of the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, city officials and witnesses said. A woman has died after the strike hit a family home directly next to a school, a Reuters correspondent reported. Both houses on the property were left in ruins, with large craters gouged out of the ground in front. The owner of the home, Olexandr Shulga, said he grew up in the home and had lived there his entire life. His wife died at the scene, Shulga said. Police, military officials and Ukrainian war crimes prosecutors were at the site in a residential neighbourhood of Mykolaiv. Russia’s defence ministry has responded to Ukraine’s claims that its troops have launched a long-awaited counter-offensive in the south of the country. Russia’s state-owned news agency Ria cites the ministry as saying that Ukraine’s troops attempted an offensive in southern Mykolaiv and Kherson regions, sustaining significant casualties. The ministry added: Enemy’s offensive attempt failed miserably. It is not possible to verify these claims. Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko has said a “long-awaited” Ukrainian counteroffensive against Russian forces is underway in the south of the country to retake Moscow-controlled territory. Speaking to CNN, Poroshenko said: This is the long-awaited counteroffensive operation. It was started today at 7:00 a.m. (local time) with shelling and missiles attack. He added: This is first time since February 2022 when such a [concentration] of Ukrainian troops with western artillery, with western HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) and western missiles was collected together for this counterattack. It is not possible to independently verify his claims. The EU plans to make it harder for Russians to travel to the bloc by suspending a deal that eases their visa applications, according to reports. AFP cites an EU diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Prague, as saying: We cannot continue the visa policy as it has been up to now. Tourism “is not a human right”, the diplomat added. The bloc has already suspended visa facilitation for Russian official delegations and business leaders. The new measure, which if approved could come into force in October, does not amount to a formal ban on tourism visas but would complicate the process. Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland have urged Brussels to ban Russian tourists from obtaining visas for the EU’s Schengen common travel area. The issue will be debated at a two-day meeting of EU foreign ministers starting tomorrow. The source said he expected a “robust debate” at the meeting but said a full visa ban would have to be part of a new sanctions package and receive the unanimous backing of member states. A team from the UN nuclear watchdog due to visit the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south Ukraine has left Vienna, the Ukrainian foreign ministry has said. The mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is due to arrive in Kyiv today, the ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko wrote on Facebook. He added: It is expected that the mission will start work at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in the coming days. Russia’s FSB security service has accused without evidence a second Ukrainian citizen of preparing the car bomb that killed the daughter of an ultranationalist Russian ideologue this month. The FSB had previously claimed Ukrainian intelligence plotted the murder of Darya Dugina, a pro-war pundit who was killed when a bomb tore through the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving near Moscow after a conservative festival. Ukraine has strenuously denied any connection to the killing, with a government spokesperson saying that “we are not a criminal state, unlike Russia, and definitely not a terrorist state”. Dugina was the daughter of the political philosopher Alexander Dugin, a radical voice on foreign policy who has called for conflict with the west and told Russians they should “kill, kill, kill” Ukrainians. On Monday, Russia alleged that a member of a Ukrainian “sabotage and terrorist group” acquired fake documents and helped to assemble the car bomb in a garage in southern Moscow. The agency released video of the person it said was the suspect, but it did not publish any evidence that showed he had been involved in the killing. The agency’s claims could not be independently verified by the Guardian. Read the full article by my colleague Andrew Roth here. Here’s more on the reports that Russian shelling of private homes in Mykolaiv earlier today left several people dead, according to the regional governor, Vitaliy Kim. Mykolaiv mayor, Oleksandr Sienkevych, said at least two civilians were killed and five others were injured after shelling by Russian forces on residential buildings and educational institutions. Writing on Telegram, Sienkevych said: Russian bastards follow their rules and cynically shell civilians. Mykolaiv. Information as of 16:30. Residential buildings and educational institutions were hit. It is currently known about two killed and five injured. It has not been possible to independently verify this information.

Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Nadiia Vorobei is giving a tour of her ruined, green-walled home on a rainy afternoon in the village of Andriivka, 30 miles west of Kyiv. The 66-year-old says that in March she was “literally carried out of the house” by Russian soldiers so they could forcibly billet themselves within it. Two weeks later, on 18 March, the property was devastated in the fighting. She says it burned out in 20 minutes after an explosion while she looked on from her neighbours’ house next door. The destruction of the home her parents had built was painful to watch, she says. Since then, Vorobei says, she has had no help from Ukraine’s authorities. A couple of friends are trying to rebuild her garage in time for winter, but she has no money to pay for further help. Her pension is 2,500 hryvnia (about £57) a month, enough to cover basic living costs and no more. Volunteers donated a small shipping container in April, where Vorobei lives at the rear of the property. It is tiny, the length of a single bed, with chipboard walls and electricity but no water or gas. Possessions are piled high in the little space available. “I call it a doghouse,” she says. Five months after the Russians were forced out of the towns and villages north-west of Kyiv, it is clear that reconstruction and recovery is at best slow and at worst nonexistent. Read the full story by Dan Sabbagh and Artem Mazhulin: ‘I call it the doghouse’: slow progress on rebuilding ruined homes near Kyiv Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russia of economic terrorism as the cost of Europe’s energy crisis spiralled, Reuters reported. “Russia is using economic terror,” Zelenskiy told an energy industry conference in the Norwegian city of Stavanger. “It is exerting pressure with price crisis, with poverty, to weaken Europe,” Zelenskiy told the audience via a translator. Another multinational has announced its intentions to wind down its remaining operations in Russia, Reuters has reported. Computer accessories giant Logitech International said on Monday it would wind down its remaining operations in Russia due to the “ongoing uncertain environment”, joining other major technology and telecoms businesses to announce plans for a complete exit. “In March, we communicated that Logitech would stop shipments to Russia,” Logitech said in a statement. “We have monitored the situation closely and regrettably, the circumstances do not allow for us to continue to do business as before.” A number of civilians have been killed after Russian shelling of private homes in Mykolaiv, according to the regional governor, Vitaliy Kim. Writing on Telegram, Kim said: The centre of the city is being heavily shelled. There are still rockets being launched. Do not leave shelters. Powerful explosions have been reported today in Mykolaiv. as well as in the Russian-occupied Kherson, with residents urged to stay in shelters. The Guardian has not been able to verify the regional governor’s report. Here’s more on the reports that Ukraine’s forces have started a long-awaited counter-offensive in the country’s south. The US believes that Kyiv’s troops have begun “shaping” operations in the south of the country to prepare for a significant Ukrainian counter-offensive, CNN reports. According to two senior US officials, the US believes the counter-offensive will include a combination of air and ground operations. Shaping operations are standard military practice prior to an offensive, and usually involve striking weapons systems, command and control, ammunition depots and other targets to prepare the battlefield for planned advances. Ukraine has started a long-awaited counter-offensive in the country’s south, its southern military command has announced, amid reports that Ukrainian troops were able to break through Russian lines in the Kherson region. Ukraine’s southern command spokesperson, Natalia Humeniuk, was cited by Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne as saying: Today we started offensive actions in various directions, including in the Kherson region. She declined to provide more details about the new offensive but said Ukraine’s recent strikes on Russia’s southern logistical routes had “unquestionably weakened the enemy”. More than 10 Russian ammunition dumps had been hit over the last week, Humeniuk added. Humeniuk’s comments came after reports from Ukrainian newspapers that units of Ukraine’s defence forces had last night launched a counteroffensive on the right bank of the Dnipro river in Kherson Oblast. Soldiers deployed on the front lines have reportedly said they managed to break through the first line of Russian defence in the region. The Guardian has not been able to verify these reports. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has warned that the UN nuclear watchdog’s mission to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine will be the “hardest in the history” of the agency. Russia “is putting not only Ukraine but also the entire world at threat of risk of a nuclear accident”, Kuleba said during a visit to Stockholm. Kuleba said: This mission will be the hardest in the history of the IAEA, given the active combat activities undertaken by the Russian Federation on the ground and also the very blatant way that Russia is trying to legitimise its presence. He also demanded Russia leave the nuclear plant, adding: Russia must go and the IAEA as well as many countries of the world, we have to make them go, it’s as simple as that. This is the only way to ensure nuclear security. Moscow has said it welcomes a visit by the UN nuclear watchdog to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed earlier today that it would inspect the Zaporizhzhia – Europe’s largest nuclear plant – this week and that a team was en route to the facility. The mission will assess any physical damage to the plant, determine the functionality of safety and security systems, evaluate staff conditions and perform urgent safeguards activities, it said. A top Russian diplomat said Moscow hoped the IAEA visit would dispel misconceptions about the plant’s allegedly poor state, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Ria. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s permanent representative to the international organisations in Vienna, was quoted by Ria as saying that his country had worked hard to help make the visit possible and understood that the IAEA wanted to leave several representatives at the plant on a permanent basis. Ulyanov was cited as saying: As far as we understand, it is the director general’s intention to leave several people at the station on a permanent basis. He added: Russia has made a significant contribution to the preparation of this mission. We hope that the visit of the plant by the IAEA mission will dispel numerous speculations about the unfavorable state of affairs at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Meanwhile, the Kremlin accused Ukraine of “exposing the European continent to danger” ahead of the IAEA visit to the Zaporizhzhia plant. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow welcomed the upcoming mission and was ready to cooperate with the IAEA. But he added that Russia was not considering the possibility of creating a demilitarised zone at the plant. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling in the plant’s vicinity in recent weeks, while denying the claims themselves. Hello everyone. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. It is just after 1pm in Ukraine. Here is what you may have missed: The UN nuclear watchdog will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant this week, its director general has said. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, tweeted confirmation of the visit early on Monday. The mission will assess any physical damage to the plant, determine the functionality of safety and security systems, evaluate staff conditions and perform urgent safeguards activities. Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu is being “sidelined” due to problems in the war against Ukraine and is likely being ridiculed by soldiers for his “ineffectual” leadership, said British intelligence. The latest update from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) that Shoigu has probably “struggled” to overcome his reputation as not having much military experience. Russia’s FSB security service today named another Ukrainian it said was part of a team that assassinated Darya Dugina. Dugina, the daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin was killed in a car bombing outside Moscow on 20 August. Two days after the 29-year-old’s murder, the FSB said it had solved the case, naming a Ukrainian woman it said had trailed Dugina for weeks, rented an apartment in her housing complex and planted the car bomb before fleeing Russia to Estonia - all with Kyiv’s backing. The FSB said it had now identified what it called another member of a Ukrainian “sabotage and terrorist group” which it said had plotted and carried out the killing, reports Reuters. Ericsson said it will gradually wind down business activities in Russia over the coming months. The company, which suspended its business in Russia indefinitely in April, said it has about 400 employees in Russia and would provide financial support to affected employees, reports Reuters. Dell Technologies Inc said on Saturday it had ceased all Russian operations after closing its offices in mid-August. New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has admitted the body of a New Zealand soldier who died defending Ukraine may never be returned home. Corporal Dominic Abelen, 28, was on leave without pay when he travelled to Ukraine to fight in the war against defence force rules and without telling his family. Foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta has stressed New Zealand is treating the case of Abelen as a citizen rather than a soldier, though there are calls to bring Abelen’s remains home. Ardern said questions of how to treat Abelen were secondary to practical ones during a string of radio and media appearances on Monday morning. European Union defence and foreign ministers will meet in Prague this week to discuss options for setting up a military training mission for Ukrainian forces and also look into calls by some members to ban Russian tourists from entering the bloc, reports Reuters. The bloc’s foreign policy and security chief, Josep Borrell, has given few details of his plans so far, merely stating such a military training programme would not be based in Ukraine but in neighbouring countries. In meetings on Monday and Tuesday this week, officials will also discuss a proposed visa ban for Russians. Russian forces are “reconstructing” the Mariupol theatre to cover war crimes, according to an adviser to the city’s mayor. Petr Andriushchenko said Moscow’s forces are rebuilding the theatre under the guise of reconstruction for “historical value”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, held a meeting with representatives of Ukraine’s defence and security sectors on Sunday. “All the issues we considered are important, but secret, I cannot go into detail,” he said. The meeting was attended by the heads of the armed forces, intelligence agencies, the ministry of defence, the ministry of internal affairs, the Ukrainian security service as well as other defence forces. Russian artillery fired at Ukrainian towns across the river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, local officials said on Sunday. The regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said Russian forces struck residential buildings in the main city of Zaporizhzhia and the town of Orikhiv farther east. Ukraine’s military reported shelling of nine more towns in the area on the opposite side of the Dnieper river from the plant. The US has said Russia does not want to acknowledge the grave radiological risk at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, adding that was the reason it blocked a nuclear non-proliferation treaty deal’s final draft. “The Russian Federation alone decided to block consensus on a final document at the conclusion of the Tenth Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Russia did so in order to block language that merely acknowledged the grave radiological risk at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine,” said a US state department statement. Concern about the potential risk of radiation leaks at the plant persists. Ukrainian and Russian authorities issued fresh warnings about the risk of radioactive leaks, after shelling that the sides blamed on each other. Ukraine’s state energy operator warned there are “risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances”. Russia has ignored widespread international calls for the area to be demilitarised. Ukrainians are likely to experience their coldest winter in decades, its gas chief has said, as the thermostats on its Soviet-era centralised heating systems are set to be switched on later and turned down. Yurii Vitrenko, the head of the state gas company Naftogaz, said indoor temperatures would be set at between 17-18C, about four degrees lower than normal, and he advised people to stock up on blankets and warm clothes for when outdoor temperatures fall to and beyond the -10C winter average. Germany is replenishing its gas stocks more quickly than expected despite drastic Russian supply cuts and should meet an October target early, the government has said. Europe’s largest economy is heavily dependent on Russian gas and has raced to bolster its reserves before winter, crediting energy-saving measures in recent weeks and massive purchases of gas from other suppliers. EU foreign ministers are expected to suspend Russian tourist visa facilitation next week. The EU move falls short of an outright ban but would make getting travel documents significantly more complicated and expensive. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said a ban would lack the necessary support. “I don’t think that to cut the relationship with the Russian civilian population will help and I don’t think that this idea will have the required unanimity,” he told Austria’s ORF TV on Sunday. Russia’s FSB security service today named another Ukrainian it said was part of a team that assassinated Darya Dugina. Dugina, the daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was killed in a car bombing outside Moscow on 20 August. Two days after the 29-year-old’s murder, the FSB said it had solved the case, naming a Ukrainian woman it said had trailed Dugina for weeks, rented an apartment in her housing complex and planted the car bomb before fleeing Russia to Estonia – all with Kyiv’s backing. Ukraine has denied involvement in the murder of Dugina. The FSB said it had now identified what it called another member of a Ukrainian “sabotage and terrorist group” which it said had plotted and carried out the killing, reports Reuters. It said in a statement that the new suspect, a man born in 1978 who it named and showed CCTV footage of, had helped assemble the car bomb in a rented garage in Moscow and had secured fake documents and number plates for the woman who had planted the bomb on Dugina’s car. The man had exited Russia via Estonia a day before the attack, it said. In an 11-minute video released by the FSB, CCTV footage showed the man entering Russia on 30 July, entering and exiting a garage complex in Moscow, collecting what the FSB said were fake number plates, and exiting Russia in the early hours of 19 August, the day before Dugina was killed. Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu is being “sidelined” due to problems in the war against Ukraine and is likely being ridiculed by soldiers for his “ineffectual” leadership, said British intelligence. The latest update from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said: Recent independent Russian media reports have claimed that due to the problems Russia is facing in its war against Ukraine, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu is now being sidelined within the Russian leadership, with operational commanders briefing President Putin directly on the course of the war. Russian officers and soldiers with first-hand experience of the war probably routinely ridicule Shoigu for his ineffectual and out-of-touch leadership as Russian progress has stalled. The update added that Shoigu has probably “struggled” to overcome his reputation as not having much military experience. Ericsson said today it will gradually wind down business activities in Russia over the coming months. The company, which suspended its business in Russia indefinitely in April, said it had about 400 employees in Russia and would provide financial support to affected employees, reports Reuters. A number of western companies are selling their Russian businesses after announcing suspensions of operations in the weeks after Moscow invaded Ukraine in February. Dell Technologies Inc said on Saturday it had ceased all Russian operations after closing its offices in mid-August. Its Finnish rival Nokia had already announced its decision to pull out of Russia, impacting about 2,000 employees. The Finnish company did not respond to a request for comment on when the exit will complete. The G7 today welcomed a trip by the UN nuclear watchdog to Ukraine‘s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and reiterated concerns about the safety of the plant under the control of Russian armed forces. In a statement reported by Reuters, it said: We reaffirm that the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant and the electricity that it produces rightly belong to Ukraine and stress that attempts by Russia to disconnect the plant from the Ukrainian power grid would be unacceptable. As we reported earlier a team from the UN nuclear watchdog said it was on its way to the plant that was captured by Russian troops in March but run by Ukrainian staff, and will reach it later this week. ‘There were a lot of mines around [the pitch]’, says the former captain of Obolon Kyiv’s second team. ‘Even now we are still afraid to kick the ball over the fence.’ Kostja Kovalenko describes the reality of life at the team’s training ground before their first match in Ukraine’s second tier, as the Guardian visits the outskirts of Bucha, a war-torn suburb of the capital. Reuters reports that in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, Russian forces shelled military and civilian infrastructure near Bakhmut, Shumy, Yakovlivka, Zaytsevo, and Kodema, Ukraine’s military said early today. Russian strikes killed eight civilians in Donetsk province on Sunday, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. Russia denies targeting civilians. Isobel Koshiw for us from Kyiv: Ukrainians are likely to experience the coldest winter in decades, its gas chief has said, as the thermostats on its Soviet-era centralised heating systems are set to be switched on later and turned down. Yurii Vitrenko, the head of the state gas company Naftogaz, said indoor temperatures would be set at between 17 and 18C, about four degrees lower than normal, and he advised people to stock up on blankets and warm clothes for when outdoor temperatures fall to and beyond the -10C winter average. “Heating season”, the period when the central heating is on, will come later and end earlier, said Vitrenko. The target depends on Ukraine’s international allies giving it the necessary funds to import 4bn cubic metres worth of gas, as well as no wildcards playing out – such as Russia destroying gas infrastructure or further decreasing its gas supplies to Europe.

The bloc’s foreign policy and security chief, Josep Borrell, has given few details of his plans so far, merely stating such a military training programme would not be based in Ukraine but in neighbouring countries. In meetings on Monday and Tuesday this week, officials will also discuss a proposed visa ban for Russians. The Czechs, who currently hold the EU’s rotating presidency, are pushing for an EU-wide ban on visas for Russian tourists, an idea supported mainly by the Baltic countries. However, Germany, some other member states and Borrell reject such a move, arguing it might breach EU rules and cut off escape routes for Russian dissidents. The Lithuanian foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, has said Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland, which all share a border with Russia, may act on their own to block tourists if the EU does not agree on a union-wide ban. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called on the west earlier this month to impose a blanket travel ban on Russians, drawing an angry rebuke from Moscow. New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has admitted the body of a New Zealand soldier who died defending Ukraine may never be returned home. Corporal Dominic Abelen, 28, was on leave without pay when he travelled to Ukraine to fight in the war against defence force rules and without telling his family. Foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta has stressed New Zealand is treating the case of Abelen as a citizen rather than a soldier, though there are calls to bring Abelen’s remains home. Ardern said questions of how to treat Abelen were secondary to practical ones during a string of radio and media appearances on Monday morning. The issue is whether or not we’re even going to have that ability (to access Ukraine) ... it is a war zone. We do not have people on the ground. We do not have consular support on the ground. It’s very difficult for us to to do much at this present point in time. That does not mean however that we are not seeking as much information as possible and trying to understand the circumstances.” Ardern declined to answer questions around the matter, including where Abelen died, where his body is, whether they know where the body is, and if it is in Russian hands. Local media reports suggest Abelen died while attempting to re-take a series of trenches in the eastern Donbas region. Ardern did say Abelen’s family were being briefed, saying “they have as much information as we have”. Russian forces are “reconstructing” the Mariupol theatre to cover war crimes, according to an advisor to the city’s mayor. Petr Andriushchenko said Moscow’s forces are rebuilding the theatre under the guise of reconstruction for “historical value”. The occupiers are hiding their own war crime … They are in a hurry to eliminate all traces and evidence through ‘reconstruction’. Under the guise of ‘historical value’. … The only historical value arose when two bombs fell. And it is this historical value that the occupiers are now trying to hide.” Russian forces struck the theatre back in March, killing an estimated 300 people who were using the building for refuge. Russia is increasing mobilisation reserves and plans to mobilise about 90,000 military personnel, according to Ukrainian intelligence. The representative of the main directorate of intelligence of the ministry of defence of Ukraine, Vadym Skibitsky, said in a statement on Sunday: At the same time, different approaches are used: so-called volunteer battalions, and reserve battalions, battalions of the so-called ‘combat army reserve of the country’ (BARS), which they are now recruiting in each military district in order to replenish losses, increase their efforts, and to increase the number of the very group that can be used against our state.” According to Skibitsky, Russia is having significant problems in equipping its armed forces. Time is running out, they did not receive a blitzkrieg. Will the mobilisation of more people in the Russian Federation help? Probably not, after all. Because the morale of military personnel, as they conduct combat operations, decreases, firstly. Secondly, there are fewer and fewer willing to enter the ranks of the Soviet Union on a voluntary basis. In addition, panic has begun among the population of large cities, because no one wants to simply go to serve in the armed forces, let alone go to war.” Russian forces fired at Enerhodar, the city where the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located, according to Ukraine’s armed forces. Russian forces are shelling the residential quarters of the city. Cars and houses of civilians are burning,” the military said alongside footage purportedly from the attack published to its official Telegram account In the footage multiple cars can be seen engulfed in flames as firefighters rush to extinguish the blaze. The chief of staff of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also appeared to confirm the reports late on Sunday on his Telegram channel alongside a video of fire fighters dousing burning cars. “They provoke and try to blackmail the world,” chief of staff Andriy Yermak said. Russian forces have pounded Ukrainian towns across the river from the plant over recent days, officials have said. Regional governor Oleksandr Starukh said on Telegram on Sunday that Russian forces struck residential buildings in the main city of Zaporizhzhia, about a two-hour drive from the plant, and the town of Orikhiv further east. Ukraine’s military reported shelling of nine more towns in the area on the opposite side of the Dnipro river, while the Russian state news agency cited authorities as saying they had downed a Ukrainian drone which planned to attack the nuclear-waste storage facility at the plant. The UN nuclear watchdog will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant this week, its director general has confirmed. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, tweeted early this morning: The day has come, the IAEA’s support and assistance mission to Zaporizhzhia (ISAMZ) is now on its way. We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility. Proud to lead this mission which will be in ZNPP later this week.” The mission will assess any physical damage to the plant, determine the functionality of safety and security systems, evaluate staff conditions and perform urgent safeguards activities.

The strike comes after Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, held a meeting with representatives of Ukraine’s defence and security sectors on Sunday. It is 8am in Kyiv. Here is where we stand: Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, held a meeting with representatives of Ukraine’s defence and security sectors on Sunday. “All the issues we considered are important, but secret, I cannot go into detail,” he said.

Ukraine’s military reported shelling of nine more towns in the area on the opposite side of the Dnieper river from the plant. The UN nuclear watchdog is waiting for clearance for its officials to visit the plant “to help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there”. The Energoatom head, Petro Kotin, told the Guardian a visit from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) could come before the end of the month, but the Ukrainian energy minister, Lana Zerkal, told a local radio station she was not convinced Russia was negotiating in good faith. The US has said Russia does not want to acknowledge the grave radiological risk at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, adding that was the reason it blocked a nuclear non-proliferation treaty deal’s final draft. “The Russian Federation alone decided to block consensus on a final document at the conclusion of the Tenth Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

The day-ahead price for power for delivery on Monday reached a record £675 a megawatt-hour on the Epex Spot SE exchange. The price for power at 5-6pm, typically around the time of peak power demand each day, passed an all-time high of £2,586 a megawatt-hour. Prices are surging as the weather forces Britons to increase their heating use, pushing up demand for energy, despite high bills. Snow and ice have caused disruption as the cold weather looks set to continue into this week, with snow forecast for parts of east and south-east England, as well as Scotland. The cold snap, which is expected to last for at least a week, comes as wind speeds reduced sharply, hitting power suppliers. Live data from the National Grid’s Electricity System Operator showed that wind power was providing just 3% of Great Britain’s electricity generation on Sunday. Gas-fired power stations provided 59%, while nuclear power and electricity imports both accounted for about 15%. The increase in power prices come amid jitters over energy supplies this winter. National Grid warned in October that a combination of factors such as a cold spell and a shortage of gas in Europe related to the war in Ukraine could lead to power cuts in the UK. The anticipated surge in power demand on Monday evening will coincide with a planned use of the National Grid’s demand flexibility service between 5pm and 7pm. The scheme pays businesses and households to cut their consumption at peak times to reduce the strain on the grid. The scheme has been used several times as part of a series of tests but is yet to be used as a result of electricity supply shortages. National Grid flirted with using it under these circumstances last month but did not do so. Dr Agostinho Moreira de Sousa, a consultant in public health medicine at UK Health Security Agency, encouraged those with health conditions to heat their homes to a comfortable temperature. “In rooms you mostly use such as the living room or bedroom, try to heat them to at least 18C if you can. Keep your bedroom windows closed at night. Wearing several layers of clothing will keep you warmer than one thicker layer,” he said. German day-ahead power prices rose 33% to €434 (£373) a megawatt-hour, the highest since 13 September, while the French contract rose 40% to €465 a megawatt-hour, Bloomberg reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/08/uk-to-unveil-nuclear-submarines-deal-with-australia-sources-say","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T01:23:34Z","webTitle":"Aukus submarine deal: Australia expected to choose UK design, sources say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/uk-to-unveil-nuclear-submarines-deal-with-australia-sources-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/08/uk-to-unveil-nuclear-submarines-deal-with-australia-sources-say","fields":{"headline":"Aukus submarine deal: Australia expected to choose UK design, sources say","bodyText":"An enthusiastic Rishi Sunak has told ministers to expect a positive outcome next week when he travels to San Diego to unveil a deal to supply nuclear-powered submarines to Australia as part of the Aukus pact with the US. Multiple sources said they believed the UK had succeeded in its bid to sell British-designed nuclear submarines to Australia, a deal that will safeguard the long-term future of the shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness. A senior minister said Sunak had told colleagues he was delighted by the outcome of the negotiations, which have been going on for 18 months and have presented Australia with a choice between a British or a US design, based on the existing Astute or Virginia class submarines. “The deal has definitely gone our way. The prime minister was buzzing about it when he told ministers, smiling and bouncing on the balls of his feet,” the minister said. A second source outside government with knowledge of the talks said they had also been told to expect a British design success when the deal is announced on Monday, although any final submarine will also make heavy use of US technology. Sunak is due to travel to the west coast for a trilateral summit with Joe Biden, the US president, and Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister, on Monday, where he also expected to unveil a refresh of Britain’s integrated review of defence and foreign policy in the light of the war in Ukraine. Supplying Australia with a nuclear-powered submarine was the centrepiece for the Aukus defence pact, announced in September 2021, with the US and UK agreeing to share secret reactor technology in a surprise deal, so Canberra could dump an alternative diesel-powered design from France. The expectation, one source indicated, was that Australia would work jointly on a design for a next generation submarine with the UK, evolving from the existing Astute submarine design, although it may not be seaworthy until the 2040s because of the complexity of the work. Further reports last night suggested that the short-term gap could be plugged by Australia buying up to five Virginia-class submarines from the US as part of the three-way deal. Meanwhile, an alternative plan that the UK could even be willing to sell or lease the two Astute class submarines yet to be completed at Barrow, HMS Agincourt and HMS Agamemnon, is wide of the mark. Naval analysts say the UK’s submarine fleet is already stretched and could not afford a sudden reduction. Australia will become the seventh country to have a nuclear-powered submarine, relying on an enriched uranium reactor, propulsion technology that will put the country’s diesel-powered navy on a technological par with China. But it will require Australia, which is not a nuclear power, to be supplied with a reactor, a move that Beijing has argued is a breach of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. The three Aukus powers say that is not the case, and that any reactors will be supplied “welded, shielded and sealed shut” according to Australian officials overseeing the effort. The new submarines will not carry nuclear weapons. But James Acton, a nuclear expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it was not yet clear how the nuclear waste generated by the propulsion reactors will be dealt with – and whether that will happen in Australia or the UK or US. Defence experts said the time it would take to build the new submarines meant that there may be some related short-term developments. The US is keen to be able to base its nuclear submarines in Australia, making it easier to patrol the South Pacific, as it seeks to retain naval parity with China. A UK government spokesperson said: “When we announced the Aukus partnership in September 2021 we said there would be an 18-month scoping period to determine the optimal path to procuring Australia nuclear-powered submarines. The outcome of the scoping period is due to be announced soon.” A No 10 spokesperson said they could not pre-empt any future announcements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-177-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T11:06:31Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 177 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-177-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-177-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 177 of the invasion","bodyText":"Rescuers are searching for survivors and victims under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, according to reports.

Fires and explosions have been reported at military targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, in the latest of a string of apparent sabotage missions deep into Russian-held territory. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a blaze at a munitions depot near the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province. “An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo”, less than 50km from the border, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement, adding that no casualties were reported.

According to Ukraine’s General Staff, Russia has lost 44,700 troops in Ukraine, as well as 1,899 tanks, 4,195 armoured fighting vehicles, 1,016 artillery systems, 266 multiple launch rocket systems, 141 air defence systems, 197 helicopters, 234 airplanes, 795 drones, and 15 boats, The Kyiv Independent reports. There were “no claimed or assessed Russian territorial gains in Ukraine” on Thursday for the first time since 6 July, a report by The Institute for the Study of War, has found. The report suggests Russian propaganda has been intensified as tensions continue to build around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russia has failed to make ground in the cyberspace battle against Ukraine, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence service has said. “President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the west,” Jeremy Fleming said in an op-ed in The Economist on Friday. “Just as with its land invasion, Russia’s initial online plans appear to have fallen short.” Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned. The US is readying about $800m of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” Jokowi, as he is popularly known, told the news agency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/14/uae-running-towards-renewable-future-says-oil-boss-cop28-president","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-14T16:08:50Z","webTitle":"UAE ‘running towards’ renewable future, says oil boss Cop28 president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/14/uae-running-towards-renewable-future-says-oil-boss-cop28-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/14/uae-running-towards-renewable-future-says-oil-boss-cop28-president","fields":{"headline":"UAE ‘running towards’ renewable future, says oil boss Cop28 president","bodyText":"The United Arab Emirates, the oil-rich Gulf nation that is hosting the next UN climate summit, is “running towards” a renewable energy future, the president of the summit has said. “The UAE has always made progress by getting ahead of the future,” said Sultan Al Jaber, who will oversee the Cop28 conference beginning this November, at an international meeting in Dubai on Tuesday. “We believe that gamechanging solutions can be achieved if the collective political will is there. It certainly is from the UAE. We in the UAE are not shying away from the energy transition. We are running towards it.” Al Jaber is also chief executive of the UAE’s national oil company, Adnoc, which has brought him under heavy fire from climate activists. Many prominent climate campaigning groups, and politicians including several US lawmakers, have called for him to step down from the oil company role. But Al Jaber told the World Government Summit, an annual meeting organised by the UAE in Dubai, that the country was working to “transform entire industrial systems that still run on the energies of the first Industrial Revolution”. He set out the case for the UAE’s presidency of the Cop28 summit, the fortnight-long meeting of heads of state and government that will begin on 30 November. At the conference, governments will be expected to report on how much progress they have made on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in line with the commitments of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change. This “global stocktake” is expected to show that far too little has been done to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the key aspiration set at Paris, and which scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst ravages of climate breakdown. Al Jaber said on Tuesday: “We don’t need to wait for the stocktake to find out what it will say. We already know that we are way off track. The world is playing catch-up when it comes to holding global temperatures down to 1.5C.” He called for much stronger action around the world. “We need to triple renewable energy capacity, double hydrogen production, expand nuclear power, improve battery storage and, if we are serious about capturing emissions, scale up carbon capture technologies. All while minimising the carbon intensity of the energy we use today,” he said. Investors must come forward with “lots of capital” to achieve these goals, Al Jaber said. “We need to ramp up investment across every area of decarbonisation and we should view these investments as an opportunity, not a burden,” he said. “In fact, economists estimate that decarbonising industry, the energy sector, power generation, transportation and food systems could create an additional $12tn in economic value by 2030.” In an implicit defence of his dual role, he added: “We have an unprecedented opportunity to engage the energy industry in a technological revolution that gets us to a climate-positive future. And yes, it is in our common interest to have the energy industry working hand in hand, and alongside everyone on the solutions that the world needs. That is just logical and makes sense.” Adnoc has benefited from the global oil and gas bonanza of the past year, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company’s drilling subsidiary, Adnoc Drilling, reported profits this week up by a third on last year. The company plans an expansion of its oil and gas production, which climate campaigners said ran counter to the Cop28 goal of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Marta Schaaf, the director of climate, economic and social justice at Amnesty International, said: “Sultan Al Jaber, the chief executive of Adnoc, one of the world’s largest oil and gas producers, plans to increase the group’s production of fossil fuels – this is entirely incompatible with his role as president designate of Cop28. [He] cannot be an honest broker for climate talks when the company he leads is planning to cause more climate damage.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/jan/11/heathrow-uranium-seizure-raises-questions-over-what-it-was-for","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-11T15:38:30Z","webTitle":"Uranium was embedded in metal bars seized at Heathrow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/11/heathrow-uranium-seizure-raises-questions-over-what-it-was-for","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jan/11/heathrow-uranium-seizure-raises-questions-over-what-it-was-for","fields":{"headline":"Uranium was embedded in metal bars seized at Heathrow","bodyText":"A discovery of metal bars embedded with uranium at Heathrow in late December has triggered an urgent counter-terrorism investigation, in an attempt to establish why it was concealed in an aeroplane shipment. Scotland Yard said on Tuesday night the amount of contaminated material was “extremely small” and posed “no threat to the public” although some reports had suggested, incorrectly, that several kilograms of uranium itself were discovered. The absence of danger was emphasised by multiple sources on Wednesday morning, although the way in which the uranium was discovered “in kilo bars” has raised questions whether there was a deliberate effort to conceal the presence of the radioactive element. Found by Border Force staff at Heathrow airport, the uranium was contained in a package of scrap metal that originally came from Pakistan and had come to the UK via a passenger flight from Oman on 29 December. It was bound for an Iranian business with premises in the UK. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, the former head of the British army’s chemical weapons unit, said he believed only trace amounts of uranium had been discovered and that it was unclear – “a million-dollar question” – what it could have been for. But the weapons expert said the public should not be concerned, not least because it was detected once it had arrived in the UK. “The system worked,” he added. Iran has been enriching uranium to 60% at two sites in the country, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, but denies any plan to develop a bomb, which requires uranium to be 90% enriched. Tehran also remains in long-running talks to restart an agreement in which it would curb its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief, but concerns about the country’s support for Russia make it unclear if a deal can be struck. Uranium is used as fuel in nuclear power stations and can be used for “dirty bombs” – munitions with a radioactive element – and certain types of nuclear weapons. But the Metropolitan police said its discovery did not appear to be linked with any active plot. “I want to reassure the public that the amount of contaminated material was extremely small and has been assessed by experts as posing no threat to the public,” said Commander Richard Smith of the Met. “Although our investigation remains ongoing, from our inquiries so far it does not appear to be linked to any direct threat. As the public would expect, however, we will continue to follow up on all available lines of inquiry to ensure this is definitely the case.” A Met spokesperson added: “We can confirm officers from the Met’s counter-terrorism command were contacted by Border Force colleagues at Heathrow after a very small amount of contaminated material was identified after routine screening within a package incoming to the UK on 29 December 2022.” It is understood that the Home Office does not believe there is any threat to the public. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not comment on live investigations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/23/uk-nuclear-waste-cleanup-decommissioning-power-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-23T10:40:13Z","webTitle":"UK’s nuclear waste cleanup operation could cost £260bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/23/uk-nuclear-waste-cleanup-decommissioning-power-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/sep/23/uk-nuclear-waste-cleanup-decommissioning-power-stations","fields":{"headline":"UK’s nuclear waste cleanup operation could cost £260bn","bodyText":"The cost of decommissioning the UK’s 20th-century nuclear waste could rise to £260bn as the aged and degrading sites present growing challenges, according to analysis presented to an international group of experts. As the government pursues nuclear energy with the promise of a new generation of reactors, the cost of safely cleaning up waste from previous generations of power stations is soaring. Degrading nuclear facilities are presenting increasingly hazardous and challenging problems. Ageing equipment and electrical systems at Sellafield, which is storing much of the country’s nuclear waste and is one of the most hazardous sites in the world, are increasing the risk of fire, according to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. They require increasing maintenance and present growing risk. Last October a faulty light fitting started a blaze at a Sellafield facility which led to its closure for several weeks. Analysis by Stephen Thomas, a professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, estimates the total bill for decommissioning the UK’s nuclear waste mountain will grow to £260bn. Thomas told a conference of international experts the cost of decommissioning Sellafield had risen from to £110bn, according to freedom of information requests. Other sites that need decommissioning are the 11 Magnox power stations, built between the 1950s and 1970s, including Dungeness A in Kent, Hinkley Point A in Somerset and Trawsfynydd in north Wales, and seven advanced gas-cooled reactors built from the 1960s to the 1980s, including Dungeness B, which closed last year, Hinkley Point B and Heysham 1 and 2 in Lancashire. Deterioration of one of the Magnox stations, Trawsfynydd, which shut down in 1991, is such that substantial work is needed to make it safe, according to the NDA. “Work that would then need to be undone to complete reactor dismantling,” the agency said. Thomas told the International Nuclear Risk Assessment Group similar problems are expected at other Magnox sites. The timetable for decommissioning the old nuclear power stations has been abandoned, with no new timescale yet published. The Nuclear Waste Service has said deferring decommissioning for 85 years from shutdown, which was previous policy, is not suitable for all the reactors because of their different ages and physical conditions. Decommissioning of some Magnox stations will have to be brought forward, the NWS has said. Attempts to speed up the decommissioning would only add to the growing bill, Thomas said, which he estimated had increased to £34bn. In 2005, the cost for decommissioning and disposing of the radioactive waste from nuclear power stations built in the 1950s, 70s and 90s was put at £51bn. Last year the NDA estimates rose to £131bn, and its latest annual report said £149bn was needed to pay for the clear up. But Thomas said rising costs meant the total bill was on track to reach £260bn. Part of the soaring increase is the cost of building a large underground nuclear waste dump or geological deposit facility (GDF) to safely store the 700,000 cubic metres of radioactive waste – roughly the volume of 6,000 double decker buses – from the country’s past nuclear programme. The mammoth engineering project was initially predicted to cost £11bn but the bill is now estimated to be up to £53bn because of uncertainty about where the site will be located, and the need to provide space for an unspecified amount of waste from the new generation of nuclear reactors which the government wants to build. Four areas of the country are being considered for the GDF but no decision on where it will be located has yet been made. “While we are clear about the current legacy of waste which already exists, a GDF would have to handle additional waste from new facilities being developed,” the NWService said. “The actual cost will … depend on the number of new nuclear projects that the UK develops in future and any additional waste from those stations.” The cleanup of past nuclear waste will take more than 100 years, the NDA has said. Highlighting the challenges of the degrading and hazardous facilities, the authority said in its annual report that robots and drones were increasingly being used to carry out site inspections. • This article was amended on 28 September 2022.

Photographs published on social media on Thursday showed a Pantsir missile system had been installed on the roof of an eight-story building used by the Russian defence ministry along the Moskva River. Another video showed the air defence system being lifted on to the roof of an education building in Moscow’s Taganka district, 1.5 miles south-east of the Kremlin. The short-to-medium-range systems are used to defend against aircraft, helicopters, and cruise missiles. The Russian military has also said they could be used against smaller targets, such as military and commercial drones, which have become ubiquitous on the battlefield since Vladimir Putin launched his wide-scale invasion in February. Images of the missile systems in Moscow emerged a day before western defence officials were set to meet at Ramstein airbase in Germany to agree on a new military aid package to Ukraine that could include the provision of heavy tanks. The US has already pledged nearly $2bn in further military aid to Ukraine, including a Patriot air sefence system meant to protect Ukrainian cities from Russian missiles. But Russian officials have issued warnings ahead of the meeting, attempting to dissuade Nato countries from providing more advanced weapons by claiming that these could potentially spark a nuclear conflict. “The defeat of a nuclear power in a conventional war can provoke the beginning of a nuclear war,” wrote Dmitry Medvedev, the former president, who has become a leading hawk as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council. Russian military officials did not immediately confirm the installation of the missile systems. However, several Russian media outlets have also reported on the deployment of long-range S-400 missile systems in Moscow in recent weeks. The S-400 and Pantsir-S1 systems are often used in tandem. The missile systems have appeared in the wake of a Russian bombing campaign that has used missiles and drones to target Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, leading to scores of deaths across the country. A Russian X-22 anti-ship ballistic missile hit an apartment block in the city of Dnipro last week, killing 45. Pro-Kremlin bloggers on Thursday said that the appearance of the missile systems in Moscow showed that the Russian military leadership was concerned now about attacks on their own cities. “It means that [the leadership] perfectly understand all the risks and understand that strikes against Moscow and the regions are just a question of time,” wrote Alexander Kots, a prominent Russian journalist who supports the Russian war in Ukraine. “It’s good to begin planning in advance instead of after the first strikes.” The appearance of the defensive missile systems highlights Russia’s lack of success in the war. Mysterious explosions have taken place at military sites in Crimea, and at several airbases used by Russian strategic bombers last month deep inside Russian territory. Ukrainian officials have also said they have begun testing long-range drones that can travel up to 1,000 km (621 miles), potentially putting Moscow in striking distance. “Russia has long given a very high priority to maintaining advanced ground-based air defences, but it is increasingly clear that it is struggling to counter air threats deep inside Russia,” the UK defence ministry wrote last year, a day after the explosions at Russia’s Engels airbase."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/24/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-274-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-24T00:37:26Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 274 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/24/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-274-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/24/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-274-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 274 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United Nations security council to act against Russia over air strikes on civilian infrastructure that have again plunged Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Russia unleashed a missile barrage across Ukraine on Wednesday, killing 10 people, forcing shutdowns of nuclear power plants and cutting water and electricity supply in many places. Neighbouring Moldova said it was suffering massive blackouts caused by the missile barrage and its EU-friendly president, Maia Sandu, accused Russia of leaving her country “in the dark”. European Union governments failed to reach a deal on Wednesday on the level at which to cap prices for Russian sea-borne oil under the G7 scheme and will resume talks, EU diplomats said. Earlier on Thursday, EU representatives met in Brussels. The move is part of sanctions intended to slash Moscow’s revenue from its oil exports so it has less money to finance the invasion of Ukraine. UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the UN security council on Wednesday that an exchange of 35 Russian and 36 Ukrainian prisoners was a positive development amid the “dark news” of Russian strikes on Ukraine. DiCarlo encouraged the parties to continue prisoner releases and follow international humanitarian law in relation to prisoners of war, Reuters reports. A Russian court on Wednesday extended by six months the detention of opposition politician Ilya Yashin, who risks being jailed for 10 years for denouncing president Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine. The 39-year-old Moscow city councillor is in the dock as part of an unprecedented crackdown on dissent in Russia, with most opposition activists either in jail or in exile. He faces up to 10 years behind bars, if convicted. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it had faith in the “success” of its offensive in Ukraine. “The future and the success of the special operation are beyond doubt,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on a visit to Armenia, using the official Moscow term to describe Russia’s assault, Agence France-Presse reports. European cities were urged to send spare generators to Ukraine to help the country through the winter in the face of Russia’s attacks on electricity infrastructure. Ukraine’s power grid came under bombardment again as the European parliament president, Roberta Metsola, launched an appeal to get generators to Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-393-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-23T10:59:24Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 393 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-393-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-393-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 393 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine’s state emergency services said on Thursday that it had ended rescue attempts in Rzhyshchiv, Kyiv region, where it is now known that nine people died in a suspected Russian drone attack in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that on Wednesday shelling in the Donetsk region killed two people and injured four others, while one person was killed and two were wounded in the Kherson region. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, said “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment”. He added that Russia is losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliia and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. The UK Ministry of Defence said that “Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres” in the Luhansk region, and that “Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node.” Any attempt to arrest President Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. A video is circulating on social media of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. Spain’s prime minister Pedro Sánchez said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with Chinese President Xi Jinping during an official visit to China next week. Estonia’s prime minister Kaja Kallas on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to squeeze Russia’s revenue more. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said Wednesday that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” following a Russian missile strike this month that disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia was a “journey of friendship, cooperation and peace”, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Wednesday, as China’s president ended his three-day visit to Moscow. Wang Wenbin reiterated Beijing’s claims that it remained neutral in the Ukraine conflict and said China would “continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political settlement of the Ukrainian issue”. Vladimir Putin has no immediate plans for peace in Ukraine, so the west needs to brace itself to supply lethal aid to Kyiv for a long time to come, Nato’s secretary general has warned in an interview with the Guardian. The fierce fighting, currently centred around Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, demonstrated Russia was willing “to just throw in thousands and thousands more troops, to take many casualties for minimal gains”, the head of Nato said. Russia’s foreign ministry has warned that Moscow will not leave “unanswered” a UK plan to supply Ukraine with tank shells made with depleted uranium. “This decision will not remain without serious consequences both for Russian-British bilateral relations and at the international level,” it said on Wednesday. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Britain’s decision took the situation to new and dangerous levels. The UK foreign secretary has said there is no “nuclear escalation” in the country’s decision to supply Ukraine with shells made with depleted uranium. “They are not nuclear munitions. They are purely conventional munitions,” James Cleverly said, a day after Vladimir Putin accused the west of “beginning to use weapons with a nuclear component”.

Avon and Somerset police said a significant number of police, fire and ambulance units attended the scene on the A39 Quantock Road near Bridgwater after receiving the first call at about 6am on Tuesday. A total of 54 patients were triaged at the scene, of whom 26 were treated as walking wounded, police said. Three people were freed from the bus using mechanical equipment, the fire service said. Police said a number of those treated at the scene were taken to Musgrove Park hospital in Taunton, Bridgwater minor injury unit, and 40 miles away to Bristol’s Southmead hospital. The incident came as temperatures plunged below zero, creating icy conditions on the roads. The energy firm EDF confirmed on Twitter that the bus was carrying members of the workforce at Hinkley Point C, the nuclear power station building site, nine miles from the site of the crash. Insp Rebecca Wells-Cole, of Avon and Somerset police, confirmed there had been no deaths. She said: “We were called to the A39 Quantock Road in Bridgewater following a report of a road-related incident involving a double-decker bus and a motorcyclist. We can now confirm the doubledecker bus was carrying 70 Hinkley Point C workers and the bus driver when it overturned. “The incident was initially declared as a major incident due to the number of people involved and the resources required. This has since been stood down.” Closures were in place at the junction of Sandford Hill and Quantock Road, police said. The Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service said: “Crews used hydraulic cutting equipment and small tools to extricate three casualties from the bus.” Ceri Smart, a strategic commander at the South Western ambulance service NHS foundation trust (SWASFT), said the service sent 23 ambulances, two critical care teams and two hazardous area response teams to the scene. The MP for Bridgwater and West Somerset, Ian Liddell-Grainger, called for the fullest investigation into the causes of the incident. “Obviously it was a terrifying experience for everyone on that bus and my thoughts are with them and their families,” he told the Bridgwater Mercury. “But we absolutely must get to the bottom of why this crash occurred because EDF is very conscious of the need to maintain the highest safety standards for the protection of their workers – and that concern naturally extends to those periods when they are being transferred to and from the site. “I am aware police have been reporting a high number of accidents in the area this morning, all of them blamed on icy road conditions. We need to establish as soon as we can whether similar circumstances played a role in this particular event.” A Somerset county council spokesperson said: “Our winter service team closely monitors the forecast in advance and all roads on Somerset’s precautionary gritting network are treated when temperatures are forecast to fall below zero. This is 21% of the county’s roads and includes all major routes. “All main routes were gritted yesterday afternoon before temperatures dropped and there was a further gritting operation across the county the following morning.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/03/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-02T18:00:21Z","webTitle":" What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

A bloody morass in Bakhmut Fighting around the key eastern Ukraine town of Bakhmut descended into a bloody morass with hundreds of dead and injured reported daily, Peter Beaumont reported, as neither Russian or Ukrainian forces are able to make a significant breakthrough after months of fighting. As Russia moved fresh formations to the area in recent weeks, including reinforcements previously in the Kherson region, the fighting in the Bakhmut sector has turned into trench warfare reminiscent of the first world war. Over the weekend, images emerged of Ukrainian soldiers in flooded, muddy trenches and battlefields dotted with the stumps of trees cut down by withering artillery barrages. The Ukrainian artists taking on Putin’s Russia Where to begin a story of war, Charlotte Higgins asked in her feature on Ukrainian artists this week. Every war teems with stories: of survival and violence, of resistance and compliance, of struggle and terror. They go together; many of the oldest stories that survive (the Iliad, the Odyssey) are stories of war and its aftermath. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a war full of stories but also a war about a story, about the accepted facts, about the prevailing narrative. Vladimir Putin’s “special operation”, as he calls it, seems to have been intended to provide a spectacle, a kind of war movie, for domestic consumption, drawing Russians together against what he hoped to frame as a common enemy – described variously as Nazis, terrorists or even, bizarrely, as the forces of Satan. At the same time, the war’s false justification has its own disturbing narrative, its own warped internal logic. Underlying Putin’s military aggression, as his speeches and essays have for years made clear, is his assertion that Ukraine has no distinct existence – that it can be seen only as an adjunct to Russia. In such a war on a nation’s culture, identity and history, it is artists and cultural figures who find themselves the crack troops of the resistance. The war is on one level about borders, and it is being fought with shells, Himars rocket launchers and Shahed-136 drones. But it is, on a deeper level, about culture. And, desperately holding the line, fighting on the cultural front, weaponising their work, are Ukraine’s artists. Fears for all Ukraine’s nuclear plants after emergency shutdowns There are growing fears that Russia’s relentless targeting of Ukraine’s electricity grid will threaten the safety of the country’s nuclear power plants, in the wake of an unprecedented emergency shutdown on Wednesday, Julian Borger reported. Petro Kotin, the president of Ukraine’s nuclear power company, Energoatom, said that all safety mechanisms had worked as intended on Wednesday, but two generators were damaged in the process, delaying the restart of two reactors. Kotin said repeated shutdowns caused by more Russian missile attacks could cause extensive damage, with a potentially severe impact on Ukraine’s power supply and possibly on nuclear safety. ‘Russia wins by losing’ Yale historian Timothy Snyder, who leads a crowdfunding campaign to raise $1.25m to fund an anti-drone system to detect enemy devices and jam signals, told Jennifer Rankin that it would be good for world peace if Russia lost the war. “Russia wins by losing. Russia really needs to lose this war, and to lose it decisively,” he said. “The whole colonial move towards Ukraine is a distraction, a substitute for the internal changes which Russia really has to make. “What European history really shows, and quite powerfully, is that in order to become, quote unquote, a ‘normal’ European country, you have to become post-imperial, [meaning] you have to lose your wars.” For this reason, he thinks meaningful negotiations can only take place once Ukraine has won the war. Russians are already signalling that negotiations are only a means “to regroup and attack again. And so I think we should probably listen to them when they say that.” Letter bombs in Spain Spain has ordered increased security at government buildings and embassies after the discovery of six letter bombs and incendiary devices over the past seven days, Sam Jones reported, including one that exploded at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid on Wednesday and another that was detected at the US embassy on Thursday. Devices have also been sent to the prime minister, the defence ministry, an arms company that makes rocket launchers donated to Kyiv, and a military airbase near the Spanish capital. Spain’s secretary of state for security said initial analysis suggested the packages had been sent from within Spain. “They’re similar-looking brown envelopes,” Rafael Pérez said in Madrid on Thursday. “We’re at the early stages of our investigation. While there are signs that they came from Spanish territory, let’s be prudent.” The defining images of war in winter The defining image of the current state of the war in Ukraine – and a metaphor for the entire country – is the snow-covered rubble of a residential building split in two by a Russian bomb in the town of Borodianka, Lorenzo Tondo and Julian Borger wrote this week. “Some people who lived in that building have died as a result of the conflict. Others have managed to escape, joining the great exodus of refugees toward Europe. Some are now living in a dormitory on the outskirts of the town, struggling, like millions of other Ukrainians, with the nightmare of what is expected to be the hardest winter in the country’s history since the second world war.” This week, Ukraine’s supplies of spare parts for its battered electricity grid were running out amid sustained Russian bombing. ‘Russia is trying to freeze us to death’ In a comment piece, the head of the Ukrainian presidential office, Andriy Yermak, wrote that his country was facing a new terror as Russia targeted its civilian energy infrastructure: death by freezing. “Have you ever tried to imagine mass death from freezing? Millions of slow, torturous, painful deaths – no movie or book can convey these horrors, either, and we don’t even want to try to imagine them.” But, he writes, Russia will fail. “Darkness will always be better than slavery. To stay free, we need further help from our friends and allies. Immediately. Now. Yesterday. We need reliable protection for our skies. We need resources to restore the power grids. We need generators to keep people warm while emergency workers repair broken infrastructure. In short, we need the light of hope.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-166-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T15:15:28Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 166 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-166-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-166-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 166 of the invasion","bodyText":"Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has accused Ukraine of taking “Europe hostage” over the situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The plant is occupied by Russian forces, and each side has claimed the other has caused damage to the complex by shelling it. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been seeking to inspect it. Zakharova said: “The leaders of the United Nations and the IAEA, over and over again, do not dare to directly name the source of the threat. They are demonstrating their unwillingness to point the finger at Kyiv.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”. The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near the plant after it was hit by shelling on Saturday night, causing one of the reactors to shut down and creating a “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is operating normally according to reports from Yevgeniy Balitsky, head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom called for the plant to be made a military-free zone, and said there should be a team of peacekeepers present at the site. Ukraine conducted long-range strikes on Russian troop bases and two key bridges across the Dnieper River overnight. The strikes hit the only two crossings Russia has to the pocket of southern Ukrainian territory it has occupied on the western bank of the river, said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command. “The results are rather respectable, hits on the Antonivskyi and Kakhovskyi bridges,” she said on television. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson told Interfax “The equipment of the builders who are repairing the Antonivskiy Bridge burned down, there are no critical damages. But the opening of the bridge is slightly delayed.” A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian soldier to 10 years in jail after finding him guilty of violating the laws and customs of war by firing a tank at a multi-story apartment block, an interior ministry official said. Ukraine has received its first three Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft systems from Germany and will use them to defend important infrastructure facilities, the southern military command has said. The Russian-installed head of southern Ukraine’s occupied Zaporizhzhia region signed on Monday a decree providing for a referendum on joining Russia. Zelenskiy said on Sunday that there could be no talks with Russia if it proceeds with referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine on joining Russia. Russian forces now hold large areas of territory in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday. Pope Francis welcomed the departure of the ships carrying grain from Ukrainian Black Sea ports saying this could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. Two more grain carrying ships have sailed from Ukraine’s Black sea ports on Monday, and the Polarnet, carrying 12,000 tons of Ukrainian corn, has arrived in Turkey. Russia is strengthening its positions and numbers on Ukraine’s southern front to ready itself for a Ukrainian counteroffensive and is likely to be preparing the ground to attack, according to British and Ukrainian military authorities. “Russian troops are almost certainly amassing in the south, either waiting for a Ukrainian counteroffensive or preparing to attack. Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, artillery and other things continue to move from the Donbas to the south-west,” the UK’s defence ministry said. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said if Russia were allowed to bully Ukraine, to invade and take territory without being opposed, then it would be “open season” around the world. The US’s top diplomat was speaking at a news conference alongside South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor. Pandor said no one in South Africa supported the war in Ukraine but that the prescripts of international law were not being applied evenly. “We should be equally concerned at what is happening to the people of Palestine, as we are with what is happening to the people of Ukraine,” she said. Russian shelling was recorded on Saturday in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern frontlines, according to the Ukrainian military. It also said Russian forces attempted to conduct assault in six different areas in the eastern Donetsk region, all of which failed to gain any territory and were held back by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine is investigating almost 26,000 suspected war crime cases committed since Russia’s invasion in February and has charged 135 people, its chief war crimes prosecutor told Reuters. Of those charged, approximately 15 are in Ukrainian custody and the remaining 120 remain at large. Finland has registered a record number of asylum seekers following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, beating a previous high set during the 2015 migrant crisis. Human rights group Amnesty International apologised for the “distress and anger” caused by a report that accused Ukraine of endangering civilians. The apology comes after Amnesty’s Ukraine head Oksana Pokalchuk said that she was resigning as she opposed the report’s publication, saying the human rights group unwittingly “created material that sounded like support for Russian narratives of the invasion”. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace welcomed a decision by Sweden to join countries contributing to the UK-led program to train Ukrainian personnel in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/08/antony-blinken-makes-surprise-visit-to-kyiv-promising-2bn-military-aid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T11:59:36Z","webTitle":"Ukraine has retaken 1,000 sq km of territory, Volodymyr Zelenskiy says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/08/antony-blinken-makes-surprise-visit-to-kyiv-promising-2bn-military-aid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/08/antony-blinken-makes-surprise-visit-to-kyiv-promising-2bn-military-aid","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine has retaken 1,000 sq km of territory, Volodymyr Zelenskiy says","bodyText":"Ukraine has retaken more than 1,000 sq km (390 sq miles) of territory and over 20 villages, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has announced, as its troops wage a counteroffensive in the south and the east of the country. Zelenskiy also released a video late on Thursday in which Ukrainian soldiers said they had taken the key eastern town of Balakliia, which has a population of 27,000 people. Earlier, Brig Gen Oleksiy Gromov said at a briefing that Ukrainian armed forces had advanced up to 50km (31 miles) into Russian lines and that “the total amount of territory returned to Ukrainian control in the Kharkiv and Pivdennyi Buh directions stands at more than 700 sq km”. Gromov said Ukrainian troops had advanced up to 3km on the Sloviansk front in the east and recaptured a settlement called Ozerne. This is the first time Kyiv has disclosed details of its recent counteroffensive since last week so as not to compromise the operation. The general singled out the role of Turkish-made Bayraktar drones. “Enemy infantry and motorised artillery units unprotected by air defence systems become easy prey for our Bayraktars, the quantity of which is always increasing, thanks to our volunteers,” he said. A top US general, Mark Milley, described the progress of Ukraine’s counteroffensive as “steady” and “deliberate”, and pointed in particular to the impact of US-supplied high-mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars) in supporting Ukraine’s advance. “We are seeing real and measurable gains from Ukraine in the use of these systems,” Gen Milley, the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, said in Ramstein, Germany. “For example, Ukrainians have struck over 400 targets with the Himars and they’ve had a devastating effect. “Russian lines of communication and supply channels are severely strained. It is having a direct impact on the Russian ability to project and sustain combat power. Russian command and control in their headquarters have been disrupted and they’re having great difficulty in supplying their forces and replacing their combat losses.” Milley and the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, were in Ramstein to meet their counterparts from about 50 countries to coordinate military support for Ukraine on a day when the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, announced another $2.8bn in arms supplies, both short- and long-term, for Ukraine and neighbouring states. A state department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the US package would “bolster the security of Ukraine and 18 of its neighbours, including … many of our Nato allies as well as other regional security partners”. Blinken made the arms announcement on a surprise visit to Kyiv. His arrival, which was not publicly expected until he landed, came after Zelenskiy, reported “good news” from the war’s frontlines. In a Wednesday evening address, Zelenskiy cited “the extremely successful hits in areas where the occupiers are concentrated”, and thanked Ukrainian artillery troops for what he said were successful strikes against Moscow’s forces in the south. Also on Wednesday, an official representing the Russian-controlled self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk confirmed that Ukraine had launched a surprise counterattack in the north-east Kharkiv region and “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. Unverified footage circulating on social media showed what looked like a Ukrainian soldier posing in front of an entrance sign for Balakliia. The US Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which follows the fighting in detail, said the Ukraine counterattack in the east drove Russian forces back to the north side of the Siverskyi Donets and Serednya Balakliika rivers and that Kyiv had retaken 400 sq km of territory in the east of the Kharkiv region. It appeared that Ukraine forces had also recaptured Verbivka and that Russian forces may have destroyed bridges to prevent Ukrainian fighters from pursuing them, ISW said. “Russia’s deployment of forces from Kharkiv and eastern Ukraine to Ukraine’s south is likely enabling Ukrainian counterattacks of opportunity,” it said. The long-awaited counteroffensive came at a crucial moment in the conflict. After months in which Ukraine’s fate seemed sealed, with Moscow cornering Ukraine in the Donbas and threatening to advance towards Odesa, the reconquest of territory by the Ukrainian armed forces seems to have raised the morale of the people, who are resigned to a conflict that could last for years. “Each success of our military in one direction or another changes the general situation along the entire frontline in favour of Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said. “The more difficult it is for the occupiers, the more losses they have, the better the positions of our defenders in Donbas will be.” The Ukrainian counteroffensive in the east does not seem to have stopped the Russian bombing in the city of Kharkiv. On Thursday, the regional governor of Kharkiv, Oleh Synehubov, said two people were killed and five were injured in Russian shelling in the city’s industrial district. Ukraine’s commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Gen Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, gave a detailed assessment of the war to date in rare public comments published on Wednesday and warned of the threat of Russia using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which would create the risk of a “limited” nuclear conflict with other powers, according to an opinion piece attributed in his name in Ukraine’s state news agency Ukrinform. Zaluzhnyi said the “direct threat” of Russia’s possible use of tactical nuclear weapons had had a major influence on the adoption of relevant decisions. “Another factor is the direct threat of the use by Russia, under certain circumstances, of tactical nuclear weapons,” he said. “Battles on the territory of Ukraine have already demonstrated how much the Russian Federation neglects the issues of global nuclear security even in a conventional war. It is hard to imagine that even nuclear strikes will allow Russia to break Ukraine’s will to resist. But the threat that will emerge for the whole of Europe cannot be ignored.” Heavy fighting was raging on Thursday in areas near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in Ukraine after Kyiv said it may have to shut down the plant to avoid disaster. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in its daily update that some villages and communities near the plant were heavily shelled in the 24 hours to Thursday morning from “tanks, mortars, barrel and jet artillery”. The occupation of the nuclear power plant has prompted fears of a nuclear disaster as both sides trade blame for shelling the site. On Wednesday, the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, who was in Rome for a meeting with the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, told La Repubblica newspaper that he was moved when he visited the plant. When asked what he thought about Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy, who accused him of not saying who was to blame for the strikes on the plant, Grossi replied: “Being a judge, the referee between two contenders, is not my mandate. Indeed, if it was, it would cancel my utility as guarantor of the safety of the nuclear power plant.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/sep/16/morning-mail-nuclear-powered-submarine-deal-nsw-vaccination-law-pentecostal-churchs-jobkeeper-windfall","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-15T21:09:04Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: nuclear-powered submarine deal, NSW vaccination law, Pentecostal church’s jobkeeper windfall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/16/morning-mail-nuclear-powered-submarine-deal-nsw-vaccination-law-pentecostal-churchs-jobkeeper-windfall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/sep/16/morning-mail-nuclear-powered-submarine-deal-nsw-vaccination-law-pentecostal-churchs-jobkeeper-windfall","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: nuclear-powered submarine deal, NSW vaccination law, Pentecostal church’s jobkeeper windfall","bodyText":"Good morning. There’s breaking news this morning about a major new security partnership between Australia, the US and the UK, which has big ramifications for the Morrison government’s submarine acquisition plans. There are plenty of Covid updates as well, while a Pentecostal church’s jobkeeper windfall has attracted attention. Australia will get new nuclear-powered submarines under a security partnership with the US and UK aimed at confronting China. The initiative, called Aukus, was announced jointly by President Joe Biden and prime ministers Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison, after US briefings that described the agreement as binding the three English-speaking countries together. The deal is expected to mean the Morrison government will pull out of a $90bn contract with the French shipbuilder Naval Group. Australia had planned to acquire 12 new Attack-class submarines, with the first set to become operational in 2034, but Australia’s biggest defence acquisition has been plagued by delays, cost blowouts and disputes over local industry involvement. Resistance to the NSW government’s push to make dining or shopping conditional upon full vaccination will find no support from the law, a legal expert has warned, as business leaders vow to flout the mandatory double-dose vaccination requirement. The absence of a Human Rights Act in NSW offers almost no scope for discrimination on the basis of vaccine preferences, Dr Ron Levy said, meaning the legal prospects for those seeking to push back against the move were “quite poor”. Health workers across Victoria, the ACT and NSW are working shifts of up to 16 hours, with more than 2,000 frontline staff now in isolation. There are 1,190 health workers in NSW who are unavailable due to infection or exposure to Covid, with the nurse’s association’s Brett Holmes saying remaining staff “are working extraordinarily hard” to meet shortfalls. A crisis in country nursing homes is also leaving thousands of families stranded, with more than half of homes still losing money despite receiving Covid-related government funding. And Australians are self-reporting greater negativity about the future compared with during the first pandemic wave, according to national wellbeing survey. Australia A phytoplankton bloom larger than the entire Australian continent was sparked by the 2019-20 bushfires, researchers have revealed. Heavily reliant on iron traces carried by smoke particles far across the ocean, the blooms lasted several months. A leading Pentecostal church has posted a $1.2m increase in revenue after receiving $660,000 in jobkeeper payments. Hope Unlimited church saw its revenues grow from $2.8m to $4m during 2020, and accepted the public payouts despite eligibility for the scheme depending upon a forecasted decline of 15% in revenue. Scott Morrison has advised Christian Porter he wants the controversy surrounding his acceptance of funds from an unknown source resolved. The industry minister revealed this week that part of his defamation legal fees were paid by a blind trust.

And while it’s spring in Australia, that shouldn’t stop you from enjoying a delicacy from the Chinese autumn harvest calendar. But what are mooncakes? Jess Ho provides the details: “To explain it in the simplest, possible way, it’s a small, round pastry stuffed with either sweet or savoury filling. There are many different variations of the mooncake, depending on where in Asia you’re from – the only common element being the symbolism of the moon.” “It seems there have always been two NSWs – Sydney, and the rest of us.” Whether it’s forced council amalgamations, fire disaster response, or now, Covid vaccinations, as Tom Plevey argues, regional NSW is always the last to get a look in. “New South Wales has been set up to run off the image of Sydney and, if Sydney is looking good, then the whole state must be good, and with the concentration of power – political, social, corporate, media – in the Harbour City it’s been an easy facade to maintain.” Australian house prices are going up faster than ever before. In scenes last seen just before the global financial crisis, homes in cities including Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra have seen hikes of 15% to 20% in the past year alone. But one man is sick of being blamed for the phenomenon, Greg Jericho explains, and that’s the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe.

Scientists mostly only counted the rise of the oceans because of expansion of warmer water then added on melting glaciers in the Alps and other temperate regions. Originally ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica were excluded, in case increased snow fall in winter was greater than the ice melt in summer. Real time measurements of ice lost in polar regions has changed that. Coastal inundation in places such as East Anglia, Florida, and the Nile and Mekong deltas is expected to be far worse and quicker than previously predicted. Food supplies are threatened. The melting is also irreversible. This makes Boris Johnson’s last act as prime minister to back a giant nuclear power plant on a low lying coast at Sizewell in Suffolk look a gamble. The builders, EDF, say there is no danger because the twin reactors will be built on a concrete raft seven metres above mean sea level, with a further surrounding wall to protect the nuclear island. But this concrete monolith will need to withstand sea level rise and storm surges for up to 200 years to protect future generations from its radioactive content."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/apr/02/ryuichi-sakamoto-japanese-pop-pioneer-and-oscar-winning-composer-dies-aged-71","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-02T13:53:54Z","webTitle":"Ryuichi Sakamoto, Japanese pop pioneer and Oscar-winning composer, dies aged 71","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/02/ryuichi-sakamoto-japanese-pop-pioneer-and-oscar-winning-composer-dies-aged-71","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/apr/02/ryuichi-sakamoto-japanese-pop-pioneer-and-oscar-winning-composer-dies-aged-71","fields":{"headline":"Ryuichi Sakamoto, Japanese pop pioneer and Oscar-winning composer, dies aged 71","bodyText":"Ryuichi Sakamoto, the Japanese musician whose remarkably eclectic career straddled pop, experimentalism and Oscar-winning film composition, has died aged 71. Sakamoto’s management company said he died on Tuesday. He had been undergoing treatment for cancer. As a member of Yellow Magic Orchestra alongside Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, Sakamoto created joyous and progressive electronic pop in the late 1970s and early 1980s, alongside solo releases. He acted alongside David Bowie in the 1983 film Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence and composed its celebrated theme, the first in a series of film scores including Oscar-winning work in 1987 with David Byrne and Cong Su for Bernardo Bertolucci’s The Last Emperor. Sakamoto had twice been diagnosed with cancer. In 2014, he took a year off from music as he recovered from throat cancer, describing the illness as “the most harsh, physically painful time in my life”. In January 2021, he announced he had been diagnosed with bowel cancer, saying: “From now on, I will be living alongside cancer. But, I am hoping to make music for a little while longer.” He was born in Tokyo in 1952, and began taking piano lessons aged six, later attending Tokyo University of the Arts to study music. He trained on early synthesisers, and enthused by everything from Debussy to Kraftwerk, began working on various musical projects, including with Hosono and Takahashi. After Sakamoto released his 1978 solo debut, Thousand Knives – playing melodies that harked back to traditional Japanese music on electronic equipment – the trio realised their vision for a Japanese disco-pop group, Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO). The group became a huge success in Japan – in 1980, two of their albums stayed at No 1 and No 2 in the charts for seven weeks, and they had seven Top 5 albums during their career. “Accidentally the three of us became very popular,” he remembered in 2018. “Walking the street in Tokyo, people pointed at me. I hated it.” Their English-language lyrics helped them cross over into the US, where they appeared on the TV show Soul Train, and their electronic production influenced early hip-hop and electro scenes. Michael Jackson covered their song Behind the Mask and intended to include it on Thriller, but a royalties disagreement prevented it. Their track Computer Game was also a Top 20 hit in the UK. YMO went on hiatus in 1984, though occasionally reunited for releases and reunion concerts. Alongside YMO, Sakamoto continued releasing solo albums including 1980’s B-2 Unit, another influence on the robotically funky sound of electro that also foreshadowed other dance music styles. After focusing purely on solo work, he forged further connections in the west, collaborating with musicians including Iggy Pop, Robert Wyatt, Laurie Anderson, David Sylvian and more. Sylvian contributed Forbidden Colours, a vocal version of one of Sakamoto’s most famous works, the theme to second world war drama Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence. Sakamoto also starred in the film as a prisoner of war camp commander. Following The Last Emperor (in which he also had an acting role), he collaborated with Bernardo Bertolucci again for The Last Buddha, and with Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence director Nagisa Oshima for Gohatto. He also scored two films by Brian De Palma (Snake Eyes and Femme Fatale), plus Wild Palms for Oliver Stone, High Heels for Pedro Almodóvar, the 1990 film adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale, and more. His 2015 score for Alejandro González Iñárritu’s film The Revenant was nominated for Golden Globe, Bafta and Grammy awards. In 2019, he composed the music for an episode of dystopian TV drama series Black Mirror. He took no further acting roles, aside from appearing as a film director in Rain, a music video for Madonna. Sakamoto released a steady schedule of solo releases throughout the 1990s and onwards, and wrote a piece for the opening ceremony of the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. In 1999 he debuted the multimedia opera project Life, in collaboration with artist Shiro Takatani with contributions from Bertolucci, Pina Bausch and more. He and Takatani extended the concept into installation work from 2007 onwards. Also in 2007, he began the ambitious Schola project, curating 17 compilations of global music ranging from composers such as Ravel and Beethoven to Japanese pop. It was released via his record label Commmons, set up in 2006, which has also released work by artists including Boredoms and OOIOO. In 2002, he began a fruitful partnership with German musician Carsten Nicolai, who used his Alva Noto alias for four collaborative albums of minimalist electronica. Sakamoto was also an environmental campaigner, opposing the use of nuclear power, and creating the forestry project More Trees to enable carbon offsetting. In 1982, Sakamoto married Japanese pop musician Akiko Yano, a touring member of YMO and a successful solo artist in her own right. They split in 1992, and eventually filed for divorce in 2006. They had a daughter, pop singer Miu Sakamoto. Since the early 1990s, Sakamoto has been in a relationship with Norika Sora. Their son Neo Sora contributed to a documentary, Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda, directed by Stephen Nomura Schible in 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-345-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-03T15:10:25Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 345 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-345-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-345-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 345 of the invasion","bodyText":"President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday Ukraine would fight to hold on to the eastern “fortress” city of Bakhmut for as long as it could, and urged the west to supply long-range weapons to help Kyiv push Russian forces out of the Donbas region. “Nobody will give away Bakhmut. We will fight for as long as we can. We consider Bakhmut our fortress,” Zelenskiy told a news conference with top European Union officials following a summit in Kyiv. “Ukraine would be able to hold Bakhmut and liberate occupied Donbas if it received long-range weapons,” he said. Senior EU officials including the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Council president, Charles Michel, and 15 European commissioners travelled to the Ukrainian capital for talks. Air raid sirens twice sounded across Ukraine on Friday as President Zelenskiy hosted EU leaders in Kyiv. The first air alert in Kyiv was on Friday morning. The second, hours later, followed a joint news conference involving Zelenskiy, von der Leyen and Michel. There were no immediate reports of any Russian airstrikes on Kyiv throughout the day. EU leaders offered strong support for Ukraine but set “no rigid timelines” for its accession to the bloc. President Zelenskiy had hoped the EU would put Ukraine on a rapid track to membership, but western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv’s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. “There are no rigid timelines, but there are goals that you have to reach,” von der Leyen told the news conference. President Zelenskiy appealed to the EU to impose sanctions on Russia’s state-run nuclear monopoly Rosatom and its top managers. Zelenskiy said during talks with EU leaders on Friday that they had discussed “the extension of the energy sanctions to cover the nuclear sphere”. He argued sanctions should target Rosatom and its managers, whom he accused of the seizure and forced nationality change of staff at Ukrainian nuclear power facilities and their children. The EU has promised a 10th package of sanctions against Russia will be in place by 24 February, the first anniversary of the war. Speaking alongside Zelenskiy, Ursula von der Leyen said the package would cover trade worth €10bn and focus on technology used by the Russian military, such as drone components, as well as measures to counter circumvention of sanctions. The next round of EU sanctions, however, is not expected to include nuclear power, which Hungary has already threatened to block. Zelenskiy had called on Thursday for more punitive EU measures against Russia, but new sanctions the bloc is preparing will fall short of his government’s demands. “We see today that the pace of sanctions in Europe has slowed down a little,” Zelenskiy said at a news conference. “The terrorist state increases the pace of adaptation to sanctions instead. It should be resolved. We believe that we can do it together.” Maria Zakharova, a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, responded to the Ukrainian president’s comments by saying: “Western Europe, falling into recession, having long lost the habit of survival, is sinking, with Ukraine tied to its feet.” EU member countries have agreed on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products, the Swedish presidency of the EU said. Ambassadors of the 27 EU states agreed at a meeting to impose a $100-per-barrel cap on premium products such as diesel and a $45 cap on low-end products, according to diplomats. The price cap comes into effect on Sunday, as does the EU’s ban on Russian oil product imports. The US has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $2.175bn (£2.2bn). The package will include precision-guided rockets and HAWK air-defence firing units, as well as other munitions and weapons, the US state department said. Significantly, it includes the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) for the first time, which will double Ukraine’s strike range and allow Ukraine’s military to strike deep behind the frontlines of the war. France and Italy have finalised technical talks for the joint delivery of the SAMP/T air defence system to Ukraine in spring 2023, the French defence ministry announced. It comes after Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said on Thursday that the SAMP/T system would be operational in Ukraine “within seven to eight weeks”. The system can track dozens of targets and intercept 10 at once. It is the only European-made system that can intercept ballistic missiles. The EU has pledged to double a military aid programme for Ukraine by training an extra 15,000 soldiers, as part of a blizzard of announcements aimed at showing it will “stand by Ukraine for the long haul”. The EU will launch a humanitarian de-mining programme in Ukraine worth €25m, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, confirmed. De-mining is “crucial to save the lives of civilian population”, Borrell said. The EU will also supply Ukraine with 35m LED lightbulbs, 2,400 generators on top of 3,000 already delivered and promised funding for solar panels to power Ukraine’s public buildings. The prosecutor general’s office of Ukraine has pressed criminal charges against Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. Prigozhin has been charged with encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine and of waging a war of aggression against Ukraine. There are reports that one person was killed in a car bomb explosion in occupied Enerhodar, in Zaporizhzhia region. Dmitri Orlov, Ukraine’s mayor of the city, claimed the victim was a former Ukrainian police officer who had defected to help the authorities in the area of Ukraine that the Russian Federation has claimed to annex The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday morning that the war would continue in Ukraine as Donbas was not “fully protected yet”. Germany has approved a delivery of Leopard 1 main battle tanks to Ukraine from industrial stocks, government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit has said. Hebestreit confirmed “an export licence has been issued” for the delivery by a private arms-marker of its older Leopard 1 tanks, but did not provide further details. Germany is also understood to be in the process of preparing a joint weapons package with Sweden in which Stockholm would provide air-defence missiles and launching platforms for Germany’s Iris-T systems. Robert Habeck, the German deputy chancellor and economic minister, discussed this joint package in a meeting with the Swedish minister for foreign trade, Johan Forssell, during a state visit on Thursday, one government official said. Germany will not play a “key” role in the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv because “it is American technology”, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said. In an interview with BBC News Ukraine, Kuleba said he had “no doubt” that the decision to supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets would be made, adding that Kyiv was “open to communication with all partners” on aircraft such as the Swedish Gripens, French Mirages and Rafales. Russian-installed authorities in Crimea said on Friday they had nationalised about 500 properties in the peninsula, including some belonging to senior Ukrainian politicians and business figures. Nato has called on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the Start nuclear reductions treaty. Norway will order 54 new German-made Leopard tanks for its army from the KraussMaffei Group, the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported on Friday. Traders are using Turkey, Kazakhstan and Armenia to evade European Union sanctions on Russia in a tactic that breaches these countries’ compliance with the bloc’s embargo, Latvia’s prime minister said. The EU said on Thursday it intended to work with Ukrainian prosecutors to set up an international centre for the prosecution of the crime of aggression in Ukraine, to be located in The Hague. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said on Thursday that sending fighter jets to Ukraine would require “months if not years” of training and that he was looking for the most effective way of helping Kyiv secure victory. The head of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games has said it is for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to decide whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete in the Games next year. Russia is planning a major offensive to coincide with the one-year anniversary of its invasion on 24 February, according to Ukraine’s defence minister. Speaking to French media, Oleksii Reznikov said Russia would call on a large contingent of mobilised troops. Referring to the general mobilisation of 300,000 conscripted soldiers in September, he claimed that numbers at the border suggest the true size could be closer to 500,000. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday that everybody wanted the conflict in Ukraine to end, but that the west’s support for Kyiv was playing an important role in how Moscow approached the campaign. A senior Russian lieutenant who fled after serving in Ukraine has described how his country’s troops tortured prisoners of war and threatened some with rape. “I have personally seen our troops torture Ukrainian soldiers,” Konstantin Yefremov, who is the most senior soldier to speak out against the war, told the Guardian in a phone call. “I feel relieved that I can finally speak out about the things I have seen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/07/peter-dutton-says-labors-renewable-energy-overhaul-plan-never-going-to-be-realised","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-07T00:48:48Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton says Labor’s renewable energy overhaul plan ‘never going to be realised’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/07/peter-dutton-says-labors-renewable-energy-overhaul-plan-never-going-to-be-realised","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/07/peter-dutton-says-labors-renewable-energy-overhaul-plan-never-going-to-be-realised","fields":{"headline":"Peter Dutton says Labor’s renewable energy overhaul plan ‘never going to be realised’","bodyText":"Peter Dutton has declared Labor’s proposal to overhaul the energy grid to boost the share of renewable generation “is never going to be realised” and says Tim Flannery ought to apologise for past statements about the link between global heating and extreme weather. During an appearance on Andrew Bolt’s program on Sky News on Thursday night, the opposition leader characterised Labor’s Rewiring the Nation program as a “pipe dream”. Dutton’s response followed Bolt declaring the “new religion” of global warming had prompted the Albanese government to adopt “frankly unbelievable and dangerous targets like making us buy electric cars, half of all new car sales by 2030 … [and] making 83% of our electricity come from unreliable renewable energy”. Bolt also raised a comment made in 2007 by Flannery, then the climate change commissioner, about global heating resulting in less rainfall over the long term before declaring “Sydney has today recorded the most annual rainfall ever, its wettest year ever”. The broadcaster asked Dutton what he concluded from this. The opposition leader responded: “Well, that Tim Flannery was dead wrong, so I presume he’ll come out and apologise for the mistake, but I wouldn’t hold your breath for that, Andrew.” What Flannery said in 2007 was, and remains, consistent with what climate science says about global heating leading to more extreme weather, like floods, droughts and bushfires. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dutton told Bolt rather than talking about transforming the infrastructure of Australia’s power grid to ensure more power can be generated reliably from low-emissions sources, Australia needed to consider nuclear energy. “I mean, we’ve started this debate on nuclear power in our country,” Dutton told Bolt. “It’s absurd that in the year 2022 we can’t be talking about safe new technology in the form of the small modular reactors, and France, Canada, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and many other countries have either adopted or are considering the adoption of nuclear power to firm up the renewables in the system. “We’re talking in Europe at the moment about a catastrophic winter where people are going to either feed themselves or turn on their heaters, but they’re not going to be able to afford to do both. “So, power prices will continue to go through the roof in our country whilst Labor pursues their zealot-like approach.” A range of studies are clear that nuclear energy is one of the most expensive forms of power generation and renewables the cheapest. Earlier this year, the CSIRO found wind and solar generation are “the cheapest source of electricity generation and storage in Australia, even when considering additional integration costs arising due to the variable output of renewables, such as energy storage and transmission”. The CSIRO examined the viability of small modular nuclear reactors through a consultation process with Australia’s electricity sector and concluded there was no prospect “of domestic projects this decade, given the technology’s commercial immaturity and high cost”. The CSIRO noted future cost reductions were possible in time, but that depended “on its successful commercial deployment overseas”. Dutton was part of a government that signed the Paris agreement, which commits developed and developing countries to limit their emissions to relatively safe levels of 2C with an aspiration of 1.5C, with regular reviews to ensure these commitments can be increased in line with scientific advice. Climate science suggests Australia cannot afford to wait for a decade to see whether small modular reactors are economically feasible and can be deployed at scale. According to the latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025 and can be nearly halved this decade, which would give the world a chance of limiting future heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. On the Bolt program on Thursday night, Dutton said he was “happy to see renewables in the system, but it needs to be firmed up and if you don’t like coal and gas and you don’t believe hydrogen’s coming any time soon and hydro is not going to fit the bill, what are you left with?” In 2021, the International Energy Agency said if the world was to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050, there must be no new oil and gas development and no new coal-fired power stations built. The Liberal party has lost the electorates of Warringah, North Sydney, Mackellar, Goldstein, Kooyong and Curtin over the past two federal election cycles in part because voters are concerned about the Coalition’s failure to act on climate change. Despite this wipe-out in the party’s metropolitan heartland, Dutton resolved after he took the opposition leadership that he would oppose Labor’s 2030 emissions reduction target of 43%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/25/much-of-ukraine-without-power-heat-and-water-after-missile-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-25T14:44:41Z","webTitle":"Much of Ukraine still without power, heat and water after missile attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/25/much-of-ukraine-without-power-heat-and-water-after-missile-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/25/much-of-ukraine-without-power-heat-and-water-after-missile-attacks","fields":{"headline":"Much of Ukraine still without power, heat and water after missile attacks","bodyText":"Much of Ukraine remained without electricity, heat and water two days after a devastating series of Russian missile attacks against the country’s civilian infrastructure. The Kyiv mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said 60% of households in the city of 3 million had no power, and there were rolling blackouts around the country, as engineers struggled to repair transformers and transmission lines damaged or destroyed by cruise missiles on Wednesday. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said basic utilities were gradually being restored, but there were problems with water supplies in 15 regions. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said Russian strikes on critical infrastructure had killed at least 77 people since October. “Millions are being plunged into extreme hardship and appalling conditions of life by these strikes,” said Türk in a statement. “Taken as a whole, this raises serious problems under international humanitarian law, which requires a concrete and direct military advantage for each object attacked.” The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, did not deny that Russia was attacking Ukraine’s energy infrastructure but blamed Kyiv on the grounds it had not bowed to Russian demands, which he did not specify. Zelenskiy’s government has vowed not to accept peace terms that leave Russia in control of any Ukrainian territory. In his nightly address on Thursday, Zelenskiy said the attacks would not break the will of the Ukrainian population. “Together we endured nine months of full-scale war and Russia has not found a way to break us, and will not find one,” he said. The three nuclear power stations still under Ukrainian control were back in operation after an unprecedented complete shutdown on Wednesday. However, Petro Kotin, the head of the state nuclear energy company, Energoatom, told the Guardian that defects in turbogenerators meant that two reactors were not yet rejoined the power grid. Kotin did not say where the two affected reactors were. Kotin said that in the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which remains under Russian control, two of the six reactors were in standby mode, but had not yet been returned to the grid. Russian forces have continued to shell the southern city of Kherson two weeks after withdrawing their troops to the other side of the Dnipro River. Ukrainian citizens being evacuated from the city because of the complete destruction of electricity, heat and water systems, have come under artillery fire as they attempt to leave.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said basic utilities were gradually being restored, but there were problems with water supplies in 15 regions. The EU will intensify efforts to provide Ukraine with support to restore and maintain power and heating, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said. In a statement after a phone call with Zelenskiy, she said the EU would provide 200 medium-sized transformers and a large autotransformer from Lithuania, a medium-sized autotransformer from Latvia and 40 heavy generators from the EU reserve in Romania. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said Russian strikes on critical infrastructure had killed at least 77 people since October. Since early October, Russian forces have launched missiles roughly once a week with the aim of destroying the Ukrainian energy grid, crippling the country’s power and heat supply. Hospital patients are being evacuated from Kherson city because of bombardment by Russian forces, said the governor of the region, Yaroslav Yanushevych. The recently recaptured city in the south of the country faced heavy shelling last night. Russian strikes damaged a hospital in Zaporizhzhia overnight, the region’s governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said. The attacks come as Russia’s latest barrage shut down all of Ukraine’s nuclear plants – one of which is located in Zaporizhzhia – for the first time in 40 years. All nuclear power stations in the government-controlled part of Ukraine are up and running again and connected to the main electricity grid, the country’s energy provider, Ukrenergo, has said. The UN’s nuclear watchdog confirmed that Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants had been reconnected to the national power grid after completely losing off-site power earlier this week. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has met a handpicked cadre of mothers of soldiers fighting in Ukraine in a carefully staged encounter meant to calm public anger over mobilisation. While dozens of ordinary mothers have gone public saying they were snubbed by the Kremlin, Putin sat down with a former government official, the mother of a senior military and police official from Chechnya, and other women active in pro-war NGOs financed by the state. The Russian war effort in Ukraine is characterised by confusion among reservists over eligibility for service and inadequate training and equipment, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence. In its daily update, the MoD said some reservists were having to serve with “serious chronic health conditions” since they were called up during Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilisation”. Armenia has asked the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to chair peace talks with Azerbaijan in a fresh challenge to Vladimir Putin’s increasingly loose grip on Russia’s regional allies in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The snub from a traditional ally to Putin comes immediately on the back of his disastrous summit with six former Soviet states. EU diplomats are meeting this evening to resume talks on whether they can finalise a deal on a price level to cap Russian oil exports, according to a report by Bloomberg. European governments have failed so far to reach a deal on the price level for Russian oil. A G7 proposal for a cap of $65-$70 a barrel is seen as far too high by some, and too low by others. Germany’s Bundestag is planning to pass a resolution declaring the starvation of millions of Ukrainians under Joseph Stalin a genocide. The resolution, which will be jointly brought to the vote next week by the three governing parties and conservative opposition leaders, aims to serve as a warning to Moscow as Ukraine faces a potential hunger crisis this winter. Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, travelled to Kyiv on Thursday to meet the Ukrainian leadership and promise the UK’s support for as long as it takes. In his first visit to Ukraine since his appointment as foreign secretary, Cleverly presented a package of support including money for the reconstruction of schools, ambulances, the victims of sexual violence, and grain sales to the world’s poorest markets, such as Sudan and Yemen. Two Swedish brothers, one who worked for the country’s security police and armed forces, went on trial in Stockholm today accused of spying for Russian intelligence between 2011 and 2021. Payam Kia, 35, and his brother Peyman Kia, 42, could face life sentences if found guilty. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has met mothers of Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. Around a table laid with tea, cakes and bowls of fresh berries, he told them he shared in their suffering and the entire Russian leadership understood the pain of those who had lost their sons. Advocates of soldiers’ families and rights groups have said Putin snubbed them for the meeting. Valentina Melnikova, who has been an advocate for soldiers’ families for more than three decades, told the Guardian that “they didn’t invite us and we of course don’t want to go”. A Swedish court has ordered a man to be remanded in custody on suspicion of illegal intelligence activities against Sweden and a foreign power. The man, who has Russian roots, was arrested by police on Tuesday morning after a raid on a house in an affluent Stockholm suburb, Reuters reports. The suspected crimes were said to have taken place between July 2014 until the day of the arrest. Prosecutors said a second person arrested in Tuesday’s raid had been released but remained a suspect. Both have denied any wrongdoing. The UN’s nuclear watchdog has confirmed that Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants have been reconnected to the national power grid after completely losing off-site power earlier this week. In a statement, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it had been informed by Ukraine that its Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyi plants had been reconnected. Power had also been restored to the Chernobyl site, it said. Ukraine’s nuclear energy firm, Energoatom, said on Wednesday that a number of units were shut down at the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear plant in southern Ukraine because of a loss of power during Russian airstrikes. Units were also not operating at the Khmelnytskyi plant in western Ukraine, according to a local official. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has also tweeted about his call with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and said the pair discussed cooperation on ensuring energy stability for his country. The EU will intensify efforts to provide Ukraine with support to restore and maintain power and heating, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said after a phone call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In a statement, she said the EU was preparing the delivery to Ukraine “as quickly as possible” of large donations from the bloc’s member states and from the commission’s reserves. She said the EU would provide 200 medium-sized transformers and a large autotransformer from Lithuania, a medium-sized autotransformer from Latvia and 40 heavy generators from the EU reserve in Romania. Each of these generators “can provide uninterrupted power to a small to medium-sized hospital”, she said. She added that she expressed the EU’s “full solidarity” with the Ukrainian people at the hands of Vladimir Putin’s “deliberate and barbaric bombing” of the country’s civilian infrastructure during her call with Zelenskiy. Two Swedish brothers, one who worked for the country’s security police and armed forces, went on trial in Stockholm today accused of spying for Russian intelligence between 2011 and 2021. Payam Kia, 35, and his brother Peyman Kia, 42, were detained last year on suspicion of providing the Russian intelligence agency, GRU, with classified information over a period of a decade. Prosecutors say the older brother is also charged with gross unauthorised handling of secret information. According to Swedish media, he previously worked for the Office for Special Information Gathering (KSI), the most secret section of the military secret service. Both men have previously denied all allegations. In his opening statement, the prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist told the court: This case is unique in many ways … We haven’t had a trial like this in more than 20 years. He said the information obtained, transmitted and divulged was “extremely sensitive material”, while his co-prosecutor Per Lindqvist said the sharing of it could be “detrimental to Sweden’s national security”. The trial is expected to run until at least 12 December and will mostly take place behind closed doors because of national security concerns. The brothers could face life sentences if found guilty. In a separate case, Swedish police this week arrested two people on suspicion of espionage. EU diplomats are meeting this evening to resume talks on whether they can finalise a deal on a price level to cap Russian oil exports, sources have told Bloomberg. European governments have failed so far to reach a deal on the price level for Russian oil. A G7 proposal for a cap of $65-$70 a barrel is seen as far too high by some, and too low by others. Six of the EU’s 27 member countries opposed the price cap level proposed by the G7, Reuters cited diplomats as saying on Thursday. Vladimir Putin has met a handpicked cadre of mothers of soldiers fighting in Ukraine for a carefully staged meeting meant to calm public anger over mobilisation. While dozens of ordinary mothers have gone public saying they were snubbed by the Kremlin, Putin sat down with a former government official, the mother of a senior military and police official from Chechnya, and other women active in pro-war NGOs financed by the state. The Guardian has managed to confirm the identifies of at least three of the women who met with Putin on Friday in a highly publicised meeting at his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo on the outskirts of Moscow. None of the women are critical of the war against Ukraine and several have publicly sought to quell fears about the poor treatment, inadequate training and dangers faced by Russian troops being mustered to be sent to the front. Yet the very fact of the meeting showed that the Kremlin is worried about the perception of its mobilisation at home. “It is clear that life is more complicated and diverse than what is shown on TV screens or even on the internet – you can’t trust anything there at all, there are a lot of all sorts of fakes, deception, lies,” Putin told the women, who were seated around a large, oval table. This is why we have gathered with you, that’s why I proposed this meeting, because I wanted to listen to you first-hand. One of the women sitting next to Putin was Olesya Shigina, an ultra-conservative Russian poet, film-maker and activist who recently travelled to the Donbas region to direct a pro-war film featuring Russian troops.

Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you on the Russia-Ukraine war blog. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said Russian attacks on critical Ukrainian infrastructure are a sign of President Vladimir Putin’s “desperation”. Putin is targeting Ukraine’s power grid and other civilian infrastructure to “mask” his military failures, Wallace told reporters during a visit to a shipyard in Glasgow. He urged Ukrainians to “press the momentum to keep pushing Russia back”, adding: On the civil front, they’ve got to protect that national infrastructure that Putin is deliberately targeting in the hope that he wrecks their economy and it means they struggle very greatly during the winter. Targeting civilian infrastructure is illegal under international law, he said, adding that the UK is “not going to let that type of bullying and brutality be successful”. Despite recent signs of Moscow’s failures, such as the withdrawal from Kherson and the firing of a slew of Russian commanders, Wallace warned against underestimating the Russian leader. He said: Russia is a country that at the moment does not care about its own people and which young men it sends to their deaths, and it will just keep on pushing those people in. Mediazone, an independent Russian website founded by two of the people who started the protest group Pussy Riot, has published an account written by a soldier in the 155th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade in the Russian army. They claim that the brigade has had 900 casualties in fighting near Pavlivka, south-west of Donetsk. An open letter from the brigade has previously accused military leaders of the loss of 300 men. Now the new testimony, which the Guardian has not been able to verify, includes claims by an anonymous member of the brigade that 450-500 men were killed in three months of fighting. “Everyone is demoralised. Nobody is celebrating, because so many of our guys are dead. Personally, I lost four friends in just two days,” it says. The soldier says that despite the losses, generals won’t change tactics and have given medals out in an attempt to appease members of the brigade. The soldier adds: People are thinking of deserting, and I understand it, I am now contemplating the same idea. I have always served the motherland faithfully and used to condemn this kind of thinking, but now it is probably the only way we can stay alive. The US has donated 22,500 blankets for warming centres run by Ukraine’s railway company, Ukrzaliznytsia, as temperatures plummet and millions are still without reliable access to power, the US ambassador to Kyiv, Bridget Brink, said. The thermal blankets will be used at heating points at almost 100 railway stations across Ukraine, as part of a project implemented by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). Armenia has asked the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to chair peace talks with Azerbaijan in a fresh challenge to Vladimir Putin’s increasingly loose grip on Russia’s regional allies in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The snub from a traditional ally to Putin, who had hosted an inconsequential meeting of the warring countries’ leaders last month, comes immediately on the back of his disastrous summit with six former Soviet states. During a “family” photograph of leaders of countries in the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) in Yerevan on Wednesday, Armenia’s prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, stepped away from Putin, who had been standing to his left. Pashinyan then refused to sign a summit declaration, as he railed against the recent failures of the CSTO, which ties Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan into a mutual defence agreement. Read the full story here: As attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure continues, here’s our world affairs editor Julian Borger’s dispatch from Kyiv. Much of Ukraine remained without electricity, heat and water two days after a devastating series of Russian missile attacks against the country’s civilian infrastructure. The Kyiv mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said 60% of households in the city of 3 million had no power, and there were rolling blackouts around the country, as engineers struggled to repair transformers and transmission lines damaged or destroyed by cruise missiles on Wednesday. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said basic utilities were gradually being restored, but there were problems with water supplies in 15 regions. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said Russian strikes on critical infrastructure had killed at least 77 people since October. Read more: More on the shelling in Kherson (see 12:21pm), where the governor of the region said that patients are being evacuated from the city’s hospitals because of bombardment by Russian forces. It comes on the same day that a hospital in Zaporizhzhia was damaged overnight. There were no injuries but dozens of windows have been broken Now Yaroslav Yanushevych has posted on his Telegram site: “Due to constant Russian shelling, we are evacuating hospital patients from Kherson.” Children at the Kherson regional clinical hospital will be transported to Mykoliav, and 100 patients at a Kherson regional psychiatric centre will now be treated in Odesa. The US space agency Nasa has released satellite images showing the extent of the energy crisis facing Ukraine following a barrage of Russian strikes on the country’s civilian infrastructure. Night-time satellite images taken from space on Wednesday show the majority of Ukraine in darkness, compared with neighbouring countries in Europe. My colleague Andrew Roth has more on President Vladimir Putin’s meeting with mothers of soldiers fighting in Ukraine earlier today. He notes that one of the mothers in the behind-closed-doors meeting has two sons in active service, including a local police chief who threatened men who were dodging mobilisation that they wouldn’t be allowed to walk the streets if he returned. Germany’s Bundestag is planning to pass a resolution declaring the starvation of millions of Ukrainians under Joseph Stalin a genocide, a move that parliamentarians hope will serve as a “warning” to Moscow as Ukraine faces a potential hunger crisis this winter. The resolution, which will be jointly brought to the vote next week by the three governing parties and the conservative opposition leaders, will describe the 1932-1933 Holodomor as part of “a list of inhuman crimes by totalitarian systems that extinguished millions of human lives in Europe in the first half of the 20th century”. “People across Ukraine, not just in grain-producing regions, were affected by hunger and repression”, the resolution will say. “This meets the historical-political definition from today’s perspective for genocide.” The victims of the Holodomor – Ukrainian for “death by starvation” – are traditionally commemorated in Ukraine on the last Saturday of November. Kyiv regards the historical event as part of a deliberate campaign by Stalin’s regime to collectivise agriculture and root out Ukraine’s fledging nationalist movement. Historians estimate between 4 and 7.5 million people were killed in the human-made disaster. Moscow has rejected Kyiv’s version of history, placing the deaths in the broader context of famines that devastated regions of Central Asia and Russia. Read the full story here: Ukraine’s national energy grid operator, Ukrenergo, has said the battle to restore power to homes is being slowed by “strong winds, rain and sub-zero temperatures at night”. In a statement on Facebook, the company said “more than 70% of the country’s consumption needs” were covered with priority given to critical infrastructure facilities. The statement continued: Reconnection of household consumers is ongoing. Difficult weather conditions are slowing the pace of reconnection: due to strong wind, rain and sub-zero temperatures at night, icing and broken wires in distribution (oblenergo) networks are added to the damage caused by russian missiles. Repair crews are working “around the clock to eliminate damage” following Russian targeting of Ukrainian energy infrastructure, it added. Vladimir Putin has met with mothers of Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, telling them that he had no regrets about launching his “special military operation” and said he shared in their suffering. In a pre-recorded meeting broadcast on state media, the president told the soldiers’ mothers not to believe everything they see on television or read on the internet, claiming there were many “fakes” circulating about the conflict. Sitting with the group of mothers around a table with tea, cakes and bowls of fresh berries, Putin said he and the entire Russian leadership understood and shared the pain of those who had lost their sons fighting in Ukraine. Putin said: I would like you to know that, that I personally, and the whole leadership of the country – we share your pain. He added: We understand that nothing can replace the loss of a son – especially for a mother. We share this pain. He said he had no regrets about launching what he calls Russia’s “special military operation” against Ukraine, casting the war as a watershed moment when Moscow finally stood up to western hegemony. The mothers’ comments to the president were not immediately shown in the recorded television clip. German MPs are set to approve a motion to recognise the Holodomor, the death by starvation of millions of Ukrainians in 1932-33, as a genocide, German media is reporting. Lawmakers are expected to vote on the resolution on Wednesday as Ukraine faces a potential hunger crisis this winter due to Moscow’s invasion. The Holodomor should “join the list of inhumane crimes committed by totalitarian systems, in the course of which millions of human lives were wiped out in Europe, especially in the first half of the 20th century”, reads the draft text of the motion, seen by the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. The draft text continues: People across Ukraine, not just in grain-producing regions, were impacted by hunger and repression. This meets the historical-political definition from today’s perspective for genocide. Ukraine has labelled the Stalin-era famine as a genocide, an assertion rejected by the Kremlin, and interpretations of the famine’s causes have caused friction between the two countries. Robin Wagener, of Germany’s Green party, one of the resolution’s initiators, said Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, operated in the cruel and criminal tradition of Stalin”. He told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: Once more, the basis for life in Ukraine is meant to be taken away through violence and terror, and the entire country brought to heel. Calling the Holodomor a genocide was intended as a “message of warning” to Moscow, he added. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, welcomed “very much that there is a lot of support in the German parliament” for the motion, a spokesperson told reporters. Just days after families reunited in liberated Kherson, residents of the southern Ukrainian city are being forced to flee due to Russian shelling from across the river. Kristina Berdynskykh, a Ukrainian journalist, says her relatives in Kherson urgently left following “heavy shelling” last night and this morning. Moscow has begun to “take revenge” on Kherson and its people “for not accepting the occupation”, she writes. Here’s more from the UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, who spoke about the videos circulating on social media appearing to show Ukrainian soldiers executing Russian prisoners of war. Preliminary analysis of the videos indicate they were “highly likely to be authentic”, Türk said in a statement. He called on both Russia and Ukraine to issue clear instructions to their forces about the treatment of prisoners of war, adding that all allegations of summary executions should be investigated fully. Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has travelled to Kyiv to meet the Ukrainian leadership and promise the UK’s support for as long as it takes to defeat Russia’s brutal efforts to break the country’s resolve. In his first visit to Ukraine since his appointment as foreign secretary, Cleverly met President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. He presented a package of support including money for the reconstruction of schools, ambulances, the victims of sexual violence, and grain sales to the world’s poorest markets, such as Sudan and Yemen. Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine have killed at least 77 civilians since October and have plunged millions of people into extreme hardship, the UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, has said. Since early October, Russian forces have launched missiles roughly once a week with the aim of destroying the Ukrainian energy grid, crippling the country’s power and heat supply. In a statement, Türk said: Millions are being plunged into extreme hardship and appalling conditions of life by these strikes. Taken as a whole, this raises serious problems under international humanitarian law, which requires a concrete and direct military advantage for each object attacked. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Harry Taylor. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Germany said on Friday it was discussing with its allies Poland’s demand to send German Patriot air defence units to Ukraine, Reuters reports. “We are talking with our allies about how to handle Poland’s … suggestion,” a German government spokesperson told reporters in Berlin. Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg told journalists on Friday that it was up to individual governments as to whether they supplied Ukraine with the Patriot systems (see 9.53am). As the time approaches 1pm in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, here is a roundup of today’s updates so far. Russian strikes have damaged a hospital in Zaporizhzhia overnight. The region’s governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said there has been no injuries, but dozens of windows have been broken. The attacks come as Russia’s latest barrage shut down all of Ukraine’s nuclear plants – one of which is located in Zaporizhzhia – for the first time in 40 years. Russia risked causing a “nuclear and radioactive catastrophe” by launching attacks in which all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraine’s nuclear energy chief said. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. All nuclear power stations in the government controlled part of Ukraine are up and running again and connected to the main electricity grid, the country’s energy provider Ukrenergo has said. Its chief executive Volodymyr Kudrytskyi said that if things continue, power cuts will be pre-announced rather than in an emergency. Forbes Ukraine estimates that Russia has spent $82bn – or a quarter of its annual budget – on its war in Ukraine. Forbes reports: “This estimate includes the direct costs that are necessary to support military operations. But it does not include stable defence spending, or losses related to the economy.” The Russian war effort in Ukraine is characterised by confusion among reservists over eligibility for service and inadequate training and equipment, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence. In its daily update, the MoD said some reservists were having to serve with “serious chronic health conditions” since they were called up during Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilisation”. The MoD said Russian soldiers are likely to have suffered heavy casualties while digging “ambitious” trench systems near the town of Svatove in the Luhansk oblast while under heavy artillery fire. It added that Russian reservists have been killed in large numbers in frontal assaults into well-defended Ukrainian areas near Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Both areas are in eastern Ukraine, towards the border with Russia. The UK believes that the Kremlin is likely to be worried about reservists’ families who will risk arrest by protesting about the conditions their relatives face. Half of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is still without power. Energy companies are working to get electricity restored, which will give people power for three hours on an alternating basis. On Wednesday night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke out against “energy terror” by Russia, as it repeatedly seeks to destroy the country’s power infrastructure. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has said there will be “no lasting peace” if Russia wins in Ukraine. He said Nato will continue its support for Ukraine and increase “non-lethal” aid, Reuters reports. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official in the Kyiv office of The Hague-based International Commission on Missing Persons said. The ICMP’s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from family members, or had died and been buried in makeshift graves. European Union governments remained split over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with further talks expected on Friday. Six of the EU’s 27 countries are said to be opposed to the price cap level proposed by the G7, which will come into force on 5 December. Zelenskiy, has called on Europeans to remain united against Russia’s war and to severely limit the price for Russian oil, amid discussions about the pricing EU countries will pay per barrel. Foreign ministers from the G7 will discuss how to further support Ukraine in ensuring its energy supply during a meeting in Bucharest next week, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. The European Union is pressing ahead with a ninth sanctions package on Russia in response to Moscow’s attack on Ukraine, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a visit to Finland. She said the EU would “hit Russia where it hurts to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraine”. Zelenskiy, said Russia’s new strategy to destroy Ukraine’s infrastructure would not weaken the country’s resolve to liberate all occupied land, describing the conflict, in an interview with the Financial Times, as a “war of strength and resilience” and pushing back against western fears of escalation. In his address late on Thursday, Zelenskiy said: “Together we endured nine months of full-scale war and Russia has not found a way to break us, and will not find one.” Zelenskiy also accused Russia of incessantly shelling Kherson, the southern Ukrainian city that it abandoned earlier this month. Ten people were killed and 54 wounded in a Russian attack on Thursday, local authorities said. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said that his country’s parliament would ratify Nato membership for Finland and Sweden early next year. Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared the accession. Stoltenberg backed their membership in a press conference on Friday. Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. British foreign minister James Cleverly said the UK would pledge millions of pounds in further support for Kyiv to ensure the country has the practical help it needed through the winter. Cleverly is visiting Ukraine and is set to meet Zelenskiy and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba on the trip. Russia and Ukraine have carried out the latest in a series of prisoner of war exchanges, with both sides handing over 50 people, officials in Kyiv and Moscow confirmed. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraine’s responsibility, and that if it does not “stop”, it will end in the “complete destruction” of the country. He said that similar to relations with Germany after the second world war, once the Ukraine war has concluded “we will make it all up”. All nuclear power stations in the government-controlled part of Ukraine are up and running again and connected to the main electricity grid, the country’s energy provider, Ukrenergo, has said. Its chief executive, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, said that if the situation continues, power cuts will be pre-announced rather than in an emergency. “Now the energy system is fully integrated, all regions are connected. It is again connected to the energy system of the European Union … All three nuclear power plants located in the unoccupied territory are working … In one to two days, they will reach their normal planned capacity, and we expect that it will be possible to return to scheduled power outages instead of emergency ones,” Kudrytskyi said during a nationwide telethon on Thursday evening, Ukrinform reports. A missile attack on 23 November meant that Ukraine lost power from nuclear, thermal, and hydroelectric generators. Kudrytskyi encouraged Ukrainians to save energy where possible. Further to our updates from Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg’s press conference earlier (see 9.17am), he also told reporters that the decision over whether to send more air defence units to Ukraine was up to member states. Poland has asked Germany to send the US Patriot systems to Ukraine. He said they were “national decisions”, Reuters reports, adding that some agreements meant that consultation with allies was needed. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on Europeans to remain united against Russia’s war and to severely limit the price for Russian oil, amid discussions about the pricing EU countries will pay per barrel. “There is no split, there is no schism among Europeans and we have to preserve this. This is our mission number one this year,” Zelenskiy said in an address via a live video link to a conference in Lithuania. “Europe is helping itself. It’s not helping Ukraine to stand against Russia, this is helping Europe to stand against Russian aggression”, he added, according to Reuters. European Union governments remained split on Thursday over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for the war, and Zelenskiy called on the EU leaders to settle on the lowest proposal of $30. “The price cuts are very important. We hear about (proposals to set the cap per barrel at) $60 or $70. Such words sound more like a concession (to Russia)“, Zelenskiy said. “But I’m very grateful to our Baltic and Polish colleagues for their proposals, quite reasonable ones, to set this camp at $30 a barrel. It’s a much better idea”, he added. Our correspondent in Ukraine, Isobel Koshiw has visited Kherson, the recently recaptured city in the south of the country, which faced heavy shelling last night. She has tweeted: “Kherson was shelled very heavily last night by Russian troops stationed on the eastern bank. According to Kherson’s head, Yanushevych, 10 people died and 54 were badly injured as a result. “The initial euphoria was (inevitably) going to fade. But the amount of incoming increased every day and there were more people leaving the city. There was a sharp drop in atmosphere. “The city is/was relatively intact. But if Russia wants to turn it into Kharkiv 2, where every 3rd-4th building is damaged, they could. Their frontline is just across the river. “Though in the case of Kherson, there are even lower prospects that shelling the city will result in any kind of victory or advance for Russia.” Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has been speaking at a press conference this morning, ahead of a foreign ministers’ meeting in Romania next week. Stoltenberg said it would continue its support for Ukraine and increase “non-lethal” aid, Reuters reports. “Nato will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. We will not back down,” he told reporters in Brussels. “Many wars end in negotiations, but what happens at the negotiating table depends on what happens on the battlefield.” He added that there was “no lasting peace” if Russia won, and also said Finland and Sweden should be welcomed as “fully fledged” members of the alliance. The UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has tweeted this photograph of him meeting Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday morning. The BBC has interviewed Ukrainian president Voldymyr Zelenskiy’s wife, Olena Zelenska, where she refers to the long road ahead for Ukrainians amid the Russian invasion. She compared the situation to a foot race, saying: “You know, it is easy to run a marathon when you know how many kilometres there are,” but adding that unlike a marathon, the Ukrainian war effort is indeterminable. “Sometimes it can be very difficult. But there are some new emotions that help us to hold on.” Zelenska also talked of the difficulty she faced because of the separation from her husband. The Russian forces had designated Zelenskiy and his family as targets. “I live separately with my children and my husband lives at work,” she said. “Most of all, we miss simple things – to sit, not looking at the time, as long as we want.” Speaking to the BBC’s chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, for the broadcaster’s 100 Women season, Zelenska said the Ukrainians are determined to fight on. “We all understand that without victory, there will be no peace. It would be a false peace and wouldn’t last long.” The UK’s foreign secretary is visiting Ukraine today. Our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour has this. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, travelled to Kyiv on Thursday to meet the Ukrainian leadership and promise support for as long as it takes to defeat Russia’s brutal efforts to break the country’s resolve. In his first visit to Ukraine since his appointment as foreign secretary, Cleverly presented a package of support including money for the reconstruction of schools, ambulances, the victims of sexual violence, and grain sales to the world’s poorest markets, such as Sudan and Yemen. With Kyiv under regular bombardment, his visit, which follows a trip to the Ukrainian capital by Rishi Sunak on Saturday, was conducted with a high level of security. The new Conservative leadership is eager to reassure the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Boris Johnson’s departure from No 10 will not lead to waning levels of British moral, military and financial support. Cleverly said: “As winter sets in, Russia is continuing to try and break Ukrainian resolve through its brutal attacks on civilians, hospitals and energy infrastructure. Russia will fail.” It’s just gone 9.30am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where some of its residents have woken up without electricity. Last night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke out against “energy terror” by Russia, as it repeatedly seeks to take out the country’s power infrastructure. Kyiv’s major, Vitali Klitschko, told citizens that energy companies would try to get electricity back on for customers on a three-hour rotating basis. He said that half of the city is still without power. The Russian war effort in Ukraine is characterised by confusion among reservists over eligibility for service and inadequate training and equipment, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence. In its daily update, the MoD said some reservists were having to serve with “serious chronic health conditions” since they were called up during Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilisation”. The soldiers are likely to have had heavy casualties while digging “ambitious” trench systems near the town of Svatove in the Luhansk oblast while they were under heavy artillery fire. It added that Russian reservists have been killed in large numbers in frontal assaults into well-defended Ukrainian areas near Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Both areas are in eastern Ukraine, towards the border with Russia. The UK believes that the Kremlin is likely to be worried about reservists’ families who will risk arrest by protesting about the conditions their relatives face. Forbes Ukraine estimates that Russia has spent $82bn – or a quarter of its annual budget – on its war in Ukraine, which has lasted nine months so far. Forbes reports: This estimate includes the direct costs that are necessary to support military operations. But it does not include stable defence spending, or losses related to the economy. In 2021, all budget revenues of Russia amounted to $340bn. That is, the Russian Federation has already spent a quarter of last year’s revenues on military operations. If in the spring such costs could look quite acceptable, considering that the Russian Federation received about $1bn a day for oil and gas. Now the situation is different. The revenues of the federal budget of the Russian Federation from the export of oil and gas are decreasing – Russia has already lost most of the European gas market after the Nord Stream supply was cut off. Sanctions on Russian oil will begin in December. Oil prices rose in Asia on Friday after a week marked by worries about Chinese demand and haggling over a western price cap on Russian oil, Reuters reports. Brent crude futures rose by 28 cents, or 0.33%, to trade at $85.62 a barrel at 0410 GMT. G7 and European Union diplomats have been discussing levels for a Russian price cap of between $65 and $70 a barrel, with the aim of limiting revenue to fund Moscow’s military offensive in Ukraine without disrupting global oil markets. “The market considers (the price caps) too high which reduces the risk of Moscow retaliating,” ANZ Research analysts said in a note to clients. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said Moscow will not supply oil and gas to any countries that join in imposing the price cap, which the Kremlin reiterated on Thursday. Trading is expected to remain cautious ahead of an agreement on the price cap, due to come into effect on 5 December when an EU ban on Russian crude kicks off, and ahead of the next meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, on 4 December. Russian strikes have damaged a hospital in Zaporizhzhia overnight, the region’s governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said on Telegram. He wrote: The enemy again attacked the suburbs of Zaporizhzhia. This time the rockets hit near the hospital. Fortunately, people were not injured, the same cannot be said about the building. Dozens of broken windows. The attacks come as Russia’s latest barrage shut down all of Ukraine’s nuclear plants – one of which is located in Zaporizhzhia – for the first time in 40 years. Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the Financial Times that this week’s strikes had created a situation not seen for 80 or 90 years: “A country on the European continent where there was totally no light.” By early Thursday evening, officials said a reactor at one nuclear plant, Khmelnytskyi, had been reconnected to the grid. The vast Zaporizhzhia plant in Russian-held territory was reconnected on Thursday, Ukrainian nuclear power company Energoatom said. This is the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest as it happens for the next while. Russian strikes have damaged a hospital in Zaporizhzhia overnight, the region’s governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said on Telegram. On Thursday night, more than 24 hours after Russian strikes had devastated Kyiv’s infrastructure, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said 60% of homes were still suffering emergency outages. Water services had been fully restored however, said city officials. Here are the other key recent developments: Russia risked causing a “nuclear and radioactive catastrophe” by launching attacks in which all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraine’s nuclear energy chief said. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. Ukraine expected the three nuclear power plants would be operating again by Thursday evening, energy minister German Galushchenko said. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official in the Kyiv office of The Hague-based International Commission on Missing Persons said. The ICMP’s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from family members, or had died and been buried in makeshift graves.

Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/27/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-185-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-27T00:16:54Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 185 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/27/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-185-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/27/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-185-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 185 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains “very risky” after two of its six reactors were reconnected to the grid following shelling that caused Europe’s largest nuclear power plant to be disconnected for the first time in its history. “Let me stress that the situation remains very risky and dangerous,” he said in his regular evening address on Friday, praising Ukrainian experts working to “avert the worst-case scenario.” Residents near the Zaporizhzhia plant have reportedly been given iodine tablets, amid mounting fears that the fighting around the complex could trigger a catastrophe. Zelenskiy said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” on Thursday when electricity to the Zaporizhzhia plant was cut for hours after fires broke out around the Russian-occupied complex in south-eastern Ukraine. A team of inspectors from the United Nations nuclear watchdog are poised to make an emergency visit to the Zaporizhzhia plant, according to reports. Sources have told the Wall Street Journal it is “almost certain” that a mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency will visit the plant early next week, although details are still being completed. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has announced plans to expand mandatory evacuations for civilians living on the war’s frontlines. Speaking on national television, she said evacuating women with children and elderly people would be a priority from some districts of the eastern Kharkiv region, and the southern Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv regions. Ukrainian forces have struck an important bridge used by Russian occupying forces in the southern Kherson region, according to Ukraine’s southern military command. The Daryivskiy Bridge is the only Russian-controlled crossing across the Inhulets river, which splits the Russian-occupied land west of the Dnipro into two parts. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, an ally of president Vladimir Putin, said in a French television interview on Friday that Russia was prepared to hold talks with Zelenskiy subject to certain conditions, but warned Moscow would not stop its assault until its goals had been achieved. “Renouncing (Ukraine’s) participation in the North Atlantic alliance is now vital, but it is already insufficient in order to establish peace,” Medvedev told LCI television in quotes reported by Russian news agencies. EU energy ministers will gather for an urgent meeting as soon as possible to discuss the energy crisis following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Czech prime minister said. The Czech Republic currently holds the presidency of the European Council. Russia’s claim that it is deliberately slowing the pace of its military campaign in Ukraine is “almost certainly deliberate misinformation”, according to British intelligence. The latest UK Ministry of Defence report said Russia’s offensive had stalled “because of poor Russian military performance and fierce Ukrainian resistance”. The Belarusian president has said his country’s SU-24 warplanes have been re-fitted to carry nuclear armaments. Alexander Lukashenko said he had previously agreed to the move with his Russian counterpart, Putin, and warned that his country was ready to respond to “serious provocation” from the west instantly. Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas that it would previously have exported to Germany while energy costs soar in Europe, the BBC has reported. According to the broadcaster, which cites an analysis by Rystad Energy, a plant near Russia’s border with Finland is burning an estimated £8.4m worth of gas every day. The head of the UK’s energy regulator, Ofgem, has blamed Russia for driving up energy prices, resulting in the UK price cap rising by 80%. Ofgem on Friday approved a £1,578 increase on the current price cap of £1,971 for the average dual-fuel tariff. The German ambassador to the UK has acknowledged there is a risk public support for Ukraine could wane this winter as the energy crisis intensifies. Putin was “using gas as a weapon” in the UK and all of Europe, Miguel Berger said. “He wants to test our resolve.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/feb/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-pushes-for-10th-sanctions-package-from-eu-leaders-meeting-in-kyiv","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-03T19:02:20Z","webTitle":"New US military package includes rocket-powered bomb to double Ukraine’s strike range – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/feb/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-pushes-for-10th-sanctions-package-from-eu-leaders-meeting-in-kyiv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/feb/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-pushes-for-10th-sanctions-package-from-eu-leaders-meeting-in-kyiv","fields":{"headline":"New US military package includes rocket-powered bomb to double Ukraine’s strike range – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The US has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $2.175bn (£2.2bn). The package will include precision-guided rockets and HAWK air defence firing units, as well as other munitions and weapons, the US state department said. Significantly, it includes the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) for the first time, which will double Ukraine’s strike range and allow Ukraine’s military to strike deep behind the frontlines of the war. France and Italy have finalised technical talks for the joint delivery of the SAMP/T air defence system to Ukraine in spring 2023, the French defence ministry has announced. It comes after Italy foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said on Thursday that the SAMP/T system would be operational in Ukraine “within seven to eight weeks”. The system can track dozens of targets and intercept 10 at once. It is the only European-made system that can intercept ballistic missiles. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine will continue to fight for Bakhmut as long as it can, vowing that “nobody will give away” the eastern “fortress” city. Speaking at a press conference following a summit in Kyiv with EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the Ukrainian leader said Ukrainians would be able to begin to liberate occupied Donbas if weapons supplies are “quickened, specifically long range weapons”. EU member countries have agreed on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products, the Swedish presidency of the EU said. Ambassadors of the 27 EU states agreed at a meeting on Friday to impose a $100-per-barrel cap on premium products such as diesel and a $45 cap on low-end products, according to diplomats. The price cap comes into effect on Sunday, as does the EU’s ban on Russian oil product imports. The EU has promised a tenth package of sanctions against Russia will be in place by 24 February, the first anniversary of the war. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the package would cover trade worth €10bn and “hit the trade and technology that supports [Russia’s] war against Ukraine”. The next round of EU sanctions, however, is not expected to include nuclear power, which Hungary has already threatened to block. President Zelenskiy appealed to the EU to impose sanctions on Russia’s state-run nuclear monopoly Rosatom and its top managers. Zelenskiy said during talks with EU leaders that they had discussed “the extension of the energy sanctions to cover the nuclear sphere”. He argued sanctions should target Rosatom and its managers, who he accused of the seizure and forced nationality change of staff at Ukrainian nuclear power facilities and their children. Air raid sirens twice sounded across Ukraine on Friday as President Zelenskiy hosted EU leaders in Kyiv. The first air alert in Kyiv was on Friday morning. The second, hours later, followed a joint news conference involving Zelenskiy, von der Leyen and Charles Michel. There were no immediate reports of any Russian airstrikes on Kyiv throughout the day. EU leaders offered strong support for Ukraine but set “no rigid timelines” for its accession to the bloc. President Zelenskiy had hoped the EU would put Ukraine on a rapid track to membership, but western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv’s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. “There are no rigid timelines, but there are goals that you have to reach,” von der Leyen told the news conference. The EU will launch a humanitarian de-mining programme in Ukraine worth €25m, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has confirmed. De-mining is “crucial to save the lives of civilian population”, Borrell said. The EU will also supply Ukraine with 35m LED lightbulbs, 2,400 generators on top of 3,000 already delivered and promised funding for solar panels to power Ukraine’s public buildings. New tanks supplied by Nato allies will serve as an “iron fist” in a counteroffensive by Kyiv to break through Russian defensive lines, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said. Western supplies of 155-mm artillery will be vital for Ukraine to deter Russian attacks in the south and in the east, Reznikov said at a joint news conference with his Polish counterpart, Mariusz Błaszczak. Germany has approved the export of older Leopard 1 battle tanks, which would add to the raft of fighting vehicles Berlin promised last week it would send to Ukraine. A spokesperson said Olaf Scholz’s government had granted an export licence for the German-made tanks first produced in the 1960s and replaced within Germany’s own military by Leopard 2 tanks in 2003. Germany is also understood to be in the process of preparing a joint weapons package with Sweden in which Stockholm would provide air defence missiles and launching platforms for Germany’s Iris-T systems. Robert Habeck, the German deputy chancellor and economic minister, discussed this joint package in a meeting with the Swedish minister for foreign trade, Johan Forssell, during a state visit on Thursday, one government official said. Germany will not play a “key” role in the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv because “it is American technology”, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said. In an interview with BBC News Ukraine, Kuleba said he had “no doubt” that the decision to supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets would be made, adding that Kyiv was “open to communication with all partners” on aircraft such as the Swedish Gripens, French Mirages and Rafales. Ukraine has unveiled a criminal case against Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. Prigozhin has been charged with encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine and of waging a war of aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said Wagner fighters of all ranks would be held responsible, including those who fled abroad. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked Joe Biden for the new US military aid package, which includes a new rocket that will double Ukraine’s strike range for the first time in its war with Russia. The greater Ukraine’s long-range weapons capacity, and the more mobile its troops, the sooner Russia’s brutal aggression will end, Zelenskiy posted to Twitter. France and Italy have finalised technical talks for the joint delivery of the SAMP/T air defence system to Ukraine in spring 2023, the French defence ministry has announced. In a statement after a call between France’s defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, and his Italian counterpart, Guido Crosetto, the ministry said: This will allow Ukraine to defend itself against Russian drones, missiles and plane attacks, through the coverage of a significant part of the Ukrainian territory. It comes after Italy foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said yesterday that the SAMP/T system would be operational in Ukraine “within seven to eight weeks”. France and Italy agreed to supply their SAMP/T air defence system, known as Mamba, to Ukraine on Kyiv’s request, to help protect the country’s critical infrastructure and cities from the regular barrage of Russian missiles hitting Ukraine. The system can track dozens of targets and intercept 10 at once. It is the only European-made system that can intercept ballistic missiles. A new US military aid package for Ukraine worth more than $2.175bn includes a new rocket that would double Ukraine’s strike range, according to a US official. The Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) will be provided to Ukraine as part of Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), Brig Gen Patrick Ryder told a news briefing. The GLSDB’s range is 94 miles (151 km), double that of Ukraine’s current longest-range weapon, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), whose rockets can travel 48 miles (77 km). A greater range would allow Ukraine’s military to strike deep behind the frontlines of the war, attacking Russian forces from a greater distance or potentially penetrating more deeply into Russian-held territory. The GLSDB will put all of Russia’s supply lines in the east of the country within reach, as well as part of Russian-occupied Crimea. It will force Russia to move its supplies farther from the frontlines, which could make its soldiers more vulnerable and complicate plans for any new offensive. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said new tanks supplied by Nato allies will serve as an “iron fist” in a counteroffensive by Kyiv to break through Russian defensive lines. Western supplies of 155-mm artillery will be vital for Ukraine to deter Russian attacks in the south and in the east, Reznikov said at a joint news conference with his Polish counterpart, Mariusz Błaszczak. Reznikov said: The new tank coalition with the main tanks of Nato countries - we need this for the counteroffensive, we will use it like an iron fist to break through their defensive lines. Błaszczak, who is in Kyiv for talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, said Warsaw was helping to train Ukrainian soldiers to use western tanks and that completing the training was a question of “weeks not days or months”. EU member countries have agreed on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products, the Swedish presidency of the EU said. Ambassadors of the 27 EU states agreed at a meeting today to impose a $100-per-barrel cap on premium products such as diesel and a $45 cap on low-end products, according to diplomats. The price cap comes into effect on Sunday, as does the EU’s ban on Russian oil product imports. It follows a $60 per-barrel cap imposed on Russian crude on 5 December. The EU’s 10th package of sanctions against Russia will hit the trade and technology that supports its war against Ukraine, according to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. The US has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $2.175bn (£2.2bn). The package will include precision-guided rockets and HAWK air defence firing units, as well as other munitions and weapons, the US state department said. Foreign Policy’s Jack Detsch has the full list: It’s nearly 7pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine will continue to fight for Bakhmut as long as it can, vowing that “nobody will give away” the eastern “fortress” city. Speaking at a press conference following a summit in Kyiv with EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the Ukrainian leader said Ukrainians would be able to begin to liberate occupied Donbas if weapons supplies are “quickened, specifically long range weapons”.

Speaking alongside Zelenskiy, Ursula von der Leyen said the package would cover trade worth €10bn and focus on technology used by the Russian military, such as drone components, as well as measures to counter circumvention of sanctions. The next round of EU sanctions, however, is not expected to include nuclear power, which Hungary has already threatened to block.

Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said Wagner fighters of all ranks would be held responsible, including those who fled abroad. Russian-installed authorities in Crimea have said they had nationalised about 500 properties in the peninsula, including some belonging to senior Ukrainian politicians and business figures. In a statement on Telegram, Vladimir Konstantinov, speaker of the Crimean parliament, said the nationalised properties included banks and tourist and sport infrastructure. Norwegian police say they intend to continue to interrogate a former commander with the Russian mercenary Wagner group who sought asylum in Norway after fighting in Ukraine. Andrey Medvedev has handed “some digital material” to police, Norway’s national criminal police service, Kripos, said in a statement. He remains a witness and is not under any obligation to talk to investigators, it added. The National Olympic Committee of Ukraine has decided not to immediately boycott the Paris 2024 Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete. Instead, it will consult with and persuade sports officials around the world to take action over the next two months. The head of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, Tony Estanguet, has said it is for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to decide whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete in the Games next year. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest news from Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appealed to the European Union to impose sanctions on Russia’s state-run nuclear monopoly Rosatom and its top managers. Ukraine’s president was speaking at a press conference following a summit in Kyiv with EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, who lead the European Commission and European Council respectively. The EU has promised a tenth package of sanctions against Russia will be in place by 24 February, the first anniversary of the war. Zelenskiy said during talks with EU leaders they had discussed “the extension of the energy sanctions to cover the nuclear sphere”. He argued sanctions should target Rosatom and its managers, who he accused of the seizure and forced nationality change of staff at Ukrainian nuclear power facilities and their children. We would like some of the states, European states who still don’t want to impose sanctions against Rosatom, the top managers of Rosatom… the nuclear power for them to understand what if their children were just taken, put into buses and forcefully taken to the Russian Federation. For this forced deportation you need to enforce sanctions. The next round of EU sanctions, however, is not expected to include nuclear power, which Hungary has already threatened to block. Russia has provided Hungary with a €10bn loan to expand a nuclear power plant with Russian nuclear reactors. Last week the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán said extending sanctions to nuclear power “obviously needs to be vetoed”. All EU sanctions must be passed unanimously by the bloc’s 27 member states. Speaking alongside Zelenskiy, von der Leyen said the EU’s 10th package of sanctions would cover trade worth €10bn and focus on technology used by the Russian military, such as drone components. The package will also include measures to counter circumvention of sanctions, she said. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, has tweeted a clip of his recent joint press conference with Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. The Ukrainian people have made “a clear choice for freedom, democracy, and rule of law”, Michel said. He continues: We in the EU have also made a clear decision. Your future is with us in our common European Union. Your destiny is our destiny. At the joint press conference in Kyiv, von der Leyen said there were goals for Ukraine to meet as part of its EU membership push. Asked about Ukraine’s accession drive, she said: There are no rigid timelines, but there are goals that you have to reach. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine will continue to fight for Bakhmut as long as it can, vowing that “nobody will give away” the eastern “fortress” city. Speaking at a news conference with top European Union officials, Zelenskiy said: Nobody will give away Bakhmut. We will fight for as long as we can. We consider Bakhmut our fortress. Ukraine would be able to hold Bakhmut and liberate occupied Donbas “if it received long-range weapons”, Zelenskiy added. He said: If weapons (supplies) are quickened, specifically long range weapons, we not only will not leave Bakhmut, but we will also begin to deoccupy Donbas, which has been occupied since 2014. The city of Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region has become the focal point of Ukrainian resistance and of intense efforts by Moscow to regain battlefield momentum. Russian officials have said its forces are encircling Bakhmut from several directions and battling to take control of a road which is also an important supply route for Ukrainian forces. Zelenskiy said Russia would continue to push in the east, but that Ukrainian forces would be able to hold out until more western weapons arrived. Air raid sirens have sounded in Kyiv, my colleague Dan Sabbagh reports. Here are some of the most recent images sent over the news wires from Kherson in Ukraine. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne reports that at least one person has been killed by shelling in Donetsk. It posted to its official Telegram channel: Russian troops shelled the centre of Toretsk in Donetsk region: one person was killed, six were injured. Kurakhivka was also shelled from artillery, three people were injured, the Donetsk regional prosecutor’s office reported. The claims have not been independently verified. Traders are using Turkey, Kazakhstan and Armenia to evade EU sanctions on Russia, a tactic that breaches these countries’ compliance with the bloc’s embargo, Latvia’s prime minister said on Friday. Krisjanis Karins made the assertion after talks with counterparts from the EU member states Estonia and Lithuania, which along with Latvia have been among the most vocal supporters of sanctions on Russia after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. “It seems quite clear that traders are finding ways to legally trade goods, say with Turkey, Kazakhstan or Armenia, which are then re-sent to Russia, because these countries are not adhering to the sanctions regime,” Reuters says Karins told reporters in Talinn, the Estonian capital. Back with the Olympics for a moment, the Associated Press is reporting that the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine has decided not to immediately boycott the Paris 2024 Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete, but instead at its extraordinary general assembly held today, it approved plans to consult with and persuade sports officials around the world to take action over the next two months. The committee members voted for “consultations on preventing the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in all international competitions and a possible boycott”. Ukraine boycotted some sporting events last year rather than compete against Russians. The last multinational boycott of an Olympics was in 1998, when North Korea were joined by Cuba, Ethiopia and Nicaragua in boycotting the Seoul Olympics in South Korea. The first task is to wipe off or cover up the Z, says Anatoly, 44, of the call sign infamously daubed on Russian hardware involved in the war in Ukraine. “We don’t want friendly fire later on.” Then the mechanics get to work. In a secret location in Ukraine, within a vast warehouse that could be mistaken for a tank graveyard, what was once Russian – Soviet, in many cases – is being turned Ukrainian. All the headlines have recently been made by the decision of Germany and a host of others to supply Ukraine with western heavy armour: Leopard 2s, Challengers and Abrams. The names have become familiar and they may have the technical cutting-edge and firepower to turn the course of the Ukraine war, when they arrive and if in sufficient numbers. But for all the efforts of the Nato allies, it is Russia that is unwittingly, and yet by some margin, Ukraine’s biggest donor of tanks today. Oryx, the open-source Dutch intelligence defence analysis website, has collected photographs of 546 captured Russian tanks. It will be just a fraction of the total haul of tanks that were either abandoned by the fleeing Russian forces or seized in bloody battle. Read the full story here: The head of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games has said it is for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to decide whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete in the Games next year. Tony Estanguet told Reuters he was “in favour of maintaining this symbol of universality for the Games” when asked about Russian and Belarusian participation. The decision rested with the Games’ governing body, he added. Estanguet said: It’s not in the charge of Paris 2024 to decide who is allowed to participate, it’s about the IOC, it’s about the IPC, it’s about the international federations who will decide which delegations will be allowed to participate. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on the IOC to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing at the 2024 Paris Games. Allowing them to take part would be tantamount to showing that “terror is somehow acceptable”, Zelenskiy has said. On Thursday, sports ministers from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland called on international sports bodies to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in the Olympics and other events while the war in Ukraine continues. Poland’s sport and tourism minister, Kamil Bortniczuk, told Reuters he believed it would be possible to build a coalition of about 40 countries, including the US, Britain and Canada, supporting the call to block Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympics. Here’s some more detail on the news that Ukraine has unveiled a criminal case against Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said in a statement that his office has served “a notice of suspicion to the head of the private military company ‘Wagner’”, without identifying Prigozhin by name. He added: The head of this group is directly responsible for thousands of war crimes. He openly admits his role in the war against Ukraine and, with the Kremlin’s permission, resolves staff issues by recruiting tens of thousands of prisoners. Under Ukraine’s criminal code, suspects in criminal cases must be informed in a “notice of suspicion”. Kostin listed accusations against Wagner, including encroachment on Ukraine’s territorial integrity and waging an aggressive war. He added that Wagner fighters of all ranks would be held responsible, including those who fled abroad. He added: I am certain together with international partners we will ensure comprehensive responsibility both for every criminal who came to our land with weapons in his hands and also for their patrons who do business in blood. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said Germany will not play a “key” role in the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv because “it is American technology”. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, ruled out sending fighter jets to Ukraine earlier this week, saying his focus was on the delivery of German-made Leopard 2 tanks. In an interview with BBC News Ukraine, Kuleba said his country “really needs” planes and long-range missiles “to destroy the military infrastructure of the Russian occupying forces” in occupied territories of Ukraine. He said he had “no doubt” that the decision to supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets would be made, adding that Kyiv was “open to communication with all partners” on aircraft such as the Swedish Gripens, French Mirages and Rafales. Asked about Scholz’s role, Kuleba said the issue of jets “is far from Germany”. He said: Why was the position of Germany and Chancellor Scholz important regarding Leopard tanks? It is a [mass-produced] tank, but it is German technology, so Germany’s word was key. In the issue of aircraft, Germany’s word is not key, because it is American technology. Among the blizzard of announcements aimed at showing the EU’s support for Kyiv, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said Europe is “bringing light to Ukraine”. Von der Leyen has confirmed the EU will supply Ukraine with 35m LED lightbulbs, 2,400 generators on top of 3,000 already delivered and promised funding for solar panels to power Ukraine’s public buildings. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said he was “grateful” to Von der Leyen. The EU will launch a humanitarian de-mining programme in Ukraine worth €25m, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has confirmed. De-mining is “crucial to save the lives of civilian population”, Borrell wrote on social media. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, announced the programme after meeting with Borrell in Kyiv yesterday, posting to Telegram that it was an “important component of our recovery, which will allow us to return normal life”. Norway has confirmed it will order 54 new German-made Leopard 2 tanks for its army from the Krauss-Maffei Wegmann Group, with an option to buy a further 18 tanks at a later time. Speaking at a news conference, the Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre said: We ensure that we have the same tanks as our Nordic neighbours and many key Nato allies. This “further strengthens our relationship with Germany”, he added. Norway, which shares a 196km (122-mile) Arctic border with Russia, had planned to either order German-made Leopard 2 A7 tanks or the Korean-produced K2 Black Panther. Norwegian police say they intend to continue to interrogate a former commander with the Russian mercenary Wagner group who sought asylum in Norway after fighting in Ukraine. Andrey Medvedev, who had previously told the Guardian he feared for his life and that he had witnessed the summary killing of Wagner fighters, has handed “some digital material” to police, Norway’s national criminal police service, Kripos, said in a statement. The material was being examined, it added. Medvedev remains a witness and is not under any obligation to talk to investigators, Kripos said, adding that he “gives the impression that he wants to continue to say more” about his time with Wagner. Medvedev is the first known soldier from the Wagner group who fought in Ukraine to flee abroad. Security arrangements have also been made for Medvedev’s safety, “both visible and non-visible” measures, Kripos added. European Council president Charles Michel is in Kyiv, along with the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and 15 European commissioners to meet President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for what they describe as a summit meeting. The highly symbolic visit is the first EU political mission of its kind to a country at war, and comes as the bloc prepares to adopt a 10th package of sanctions against Russia. “There will be no let-up in our resolve,” Michel tweeted as he arrived in the Ukrainian capital. He added: We will also support you every step of the way on your journey to the EU. Germany has approved a delivery of Leopard 1 main battle tanks to Ukraine from industrial stocks, government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit has said. Hebestreit confirmed “an export licence has been issued” for the delivery by a private arms-marker of its older Leopard 1 tanks, but did not provide further details. Süddeutsche Zeitung had reported that the German government approved German arms maker Rheinmetall’s plans to sell 88 of the older Leopards to Ukraine for a total cost of more than €100m. Deliveries of the older Leopard 1 tanks from the industrial stocks could be made as soon as the tanks are repaired, the paper writes. However, there are still problems in obtaining the required 105-millimetre ammunition, it writes. It comes after the German government announced it would send 14 Leopard 2 main battle tanks from Bundeswehr stocks to Ukraine. Berlin is also considering buying back 15 Gepard tanks it had sold to Qatar, the German newspaper reported. It said several German officials had discussed with Qatar’s foreign ministry the possible purchase of Gepard tanks that Doha had bought to secure the World Cup stadiums. The paper quoted Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, as saying: The Gepards have proven themselves very well in the war in Ukraine. If we could get more from partners here, that would definitely help the Ukrainians. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Martin Belam. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Top EU officials are due to meet on Friday in Kyiv with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the European Council president, Charles Michel, as well as 15 European commissioners, traveled to the Ukrainian capital for ‘a summit meeting’. Von der Leyen is on her fourth visit to Kyiv since Russia’s invasion. EU leaders will seek to cool Ukraine’s expectations of a fast track to membership, while avoiding negative public statements that could weaken morale and damage Zelenskiy’s efforts to project a European future for Ukrainians. Western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv’s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. Zelenskiy called on Thursday for more punitive measures against Russia by the EU, but sanctions being prepared by the bloc for the anniversary will fall short of his government’s demands. “We see today that the pace of sanctions in Europe has slowed down a little,” Zelenskiy told a joint news conference. “The terrorist state increases the pace of adaptation to sanctions instead. It should be resolved. We believe that we can do it together.” Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, responded to the Ukrainian president’s comments on Friday, saying: “Western Europe, falling into recession, having long lost the habit of survival, is sinking, with Ukraine tied to its feet.” The EU has pledged to double a military aid programme for Ukraine by training an extra 15,000 soldiers as part of a blizzard of announcements aimed at showing it will “stand by Ukraine for the long haul”. Von der Leyen also reiterated that the EU would cap the price of Russian petroleum products, as part of a broader G7 plan to restrict oil revenues available to the Kremlin’s war machine. The prosecutor general’s office of Ukraine has pressed criminal charges against Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. Prigozhin has been charged with encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine and of waging a war of aggression against Ukraine. There are reports that one person has been killed in a car bomb explosion in occupied Enerhodar in Zaporizhzhia region. Dmitri Orlov, Ukraine’s mayor of the city, claimed the victim was a former Ukrainian policeman who had defected to help the authorities in the area of Ukraine which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has this morning said the war will continue in Ukraine as Donbas is not “fully protected yet”. Russian-installed authorities in Crimea said on Friday they had nationalised about 500 properties in the peninsula, including some belonging to senior Ukrainian politicians and business figures. Nato called on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the Start nuclear reductions treaty, it said in a statement on Friday. Norway will order 54 new German-made Leopard tanks for its army from the KraussMaffei group, the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported on Friday. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you for the next few hours. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has this morning said the war will continue in Ukraine as Donbas is not ‘fully protected yet’. The Russian state-owned news agency Tass quotes him as saying: Donbas is not fully protected yet, so a special military operation continues. Actually, we must protect the people who live there until this goal is fully achieved. This remains to be done. Peskov went on to say that “the security of Crimea is ensured reliably”. Russia claimed to annex the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014 in a move not widely recognised by the international community. The air alert that has been in force across Ukraine for nearly the last two hours has ended, the state broadcaster Suspilne reports. Nato called on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the Start nuclear reductions treaty, it said in a statement on Friday. “We note with concern that Russia has failed to comply with legally binding obligations, including on inspection, and call on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty,” Reuters reports Nato’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in a tweet. The main event in Kyiv today is that top European Union officials are due to meet Friday in Kyiv with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel, as well as 15 European commissioners, traveled to the Ukrainian capital for what they described as a summit meeting. Von der Leyen is on her fourth visit to Kyiv since Russia’s invasion. Susie Blann at Associated Press writes that the last such summit was held in Kyiv in October 2021 — a few months before Russia’s latest incursion into Ukraine. Since then, assistance for Ukraine from the EU has reached almost €50bn (£44.6bn / $55bn) since the fighting started. The EU is providing Ukraine with financial and humanitarian aid and plans to adopt a 10th package of sanctions again Russia in the coming weeks – the pace of which has been criticised by Zelenskiy. Ukraine wants to join the 27-nation bloc on an accelarated timescale, though it could take years. In the meantime, von der Leyen said Thursday that the European Commission is willing to let Kyiv join what she called some “key European programs” that will bring benefits similar to membership. Those programs were due to be discussed in Friday’s meeting, which will also address one of the main obstacles to Ukraine’s EU membership: accusations of endemic corruption. Norway will order 54 new German-made Leopard tanks for its army from the KraussMaffei Group, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported on Friday, citing anonymous sources. Reuters reports the Nordic Nato member, which shares a 196 km (122 miles) Arctic border with Russia, had planned to choose either German-made Leopard 2 A7 tanks or the rival Korean-produced K2 Black Panther. Russian-installed authorities in Crimea said on Friday that they had nationalised around 500 properties in the peninsula including some belonging to senior Ukrainian politicians and business figures. In a statement on Telegram, Vladimir Konstantinov, speaker of the Crimean parliament, said that the decree targeted “accomplices of the Kyiv regime” and that the nationalised properties included banks and tourist and sport infrastructure. Reuters reports that according to a document published on a Crimean government website, properties belonging to former Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and businessmen Igor Kolomoisky, Rinat Akhmetov and Serhiy Taruta were among those confiscated. Crimea, which is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, has been controlled by Moscow since 2014, when Russia unilaterally annexed the peninsula. The prosecutor general’s office of Ukraine has pressed criminal charges against Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. The Ukrinform website reports that the statement was published in the Uriadovyi Kuryer government gazette. Prigozhin has been charged with encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine (Article 110 part 3 of the criminal code of Ukraine) and of waging a war of aggression against Ukraine (Article 437 [art 2). In a grim video released over new year, Prigozhin – a long-term ally of Putin – was filmed visiting a basement near the eastern front in Ukraine filled with the bodies of his fighters, many of them convicts, who had been killed during the bitter fighting for the city of Bakhmut, a key Russian objective. There are reports that one person has been killed in a car bomb explosion in occupied Enerhodar in Zaporizhzhia region. The Russian state-owned news agency Tass is quoting Vladimir Rogov, leader of the pro-Russian We are together with Russia movement in occupied Ukraine. He reported on Telegram: “It’s loud in Enerhodar. The cause of the explosion that sounded this morning in the city was a car explosion. According to preliminary data, one person died as a result of the terrorist attack. The fire has now been extinguished. Pyrotechnic teams are checking for the presence of explosives to prevent another explosion.” Enerhodar is the city adjacent to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Dmitri Orlov, Ukraine’s mayor of the city, also posted to Telegram about the incident. He reported that the victim was a former Ukrainian policeman who had defected to work for the occupying Russian authorities. Zaporizhzhia is one of the regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. In his message, Orlov implied that the policemen had been targeted because of criminal and corrupt activities among the occupiers, writing: Since the beginning of March last year and until now, Enerhodar has been a city where the occupiers have been active in criminal activities: they torture and capture people, rob the city’s residents and entire businesses. But they put in their pockets a part of what they receive from the Russian Federation to provide for their needs. Living Rashists do not need … witnesses. Therefore, they will continue to carry out similar “cleanings”. And the first one has already left. None of the claims by either Rogov or Orlov have been independently verified. Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, has posted to Telegram, responding to the Ukrainian president’s comments about the slowing down of western sanctions on Russia. She quotes the media saying “Zelenskiy complained that the pace of sanctions in Europe has slowed down, and Russia has become faster to adapt to restrictions” and goes on to write: Western Europe, falling into recession, having long lost the habit of survival, is sinking, with Ukraine tied to its feet. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne offers this summary of the last 24 hours in its latest bulletin on Telegram. It writes: At night, the Russian military attacked the Barvinkove community in the Kharkiv region. A private house was destroyed and a 70-year-old man was rescued from the rubble. Two men died. Also at night, the Russian army shelled Kherson. They hit one of the shopping centres, a fire started there. People were not injured. Nikopol in the Dnipropetrovsk region also came under fire. There are no dead or injured. Over the past 24 hours, one person was killed by Russian shelling in Donetsk region, and eight others were injured. In the Kherson region, two people were killed in a day, nine more were injured, among them a five-year-old child. The claims have not been independently verified. Here are two images sent over the news wires from Kramatorsk, showing search and rescue operations taking place yesterday. Three people died, eight people were hospitalised with injuries, including two who are in a serious condition, after a building was struck by a Russian missile. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports the latest status update from Ukraine’s regional authority in partially occupied Kherson, one of the areas the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Suspilne posted to its official Telegram channel: During the day of 2 February, the Russian occupiers shelled Kherson oblast 65 times with artillery, anti-aircraft guns, mortars, and tanks. Kherson – 13 times. They targeted a shipbuilding plant, a school and residential buildings. Two people died, nine were injured. Among the injured was a five-year-old boy. EU leaders will seek to cool Ukraine’s expectations of a fast track to membership at a summit with Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday, as the bloc spars over how much encouragement to give its war-torn neighbour. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, are due to meet Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Friday for wide-ranging talks on the war, further sanctions on Russia and integrating Ukraine into the EU’s internal market. It is understood that the EU leaders will seek in private to temper Ukraine’s expectations of a fast-tracked membership, while avoiding negative public statements that could weaken morale and damage Zelenskiy’s efforts to project a European future for Ukrainians. Western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv’s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. Earlier this week, Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, told Politico his country had “a very ambitious plan to join the European Union within the next two years”. For this Friday’s must-read: Guardian correspondents have looked into how Putin’s plans to blackmail Europe over gas supply failed: The worst-case scenarios piled up over the summer months. Germany’s economic minister warned of “catastrophic” industrial shutdowns, fraying supply chains and mass unemployment. France’s president urged citizens to turn down the heating. Spain asked why countries that hadn’t got hooked on Russian gas should bail out neighbours who had lectured them about fiscal discipline in the past. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, meanwhile, gleefully predicted that Europeans would be “freezing in their homes” because they hadn’t thought through the consequences of throwing their support behind Ukraine. “The cold is coming soon,” he said, menacingly, in June last year. But as the European Union enters the last month of the meteorological winter in 2023, signs are becoming clearer that its members have weathered a historic crisis – and not just because “General Frost” has proved a milder adversary than Medvedev predicted. Within eight months of Russian troops setting foot on Ukrainian soil, the bloc of 27 European states replaced about 80% of the natural gas it used to draw through pipelines with Russia, by rapidly building up new infrastructure for liquid natural gas, finding creative ways to help each other out amid shortages, and successfully pursuing energy-saving policies. Read the full story at the link below: The US Central Intelligence Agency director, William Burns, said on Thursday that the Chinese president Xi Jinping’s ambitions toward Taiwan should not be underestimated, despite him likely being sobered by the performance of Russia’s military in Ukraine. Burns said the United States knew “as a matter of intelligence” that Xi had ordered his military to be ready to conduct an invasion of self-governed Taiwan by 2027. “Now, that does not mean that he’s decided to conduct an invasion in 2027, or any other year, but it’s a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and his ambition,” Burns told an event at Georgetown University in Washington. “Our assessment at CIA is that I wouldn’t underestimate President Xi’s ambitions with regard to Taiwan,” he said, adding that the Chinese leader was likely “surprised and unsettled” and trying to draw lessons by the “very poor performance” of the Russian military and its weapons systems in Ukraine. Ukraine’s allies are pushing the International Monetary Fund to finalise plans for a multibillion-dollar lending programme, the Financial Times reported on Friday. IMF representatives are planning to meet Ukrainian officials in mid-February to advance discussions over a loan that could range from $14bn to $16bn, the report said, citing officials familiar with the talks. European Union leaders will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv today, bringing the promise of new sanctions against Russia but likely dashing Ukraine’s hope for swift EU membership, Reuters reports. The head of the group’s executive commission, Ursula von der Leyen, arrived in Kyiv by train on Thursday, a symbolic journey to demonstrate support for Ukraine as the first anniversary of Russia’s 24 February 2022 invasion approaches. Senior members of the EU’s executive met their counterparts in the Ukrainian government, and von der Leyen and the chairman of the 27 EU national leaders, Charles Michel, will convene talks with Zelenskiy on Friday. Zelenskiy called for more punitive measures against Russia by the EU, but new sanctions the bloc is preparing for the anniversary will fall short of his government’s demands. “We see today that the pace of sanctions in Europe has slowed down a little,” Zelensky told a joint news conference alongside European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. “The terrorist state increases the pace of adaptation to sanctions instead. It should be resolved. We believe that we can do it together.” “Russia is paying a heavy price, as our sanctions are eroding its economy, throwing it back by a generation,” Von der Leyen said on Thursday. “By 24 February, exactly one year since the invasion started, we aim to have the 10th package of sanctions in place.” Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next while. Our top story this morning: European Union leaders will meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Friday, bringing the promise of new sanctions against Russia but likely dashing Ukraine and its president’s hopes of swift EU membership. “Russia is paying a heavy price, as our sanctions are eroding its economy, throwing it back by a generation,” Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday. “By 24 February, exactly one year since the invasion started, we aim to have the 10th package of sanctions in place.” Here are the other key recent developments – including what has happened so far at the talks between EU leaders and Zelenskiy: The EU has pledged to double a military aid programme for Ukraine by training an extra 15,000 soldiers as part of a blizzard of announcements aimed at showing it will “stand by Ukraine for the long haul”. Speaking at the start of a two-day trip to Kyiv, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, reiterated that the EU aimed to have a 10th package of sanctions against Russia in place by 24 February. Von der Leyen also reiterated that the EU would cap the price of Russian petroleum products, as part of a broader G7 plan to restrict oil revenues available to the Kremlin’s war machine. The G7 and the EU have already agreed on a price cap on crude oil that came into force last December and, according to Von der Leyen, costs Russia €160m (£143m/$174m) a day. The EU’s 27 member states are yet to agree on the latest oil price cap. The EU also intended to work with Ukrainian prosecutors to set up an international centre for the prosecution of the crime of aggression in Ukraine to be located in The Hague, Von der Leyen said. The purpose of this centre was to collect and store evidence for any future trial, whether that took place via a special tribunal or some other way. The European parliament has voted in support of a roadmap for Ukraine’s accession to the EU. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has said he wanted Ukraine to join the EU in two years, but in reality it was likely to take much longer. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the EU to impose more sanctions on Russia, and said he had discussed a new sanctions package with Von der Leyen. Zelenskiy said the speed of the EU sanctions campaign against Russia had “slightly slowed down” while Russia had been “increasing its pace of adapting to sanctions”. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said sending fighter jets to Ukraine would require “months if not years” of training and that he was looking for the most effective way of helping Kyiv secure victory. Russia is planning a major offensive to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine on 24 February, according to Ukraine’s defence minister. Speaking to French media, Oleksii Reznikov said Russia would call on a large contingent of mobilised troops. Referring to the general mobilisation of 300,000 conscripted soldiers in September, he claimed that numbers at the border suggest the true size could be closer to 500,000. Russia has warned it has “the potential” to respond to western arms deliveries to Ukraine that will not just be about “using armoured vehicles”. In a speech marking the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory against Nazi Germany in the Battle of Stalingrad, Vladimir Putin appeared to allude to Russia’s enormous nuclear weapons arsenal, warning that “those who expect to win on the battlefield apparently do not understand that a modern war with Russia will be utterly different for them”. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has said Russia’s arms suppliers will “significantly” increase their deliveries of military hardware during this year. Medvedev, who is deputy chairman of Russia’s powerful security council and oversees a government commission on arms production, said new supplies would help Russia inflict a “crushing defeat” over Ukraine on the battlefield. Two Russian missiles struck Kramatorsk on Thursday, after an apartment block in the eastern Ukrainian city was hit on Wednesday night, killing at least killing three people and injuring 20. The latest strikes resulted in civilian casualties, said the head of the regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, but it was not clear how many. In addition, two people were killed by Russian shelling in the southern Kherson region. At least eight people died after a fire at a dormitory for construction workers in the Crimean city of Sevastopol, Russian officials said. The fire broke out in temporary accommodation for workers building the Tavrida highway, a road linking the cities of Sevastopol and Simferopol, according to the Russia-installed governor of Sevastopol. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said everybody wanted the conflict in Ukraine to end, but that the west’s support for Kyiv was playing an important role in how Moscow approached the campaign. In an interview on Russia’s state TV, Lavrov also said Moscow had plans to overshadow pro-Ukrainian events arranged by western and allied countries around the world to mark the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. A senior Russian lieutenant who fled after serving in Ukraine has described how his country’s troops tortured prisoners of war and threatened some with rape. “I have personally seen our troops torture Ukrainian soldiers,” Konstantin Yefremov, who is the most senior soldier to speak out against the war, told the Guardian in a phone call. “I feel relieved that I can finally speak out about the things I have seen.” A state-of-the-art missile defence system provided by Italy and France should be up and running in Ukraine within the next two months, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, has said. France and Italy agreed to supply their SAMP/T air defence system to Ukraine, on Kyiv’s request, to help protect the country’s critical infrastructure and cities from the regular barrage of Russian missiles hitting Ukraine. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said he is open to supplying Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets if the decision is taken together with Nato allies. In an interview with Bild, he stressed that his assessment was “based on what Nato countries decide together” and that the decision required the “strategic consideration of the whole” alliance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/10/uk-energy-strategys-nuclear-dangers-and-glaring-omissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-10T17:24:15Z","webTitle":"UK energy strategy’s nuclear dangers and glaring omissions | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/10/uk-energy-strategys-nuclear-dangers-and-glaring-omissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/apr/10/uk-energy-strategys-nuclear-dangers-and-glaring-omissions","fields":{"headline":"UK energy strategy’s nuclear dangers and glaring omissions","bodyText":"Your article (PM to put nuclear power at heart of UK’s energy strategy, 6 April) refers to Sizewell C as one of the major projects that has “already been through some form of planning”. The planning process is still going on, and thousands of interested parties have objected. Six months of Planning Inspectorate meetings exposed the mistakes of trying to build two gigantic reactors in the middle of an area of outstanding natural beauty and site of special scientific interest, pushed against the Minsmere nature reserve, on an eroding coastline, and with no available water for construction or operation, among other problems. This hasn’t stopped Kwasi Kwarteng promising millions in taxpayer funding for Sizewell C when the planning process has not been completed and while he refuses to meet the community to hear alternative views. Josie Bassinette Walberswick, Suffolk • In your major article on the government’s new energy strategy there is no mention of a major reason for opposing more nuclear power: there is still no method of disposing of highly toxic nuclear waste safely. This is hugely irresponsible with regard to future generations, unlike some indigenous Americans like the Iroquois, who have a principle that every plan of action must be considered with regard to its effect on the next seven generations. Morag Carmichael London • In light of Boris’s new enthusiasm for lots of Rolls-Royce’s so-called “mini-nukes” to generate electricity, it should be better known that the Ministry of Defence has not scrapped any of its 21 similarly Rolls-Royce-powered old nuclear submarines, berthed for up to 40 years. It has made a start dismantling the hull of one, but there are still no plans for dealing with the reactors beyond burying them. Indeed, no country in the world has properly made safe a worn out mini-nuke-powered ship or submarine. Bob Cannell Bradford • I would argue that we do not need new nuclear power at all. It is costly, dangerous, slow and unsuitable as an adjunct to renewables. We certainly don’t need it in Wales. In 2021, planning inspectors advised that the Wylfa Newydd development (What might the UK energy strategy contain and how feasible are options?, 6 April) should be rejected due to its impact on the local economy, housing stock, local ecology, nature conservation and the Welsh language. Yet still politicians say it’s the best place for a new nuclear power station. No wonder Boris Johnson wants to cut the “red tape” of the planning process. He cannot be allowed to. Linda Rogers Llangoed, Anglesey • If the government is considering investment in long-term non-fossil energy projects like nuclear, why does its strategy make no mention of tidal power? Proven technology at a variety of suitable sites around the UK could provide baseload renewable electricity. True, the old Severn Barrage scheme raised fears for wildlife, but better design and the realisation that climate change will do far worse damage to wildlife should still such fears. Jon Reeds Alston, Cumbria • A quick win for additional energy supplies should be expansion of anaerobic digestion plants running on waste organic materials. This is a known and improving technology that can be scaled up and built quickly on farms. Organic waste materials can be sourced from farms, food factories, kerbside collections, verge and hedge cutting, etc. This process would be a better use of forestry waste than inefficient burning for electricity as it produces gas for the grid, from where it would be used much more efficiently, and fertiliser that is currently made from fossil fuel gas. CO2 can also be captured to replace that currently made from fossil fuel gas. Malcolm Scott Wirral • There are several glaring omissions from the energy strategy, including our ability to produce energy from waste (EfW) and our ability to sell UK EfW products to UK customers. As a nation, we are embarrassingly behind Europe on this matter, and to our shame we are sending waste either to landfill or to other countries to produce energy from. This, coupled with a ridiculous red tape system in the UK means that we (and companies like ours) are also more likely to sell our EfW pellets to Europe while UK power plants import pellets made from wood from other countries.

France’s prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, announced plans last week to take full control of the power group in an attempt to keep a handle on spiralling household electricity bills. The cost of buying the 16% of EDF shares that the government does not already own, plus any outstanding convertible bonds, could be as high as €10bn, Reuters reported. The reported move pushed EDF shares up by as much as 9.4% in early trading before later settling 6% higher at €10.26, valuing the company at €39.7bn. EDF, which is building the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset, dominates the French electricity market, with the country reliant on it for nuclear power. EDF’s nuclear production accounted for 69% of France’s electricity supplies in 2021. However, this supply level is expected to slump to the lowest level in more than three decades this year due to a combination of maintenance, refuelling and repairs at 12 reactors across France. The French government is trying to reduce its reliance on overseas energy imports as Europe scrambles to keep the lights on this winter. There are growing concerns that Russia will not restart gas supplies into Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline after maintenance started on Monday. It is due to conclude on 21 July. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, described a complete Russian gas cut-off as the “most likely scenario”. France procures about 17% of its gas from Russia but is not as badly affected by disruption to supplies as neighbours such as Germany. Le Maire also said EDF’s chairman and chief executive, Jean-Bernard Lévy, who took the helm in 2014, will step down. Antonio Totaro, a senior director at Fitch Ratings, said the nationalisation is “largely good news” for EDF and the company’s bondholders as it signals the state’s commitment. He said: “EDF has ambitious development plans in the nuclear industry, both in France and abroad – and this nationalisation announcement could be read in parallel with [French president Emmanuel] Macron’s nuclear renaissance aims.” In February, Macron said France would build at least six new nuclear reactors in the next few decades. In the UK, EDF shut down one unit at Hinkley Point B last week and another is due to close on 1 August. Hinkley Point C is not expected to be in operation until 2027 due to construction delays and EDF is awaiting a planning decision on the Sizewell C development in Suffolk, which was last week delayed to 20 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/31/we-need-to-revive-the-uks-nuclear-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-31T16:40:33Z","webTitle":"We need to revive the UK’s nuclear industry | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/31/we-need-to-revive-the-uks-nuclear-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/31/we-need-to-revive-the-uks-nuclear-industry","fields":{"headline":"We need to revive the UK’s nuclear industry","bodyText":"A reply is needed to the letters (23 March) objecting to political parties supporting nuclear power. How can the chairman of the British Energy Efficiency Federation dispute the statement that “electricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade”? Has he not realised that, to meet the climate crisis, the necessary replacement of fossil fuels in road transport and home heating requires electric-powered engines and heat pumps, respectively? Safe underground storage of nuclear waste has been developed. This has never been an insoluble problem. By contrast, little money has been spent on other waste products such as heavy metals, industrial chemicals and plastics. In comparison with nuclear waste, the poisonous effects of heavy metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium never decay with time. We need both nuclear power and power from renewables, the long-term storage of which is a real problem. It is sad that the UK government’s abandonment of support for nuclear industry development in the 1990s has led to the import of expensive foreign reactors. Our country needs a revived nuclear industry based on smaller, much cheaper reactors that are faster to build. Opposition to nuclear power has led to much higher emissions of CO2; for the past 40 years, the emissions from France, whose electricity has been mainly nuclear-powered, have been about 30% less per head than those from Germany. The current abandonment of nuclear power in Germany has not made sense because it has led to more burning of coal and a reliance on imported Russian fuels.

The French finance ministry said on Tuesday it had offered €9.7bn or €12 a share to buy the 16% of debt-laden EDF it does not already own. The government of the French prime minister, Elisabeth Borne, government is trying to shore up domestic energy supplies amid concerns over the finances of the energy company, which is also building the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset. Ministers want to take action to keep energy bills from soaring even higher amid a gas supply crunch in Europe, caused largely by soured relations with big supplier Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The €12-a-share offer is a premium of 53% to the closing value of €7.84 for EDF shares on 5 July, the day before Borne announced the nationalisation. It is also more than the €8bn price tag that emerged last week. Shares in EDF, which had been suspended since 13 July while investors awaited the details of the government plan, jumped 15% to €11.80, valuing the whole company at €45.4bn. “The price is on the high range level taking into account peers and market conditions,” said Gregory Lafitte, an analyst at Tradition. Lafitte added that most estimates for the offer price had ranged from €10.50 to €12.50. The near-€10bn investment represents a sizeable chunk of French government spending. The country’s state budget last year surpassed €400bn, including €60bn on defence spending and €61bn on state pensions. Holders of the company’s convertible debt will be offered €15.64 for each bond, and the final offer for EDF stock will be submitted to Autorité des Marchés Financiers by early September. The nationalisation offers some certainty over EDF’s finances at a crucial juncture for the company. The longstanding chairman and chief executive officer, Jean-Bernard Lévy, 67, is expected to step down as soon as September. EDF’s nuclear production accounted for 69% of France’s electricity supplies in 2021. However, this supply level is expected to fall to the lowest level in more than three decades this year because of a combination of maintenance, refuelling and repairs at 12 reactors. Separately, France agreed a long-term energy deal with the United Arab Emirates on Monday for fuel and gas supplies as it moves to reduce its dependency on Russian gas, which accounted for about 17% of its gas supplies before the war. In the UK, a delayed planning decision on the future of the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power plant, backed by EDF, is due to be announced by the government on Wednesday. Hinkley Point C is not expected to be in operation until 2027 because of construction delays."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-blackouts-likely-across-ukraine-until-march-energy-provider-says","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-22T18:50:27Z","webTitle":"Ukraine’s power grid destroyed on a ‘colossal’ scale after Russian strikes, says energy chief – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-blackouts-likely-across-ukraine-until-march-energy-provider-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-blackouts-likely-across-ukraine-until-march-energy-provider-says","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine’s power grid destroyed on a ‘colossal’ scale after Russian strikes, says energy chief – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The head of Ukraine’s national power grid operator, Ukrenergo, has described the damage dealt to Ukrainian power-generating facilities by Russian missile attacks as “colossal”. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi also dismissed calls to evacuate civilians from some cities worst hit by energy shortages as “inappropriate”. Ukrainians are likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, the head of a major energy provider said, as the government started free evacuations for people in Kherson to other regions. Half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure had been damaged by Russian attacks, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said, leaving millions of people without electricity and water as winter sets in and temperatures drop below freezing. Russia’s Gazprom has threatened to cut its gas flows to Europe via Ukraine as early as next week. In a statement, the Russian state-owned energy giant said some gas flows being kept in Ukraine were actually meant for Moldova, and accused Kyiv of obstructing the delivery of 52.52m cubic metres from transiting to Moldova. Ukraine’s SBU security service and police have raided a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”. Russian shelling hit a humanitarian aid distribution centre in the town of Orihiv in south-eastern Ukraine on Tuesday, killing a volunteer and wounding two women, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Starukh, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, gave no further details of the attack on Orihiv, about 70 miles east of the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station which has been shelled in the past few days. The EU will give a further €2.5bn (£2.2bn) to Ukraine for the reconstruction of the country, the head of the bloc’s executive, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced. Zelenskiy said he was “grateful” and that the aid would make “a strong contribution to the stability of Ukraine on the eve of a difficult winter”. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has warned his country must be prepared for the situation in Ukraine to escalate. This could include the destruction of infrastructure, he added while speaking at a conference in Berlin. Russians have murdered, tortured and kidnapped Ukrainians in a systematic pattern that could implicate top officials in war crimes, the US state department’s ambassador for global criminal justice said Monday. There is mounting evidence that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has been accompanied by systemic war crimes committed in every region where Russian forces have been deployed”, said the US ambassador at large, Beth Van Schaack. Ukraine will summon the ambassador of Hungary to demand an apology after its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, appeared in public wearing a scarf depicting some Ukrainian territory as part of Hungary, the foreign ministry said. The Polish president spoke to a hoax caller pretending to be France’s Emmanuel Macron on the night that a missile hit a village near the Ukrainian border, his office has admitted. “Emmanuel, believe me, I am extra careful,” Duda tells the caller in a recording of the call posted on the internet. “I don’t want to have war with Russia and believe me, I am extra careful, extra careful.” Ukrainian refugees in the UK are experiencing difficulties accessing private rented accommodation because they are unable to secure guarantors or references, the Office for National Statistics has revealed. The World Health Organization has warned that Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days in the war so far”. The WHO regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, called for a “humanitarian health corridor” to be created to all areas of Ukraine newly recaptured by Kyiv, as well as those occupied by Russian forces. Russian troops have been accused of burning bodies at a landfill on the edge of Kherson during their occupation. Residents and workers at the site told the Guardian they saw Russian open trucks arriving to the site carrying black bags that were then set on fire, filling the air with a large cloud of smoke and a stench of burning flesh. Canada has announced new sanctions against Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko’s administration for supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine. The foreign ministry said it would sanction 22 more Belarusian officials as well as 16 Belarusian companies involved in military manufacturing, technology, engineering, banking and railway transportation. The officials included some who were “complicit in the stationing and transport of Russian military personnel and equipment involved in the invasion of Ukraine”. In a statement, the Canadian foreign minister Mélanie Joly accused Lukashenko’s regime of “letting its territory serve as a launching pad for Russia’s egregious attacks against Ukraine”. By doing so, Belarus was “enabling the Russian regime’s human rights violations in places such as Bucha, Izium and Mariupol and contributing to the pain and suffering of millions around the globe that has resulted from President Putin’s weaponization of food and energy”, she continued. Russian-installed officials in the city of Sevastopol in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, said Russian air defences were activated after two drones were shot down. Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Kremlin-installed governor of the Sevastopol, said on Telegram: There is an attack with drones. Our air defence forces are working right now. Two drones had “already been shot down”, he said. No civilian infrastructure had been damaged, he added, urging people to stay calm. Sevastopol is the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea fleet. In October, Russia blamed Ukraine for an attack on the port using air and marine drones. Russia’s Gazprom has threatened to cut its gas flows to Europe via Ukraine as early as next week. In a statement, the Russian state-owned energy giant said some gas flows being kept in Ukraine were actually meant for Moldova, and accused Kyiv of obstructing the delivery of 52.52m cubic metres from transiting to Moldova. It said: The volume of gas supplied by Gazprom ... for transit to Moldova via Ukraine is more than the physical volume transmitted at the border of Ukraine with Moldova. It went on to say that would “begin reducing gas supply” on Monday 28 November if the “transit imbalance through Ukraine for Moldovan consumers persists”. The Ukraine pipeline is the last remaining pipeline still bringing Russian natural gas to western Europe after Gazprom shut off its flows via Nord Stream 1. Ukraine has denied the allegations, saying that all the gas volumes bound to Moldovan consumers have been transferred “in the full amount”. Officials from Iran and Ukraine have met to discuss allegations that Russia is using Iranian-made attack drones in Ukraine, according to a Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson. Earlier this month, Iran acknowledged for the first time that it supplied Moscow with drones but said they were sent before the war in Ukraine. Russia denies its forces have used Iranian drones to attack Ukraine. Oleg Nikolenko told CNN: Such an expert meeting did take place. I cannot disclose the details, but I can assure you that the Ukrainian side continues to take the most drastic measures to prevent the use of Iranian weapons by Russia for the war against Ukraine. He added: Ukraine has informed Iran that the consequences of complicity in the Russian aggression will be incommensurable with the potential benefits of cooperation with Russia. Here are some images we have received from the frontline in Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainians are bracing for what is expected to be the hardest winter in the country’s history. The Ukrainian cold is coming and with it a nightmare for millions as they face it without electricity, water or heating. Ukrainian authorities have warned citizens not to head into the woods without consulting the military, because Russian troops may have left behind mines, tripwires and unexploded shells. But with the price of firewood rising, many have no choice but to take the risk. If a mine doesn’t kill them, the cold might. While people living in houses can burn wood – if they can get it – those who live in flats often rely on old Soviet centralised heating systems. The Russians have bombed many of the country’s thermal power plants, which used to pump hot water into the flats’ radiators. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The head of Ukraine’s national power grid operator, Ukrenergo, has described the damage dealt to Ukrainian power-generating facilities by Russian missile attacks as “colossal”.

Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The Japanese government has announced it will provide Ukraine with generators and solar lanterns as emergency grant aid worth an equivalent of $2.57m (£2.16m). In a statement, it said: The large-scale blackout has occurred in various areas of Ukraine caused by destruction of a large part of energy infrastructure facilities. While the winter gets colder and days get shorter every day in Ukraine, the aid has significant importance as winterisation support for those who cannot use heating facilities and lighting equipment due to the blackout. Japan will continue to “support and stand by” the people of Ukraine “who are facing hardship”, it added. Perched as it is in an upmarket neighbourhood overlooking the scenic Vondelpark, it is not hard to imagine why a Russian billionaire would have been interested in the 1879 five-storey Amsterdam property with a lush private garden. That billionaire was Arkady Volozh, a co-founder of Russia’s biggest search engine, Yandex. He bought the £3m house in 2019, becoming one of the dozens of wealthy Russians who have invested in property in the Dutch capital. But since October, the mansion, which had been undergoing extensive refurbishment, has been taken over by a group of squatters, who issued a statement saying they had done so in a protest against Volozh’s reported ties to the Kremlin, and the wider housing crisis in Amsterdam. Last Wednesday, a Dutch court ruled the squatters did not have to vacate the property. When the Guardian visited the house, it was hung with banners criticising the war in Ukraine. The Guardian was refused entry to the apartment by one of the squatters, who declined to give her name, citing security issues. Lighting a cigarette, the squatter said she was relieved by the judge’s verdict. “The law is finally on our side,” she smiled. Read the full story here: A video message recorded by the Ukrainian Nobel peace laureate, Oleksandra Matviichuk, has been beamed on to the building of the Red Bull Formula One racing headquarters outside London, appealing to the world champion driver Max Verstappen to use his influence to persuade Red Bull to pull out of Russia. Unlike many global brands, Red Bull has refused to cut ties with Putin’s Russia and the energy drink is still on sale in supermarkets across the country. She said: This is a message to Max Verstappen and all Red Bull athletes. My name is Oleksandra Matviichuk, I am a Ukrainian human rights defender and head of the Centre for Civil Liberties. I know that driving a Formula One racing car is dangerous, but for millions of people it’s very dangerous just to be in Ukraine. I am in Kyiv and we, like other Ukrainian cities, are constantly being shelled by Russian rockets. Max, you are a leading brand ambassador of Red Bull. Can you please ask them: why is Red Bull still on sale in Russia while so many global brands have pulled out? Why do Red Bull still continue to help Russia to finance this war? I ask for your support to convince Red Bull to stop their business in Russia. I do believe that Red Bull must abandon Russian money but not people. The Polish president spoke to a hoax caller pretending to be France’s Emmanuel Macron on the night that a missile hit a village near the Ukrainian border, his office has admitted. In a seven-and-a-half minute recording of the call posted on the internet by Russian comedians Vovan and Lexus, Polish president Andrzej Duda can be heard speaking in English to the caller, who attempts to put on a French accent. The call, the second time in recent years that the pranksters from Russia have succeeded in getting through to Duda, came on an evening when the world feared that the conflict in Ukraine could spill beyond its borders, Reuters reported. “Emmanuel, believe me, I am extra careful,” Duda tells the caller. “I don’t want to have war with Russia and believe me, I am extra careful, extra careful.” Duda’s office wrote on Twitter: After the missile explosion in Przewodow, during the ongoing calls with heads of state and government, a person claiming to be French president Emmanuel Macron was connected. During the call, President Andrzej Duda realised from the unusual way the interlocutor conducted the conversation that there might have been an attempted hoax attempt and ended the conversation. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has warned his country must be prepared for the situation in Ukraine to escalate. Speaking at a conference in Berlin hosted by the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, Scholz said: In view of the development of the war and Russia’s visible and growing failures ... we must be ready for an escalation. This could include the destruction of infrastructure, he added. Scholz visited China earlier this month to meet its president, Xi Jinping, a trip he said was worth it alone for spelling out the two countries’ joint stance against using nuclear weapons. In the first visit by a G7 leader to China since the Covid pandemic, Scholz pressed Xi to prevail on Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine. In a readout of the meeting by Chinese state media, Xi agreed that both leaders “jointly oppose the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons” over Ukraine, though he refrained from criticising Russia or calling on Moscow to withdraw its troops. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, has claimed Russia is preparing for a second round of mobilisation in January, with plans to draft up to 700,000 reservists. Moscow called up more than 300,000 soldiers to fight in Ukraine in September, a move that prompted hundreds of thousands of Russian men to flee the country to avoid being conscripted. In a tweet, Gerashchenko said – without providing evidence – that those 300,000 men who had already been drafted had been killed, wounded or demoralised. The Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters yesterday that it was not discussing calling up more Russian soldiers to fight in Ukraine through a second round of mobilisation. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he was “grateful” to the EU and the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, after she announced a further €2.5bn in aid to Ukraine. Zelenskiy said the aid would make “a strong contribution to the stability of Ukraine on the eve of a difficult winter”. Ukrainian refugees in the UK are experiencing difficulties accessing private rented accommodation because they are unable to secure guarantors or references, the Office for National Statistics has revealed. The ONS surveyed nearly 3,000 Ukrainians who fled Russia’s invasion of their country to live in the UK under two visa schemes. The assessment looked at opinions and experiences of those arriving in the UK under the family and “homes for Ukraine” sponsorship schemes. The schemes allow Ukrainian nationals and their family members to come to the UK to live with a named sponsor who can provide accommodation for a minimum of six months. Most respondents say they live with a sponsor – 59% compared with 17% who are renting from a private landlord. However, the ONS said 45% of respondents had experienced barriers to accessing private rented accommodation with “not having a guarantor or references” being the most common reason. Read the full story here: The head of Ukraine’s national power grid operator, Ukrenergo, has described the damage dealt to Ukrainian power-generating facilities by Russian missile attacks as “colossal”. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the chief executive officer of Ukrenergo, told a briefing that practically no thermal or hydroelectric stations had been left unscathed by the Russian attacks. Kudrytskyi said: The scale of destruction is colossal. In Ukraine there is a power generation deficit. We cannot generate as much energy as consumers can use. He said Ukrainians could face long power outages but that his company wanted to help provide the conditions for people to stay in the country through winter. Ukraine had enough fuel reserves after building them up before Russia’s invasion, he said, and was working hard to repair damaged infrastructure but was hoping to secure some spare parts abroad. He dismissed the need to evacuate civilians, after Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced on Monday the evacuation of residents from recently liberated areas of the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. People from the two southern regions, which were shelled regularly by Russian forces in the past months, have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter. Asked about the proposals to evacuate some cities worst hit by energy shortages, Kudrytskyi said such calls were “inappropriate”. Ukraine will summon the ambassador of Hungary to demand an apology after its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, appeared in public wearing a scarf depicting some Ukrainian territory as part of Hungary, the foreign ministry said. Orbán was pictured attending a football match wearing a scarf which the newspaper, Ukrainska Pravda, said showed a map of “Greater Hungary” including territory that is now part of the neighbouring states of Austria, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia, Serbia and Ukraine. In a statement on Facebook, ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said: The promotion of revisionism ideas in Hungary does not contribute to the development of Ukrainian-Hungarian relations and does not comply with the principles of European policy. He added that Ukraine wanted an apology and a rebuttal of any Hungarian claims on Ukrainian territory. The EU will give a further €2.5bn (£2.2bn) to Ukraine for the reconstruction of the country, according to the head of the bloc’s executive, Ursula von der Leyen. Here are some images we have received from Kyiv, where authorities have warned that millions could face power cuts at least until the end of March amid relentless Russian strikes. The Kremlin on Monday said it was not seeking a change of government in Ukraine. When asked by a reporter if one of the goals of a “special military operation” was regime change in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov replied: No [it is not], the president has already spoken about this. The Kremlin has shifted its stated goals in Ukraine throughout the conflict. When Putin announced his “special military operation”, he said in a speech that his country’s aim was to “demilitarise and denazify Ukraine,” indicating his maximalist goals in this war: toppling the government of Ukraine’s elected president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. However, as Russia’s invasion faltered, Putin dramatically scaled back his ambitions, declaring his goal in Ukraine to be the “liberation of Donbas”. Over the past few weeks, the Kremlin has repeatedly said that its goals in Ukraine could also be achieved through negotiations. Other senior Russian officials, however, have continued to push for regime change in Ukraine. Earlier this month, former president Dmitry Medvedev said Moscow should “completely dismantle” Ukraine’s political regime. The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s main stories so far: Ukraine’s SBU security service and police raided a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv early on Tuesday as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”, the SBU said. The Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex that was raided is a Ukrainian cultural treasure and the headquarters of the Russian-backed wing of the Ukrainian Orthodox church known as the Moscow Patriarchate, Reuters reported. Ukrainians are likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, the head of a major energy provider said on Monday, as the government started free evacuations for people in Kherson to other regions. Half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure had been damaged by Russian attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, leaving millions of people without electricity and water as winter sets in and temperatures drop below freezing. Russian shelling hit a humanitarian aid distribution centre in the town of Orihiv in south-eastern Ukraine on Tuesday, killing a volunteer and wounding two women, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Starukh, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, gave no further details of the attack on Orihiv, about 70 miles east of the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station which has been shelled in the past few days. Russians have murdered, tortured and kidnapped Ukrainians in a systematic pattern that could implicate top officials in war crimes, the US state department’s ambassador for global criminal justice said Monday. There is mounting evidence that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has been accompanied by systemic war crimes committed in every region where Russian forces have been deployed”, said the US ambassador at large, Beth Van Schaack. The Ukrainian government has been offering people in the recently liberated city of Kherson, which remains mostly without electricity and running water, free evacuations to regions with better infrastructure, as well as free accommodation. “Given the difficult security situation in the city and infrastructure problems, you can evacuate for the winter to safer regions of the country,” the deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said on the Telegram messaging app. Russia has reiterated that it is not seeking a change of government in Ukraine. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said his country “does not intend the ‘special operation’ to change the government in Ukraine”, Sky News reports. The Kremlin said that no substantive progress had been made towards creating a security zone around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine. Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was rocked by shelling on Sunday, drawing condemnation from the UN nuclear watchdog which said such attacks risked a major disaster. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will in coming days meet the mothers of soldiers amid fierce fighting in Ukraine, the Vedomosti newspaper reported, citing three unidentified sources in the presidential administration. Russia celebrates Mother’s Day on 27 November. The Kremlin has not officially announced any Putin meetings with soldiers’ mothers. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will soon be able to add New Zealand to the list of parliaments he has addressed, after Wellington agreed to a request to do so. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said the government had agreed to the request from the Canberra-based Ukrainian embassy, which serves both countries. Ukraine is to evacuate civilians from recently liberated areas of the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. Residents of the two southern regions have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days in the war so far”. The WHO regional director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, called for a “humanitarian health corridor” to be created to all areas of Ukraine newly recaptured by Kyiv, as well as those occupied by Russian forces. Russian troops have been accused of burning bodies at a landfill on the edge of Kherson during their occupation. Residents and workers at the site told the Guardian they saw Russian open trucks arriving to the site carrying black bags that were then set on fire, filling the air with a large cloud of smoke and a stench of burning flesh. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the time being. I’ll be back at 2pm UK time but my colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to bring you all the latest news from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin said that no substantive progress had been made towards creating a security zone around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-eastern Ukraine.

Russia and Ukraine accused each other of firing the shells that fell near reactors and damaged a radioactive waste storage building at the plant, Reuters reported. “Russian terrorists are shelling humanitarian delivery points, continuing nuclear blackmail – a pitiful tactic of military losers,” Andriy Yermak, chief of the presidential staff, wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “Well, for every such action there is a Ukrainian counteraction,” he added. An image shows the destruction of Kherson International airport in Chornobaivka, located in Kherson oblast, Ukraine. Russia has reiterated that it is not seeking a change of government in Ukraine. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said his country “does not intend the ‘special operation’ to change the government in Ukraine”, Sky News reports. A reporter asked Peskov if one of the goals of the “special military operation” was regime change in Ukraine. “No [it is not], the president has already spoken about this,” Peskov replied. This is in contrast to the beginning of the invasion in February, when Moscow had appeared to be aiming to overthrow the Ukrainian government and install a Russia-friendly regime. Ukraine’s SBU security service and police raided a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv early on Tuesday as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”, the SBU said. The Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex that was raided is a Ukrainian cultural treasure and the headquarters of the Russian-backed wing of the Ukrainian Orthodox church known as the Moscow Patriarchate, Reuters reported. “These measures are being taken … as part of the systemic work of the SBU to counter the destructive activities of Russian special services in Ukraine,” the Security Service of Ukraine said in a statement. It said the search was aimed at preventing the use of the cave monastery as “the centre of the Russian world” and carried out to look into suspicions “about the use of the premises … for sheltering sabotage and reconnaissance groups, foreign citizens, weapons storage”. The SBU did not say what the result of the raid was. The Moscow Patriarchate did not immediately comment. In May, the Ukrainian Orthodox church of the Moscow Patriarchate ended its ties with the Russian church over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and condemned the support of Patriarch Kirill, the head of Russia’s church, for what Moscow calls its “special military operation”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will in coming days meet the mothers of soldiers amid fierce fighting in Ukraine, the Vedomosti newspaper reported, citing three unidentified sources in the presidential administration. Russia celebrates Mother’s Day on 27 November. The Kremlin has not officially announced any Putin meeting with soldiers’ mothers. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov refused to deny or confirm the meeting, Vedomosti said. The UK Ministry of Defence’s update for today reports that Russian and Ukrainian media reported an attack at an oil terminal in Novorssiysk port on Russia’s Black Sea coast on 18 November. More on the winter energy crisis in Ukraine: the Ukrainian government has been offering people in the recently liberated city of Kherson, which remains mostly without electricity and running water, free evacuations to regions with better infrastructure, as well as free accommodation. “Given the difficult security situation in the city and infrastructure problems, you can evacuate for the winter to safer regions of the country,” the deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said on the Telegram messaging app. Zelenskiy urged Ukrainians on Monday to conserve energy, saying they “should be mindful and redistribute their consumption throughout the day”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the blackouts and Russia’s strikes on energy infrastructure are the consequences of Kyiv not willing to negotiate, the state Tass news agency reported late last week. Temperatures in some of Ukraine’s regions have already dropped below freezing, including in the capital of Kyiv. Kovalenko said the country should be prepared for all options, including lengthy power outages. “Stock up on warm clothes, blankets, think about options that will help you wait a long outage,” Kovalenko said. “It’s better to do it now than to be miserable.” That’s it from me for today. My colleague Tom Ambrose will take you through the news for the next while. The Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will soon be able to add New Zealand to the list of parliaments he has addressed, after Wellington agreed to a request to do so. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said the government had agreed to the request from the Canberra-based Ukrainian embassy which serves both countries. “The ask has been made. Happy to accommodate that,” she said, adding that it would be over to a parliamentary committee to find the time. The address is likely to be in the final week of the sitting year, which begins on 13 December. Zelenskiy has given Ardern an invitation to visit Kyiv, which she is yet to take-up. But the defence minister, Peeni Henare, made a 10-hour trip to the Ukrainian capital last weekend. New Zealand has given tens of millions of dollars of aid in support of Ukraine’s resistance to Russia’s invasion, as well as donating military equipment and levying sanctions targeting Russian elites and trade. Russians have murdered, tortured and kidnapped Ukrainians in a systematic pattern that could implicate top officials in war crimes, the US state department’s ambassador for global criminal justice said Monday. There is mounting evidence that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has been accompanied by systemic war crimes committed in every region where Russian forces have been deployed”, said ambassador at large Beth Van Schaack. Evidence from liberated areas indicates “deliberate, indiscriminate and disproportionate” attacks against civilian populations, custodial abuses of civilians and POWs, forceful removal, or filtration, of Ukrainian citizens – including children – to Russia, and execution-like murders and sexual violence, she told reporters. “When we’re seeing such systemic acts, including the creation of a vast filtration network, it’s very hard to imagine how these crimes could be committed without responsibility going all the way up the chain of command,” she said. Van Schaack represents the US to global bodies investigating war crimes and other atrocities, and called the current situation a “new Nuremberg moment”, a reference to the war crimes trials held in the German city at the end of the second world war. She said in a briefing for reporters that Russia’s nine-month-old assault on Ukraine has sparked an “unprecedented array of accountability initiatives”, involving numerous bodies, along with the international criminal court in The Hague. The bodies are coordinating to develop priorities and approaches “under all available jurisdictional bases”, she said. Van Schaack declined to say specifically if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, could be prosecuted for war crimes in Ukraine. But she said prosecutors will “follow the evidence where it leads”. Under international law, the doctrine of superior responsibility allows for prosecutions “to go all the way up the chain of command”, she said. She also said that rights officials are looking closely at a video that emerged over the weekend that suggests Ukrainian troops may have killed Russian prisoners of war. Ukrainians are most likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, the head of a major energy provider said on Monday, as the government started free evacuations for people in Kherson to other regions. Half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been damaged by Russian attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, leaving millions of people without electricity and water as winter sets in and temperatures drop below freezing. Sergey Kovalenko, head of the YASNO major private energy provider for Kyiv, said that workers are rushing to complete repairs before the winter cold arrives. “I would like everyone to understand: Ukrainians will most likely live with blackouts until at least the end of March,” Kovalenko said in a post on his Facebook page. He added: The basic scenario is that if there are no new attacks on the power grid, then under current conditions of electricity generation, the power deficit could be evenly distributed across the country. This means the outages will be everywhere but less lasting. There are also different forecasts of the development of this situation, and they completely depend on attacks Russia.” Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next while. Ukrainians are most likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, the head of a major energy provider said late on Monday. Sergey Kovalenko, head of the YASNO major private energy provider for Kyiv, said that workers are rushing to complete repairs before the winter cold arrives. “I would like everyone to understand: Ukrainians will most likely live with blackouts until at least the end of March,” Kovalenko said in a post on his Facebook page. More on this soon. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Ukraine is to evacuate civilians from recently liberated areas of the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. Residents of the two southern regions have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter. The Kremlin said it was concerned by what it claimed to be Ukrainian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is under Russian control. Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine’s defence minister, countered that the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant was a Russian tactic aiming to disrupt power supplies and “freeze Ukrainians to death”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed to Nato members to guarantee the protection of his country’s nuclear power plants from “Russian sabotage”. The UN nuclear watchdog was to conduct an assessment of the Zaporizhzhia plant on Monday. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the forces behind its shelling were “playing with fire” and such attacks risked a major disaster. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days in the war so far”. WHO regional director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, called for a “humanitarian health corridor” to be created to all areas of Ukraine newly recaptured by Kyiv, as well as those occupied by Russian forces. Ukraine’s prosecutor general office has said its officials have identified four locations where Russian forces tortured detainees in Kherson city. It said Russian forces “set up pseudo-law enforcement agencies” in pre-trial detention centres and a police station before troops withdrew from the southern Ukrainian city. Russian troops have been accused of burning bodies at a landfill on the edge of Kherson during their occupation. Residents and workers at the site told the Guardian they saw Russian open trucks arriving to the site carrying black bags that were then set on fire, filling the air with a large cloud of smoke and a stench of burning flesh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-176-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T18:30:57Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 176 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-176-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-176-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 176 of the invasion","bodyText":"The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN met to review the grain export deal in Lviv, as well as to discuss the rising tensions at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, and Volodymyr Zelenskiy agreed upon the parameters of a possible mission led by the International Atomic Energy Agency to the power plant, with Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, warning of the dangers of “another Chornobyl”. In the meeting, Guterres told Zelenskiy of a UN fact-finding mission to Olenivka in Donetsk to investigate allegations of Russian mistreatment against Ukrainian prisoners of war. Zelenskiy asked Guterres also to investigate “the issue of compliance by the Russian side with the agreements reached in the context of the withdrawal of Ukrainian defenders from Azovstal”. Erdoğan signed a memorandum with Ukraine to help reconstruct infrastructure destroyed by the war. “While continuing our efforts to find a solution, we remain on the side of our Ukraine friends,” he said. At least 15 people were killed in a series of Russian missile strikes on Kharkiv that took place late Wednesday and early Thursday morning, Ukraine’s state emergencies services said. Zelenskiy called the attack a “devious and cynical strike on civilians with no justification”. He said: “We will not forgive, we will take revenge.” Russia has warned it may shut down the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant if Ukraine continues to shell the facility – a claim Kyiv has denied. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s military intelligence believes Russia is planning a “provocation” at the nuclear power plant on Friday, by announcing an unexpected “day off” and closing entry to all other employees. Scientists with the Ukrainian Hydrometeorology Institute simulated the radiation spread of a nuclear disaster and found that with the weather conditions of the past few days, radioactive contaminants could reach as far north as the Baltic Sea, hitting Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland along the way, as well as Belarus. Heading west, radioactive contaminants could enter Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Estonia has been hit by extensive cyber-attacks after removing a Soviet-era tank monument from a region whose population is predominantly ethnic Russian, its government has said. Russian hacker group Killnet claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said blocked access to more than 200 state and private Estonian institutions, but the Estonian government said the impact of the attack was limited and went “largely unnoticed”. The Russian military announced it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the country’s Kaliningrad region, a move that has been broadly interpreted as a response to the west arming Ukraine. The Kinzhal hypersonic missiles have a range of up to 2,000km (1,2oo miles) and fly at 10 times the speed of sound, making it hard to intercept, the Russian military said. Russia has used the weapon to strike several targets in Ukraine. Russia has replaced the commander of its Crimea-based Black Sea fleet after explosions rocked the peninsula this week. Russia’s RIA news agency cited sources as saying Igor Osipov had been replaced with Viktor Sokolov. If confirmed, it would mark one of the most prominent sackings of a military official in the war so far. Chinese troops will travel to Russia to take part in joint military exercises “unrelated to the current international and regional situation”, China’s defence ministry has said. Other countries will include India, Belarus, Mongolia and Tajikistan. In July, Moscow announced plans to hold “Vostok” exercises from 30 August to 5 September. Ukrainian authorities performed disaster response drills near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Wednesday. This followed repeated shelling at the Russian-occupied plant, the largest of its kind in Europe. The main bridge connecting Crimea to the Russian mainland must be “dismantled”, the Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said. The 19-km (12-mile) Kerch Bridge is Moscow’s key military and civilian land corridor to the peninsula. “The bridge is an illegal object,” Podolyak said. It “must therefore be dismantled. Not important how – voluntary or not”, implying the bridge could become a military target for Ukrainian forces. The top official in Russian-annexed Crimea has claimed the FSB security service has broken up a six-person terrorist cell of a banned Islamist group. It followed a series of strikes on Russian bases and other infrastructure across the region that Russia has sought to blame on sabotage. At least 12 Russians were reportedly killed in a strike on a base in the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka, according to the Ukrainian military. Footage posted to Telegram by the state border guard service showed numerous burnt-out trucks, collapsed buildings, and debris. Ukraine has not lost any US-supplied Himars rocket launchers, the Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said in contradiction to Russian claims. Ukraine has received at least 20 of the US-made launchers, and has used them to attack Russian ammunition depots, command posts, and air defences. The mayor of the village of Verkhnyo Rogachytsk in the Kherson region has been kidnapped, according to the deputy chair of the regional council. Yuri Sobolevsky said Svitlana Ivanivna was taken from her home at about 11am on Tuesday. The first wartime shipment of UN food aid for Africa reached the Bosphorus Strait on Wednesday under a UN-backed deal to restore Ukrainian grain deliveries across the Black Sea. Marine traffic sites showed the MV Brave Commander taking its cargo of 23,000 tonnes of wheat across the heart of Istanbul bound for its final destination in Djibouti next week. Canada has disbursed C$450m ($348m) in loans for the purchase of heating fuel before winter for Ukraine, the finance minister in Ottawa, Chrystia Freeland, has announced. Russia foresees a 38% rise in energy export earnings this year due to higher oil export volumes, coupled with rising gas prices, according to an economy ministry document seen by Reuters.

The Russian gas export monopoly said it was halting the operation of one of the last two operating turbines due to the “technical condition of the engine”, cutting daily gas deliveries via the Nord Stream pipeline to 33m cubic metres a day – about 20% of the pipeline’s capacity. “We are monitoring the situation very closely in close exchange with the federal network agency and the gas crisis team,” the German economy ministry said in a statement on Monday after Gazprom’s announcement. “According to our information, there is no technical reason for a reduction in deliveries.” Zelenskiy, in his nightly video address on Monday, said the move was deliberate and urged the European Union to agree tougher sanctions against Russia. “All this is done by Russia on purpose to make it as difficult as possible for Europeans to prepare for winter. And this is an open gas war that Russia is waging against a united Europe,” he said. Moscow’s “gas blackmail of Europe” represented “an incentive for the EU’s eighth sanctions package to be significantly stronger,” he said. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline resumed pumping last week, after a 10-day maintenance break, but the European Commission has warned that a complete gas shut down by Russia is likely. The announcement came as EU governments sparred over a plan for a 15% gas savings target intended to avoid a winter crisis if the Kremlin turns off the taps to Europe. The EU’s goal is to use less gas now to build storage for winter. The EU executive last week accused Moscow of using energy as a “weapon” and called on 27 member states to accept a voluntary 15% gas savings target, which could become mandatory if Brussels declares a supply emergency. EU officials had hoped the bloc’s 27 energy ministers meeting in Brussels on Tuesday would rubber stamp the 15% gas savings plan. Instead countries from all corners of Europe have raised objections, led by Spain and Portugal, who are relatively isolated from the EU’s gas pipeline network. The proposals have been seen as designed for Germany, which faces energy rationing as it scrambles to undo decades of dependence on Russian gas. In an echo of the bruising debates of the eurozone crisis ten years ago, where arguments raged over bailouts, debt and blame, southern countries suggested their citizens should not have to make sacrifices for the past policies of others. Spain’s deputy prime minister Teresa Ribera said last week her country was being asked to make a “disproportionate sacrifice”, as she pointed to investments her country had made on liquefied natural gas infrastructure, costs that had fallen on Spanish companies and consumers, she said. “Unlike other countries, we Spaniards have not lived beyond our means from an energy point of view,” Ribera said in unusually pointed comments. Portugal was “totally against” the proposals its energy minister, João Galamba, told local media last week, saying they did not address the needs of Spain or Portugal, which have little gas interconnection with the rest of Europe. The Iberian countries are also using more gas to generate electricity because a fierce drought has reduced hydropower production. Greece also opposes the 15% EU-wide target, which it argues overburdens its economy and consumers. Meanwhile, Poland has raised concerns about its energy security. A Polish official said Warsaw would “not agree to any solutions that may lead to the use of Polish natural gas reserves for the needs of other member states”. France, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands and Poland were among the countries that opposed giving the commission the power to declare a supply emergency. Instead it is proposed that EU member states make that critical decision. Under revised proposals, which were still being discussed by EU deputy ambassadors on Monday, countries can get an exemption from the 15% target if they are not connected to the gas interconnector system of any other member states. The target can also be eased if countries offer to send gas to a member state in need. EU sources rejected suggestions the plan was designed for Germany, arguing all member states would feel the economic pain of a Russian gas shut down. “I don’t buy the logic that all this is for Germany,” said one senior EU official. “It’s not about who will be hit first because if [a supply shock] hits then I think the problem will be immediately shared. We are in the internal market and … the pain will be substantial for all member states.” The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, last week said it was likely the Kremlin would order a complete shutdown of Russian gas to the EU, dealing a hammer blow to the European single market. EU officials have suggested countries speed up the shift to renewables, but have also said states could consider delay to exiting coal and nuclear power. Belgium’s government announced last week it had reached a political agreement to extend the life of two nuclear power plants by 10 years, citing national security. The Doel 4 and Tihange 3 reactors will be restarted in 2026, as the Belgian government revised a plan to exit all nuclear power by 2025."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/10/chris-oshea-centrica-chief-executive-with-a-decarbonising-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-10T15:00:06Z","webTitle":"Chris O’Shea: Centrica chief executive with a decarbonising plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/10/chris-oshea-centrica-chief-executive-with-a-decarbonising-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/10/chris-oshea-centrica-chief-executive-with-a-decarbonising-plan","fields":{"headline":"Chris O’Shea: Centrica chief executive with a decarbonising plan","bodyText":"Even for an executive in the eye of the gathering storm that is the energy crisis, Chris O’Shea seems remarkably busy. The chief executive of Centrica bustles on to our videocall from offices in Easington, East Yorkshire, after battling traffic on his way from a hydrogen project in the Humber. Afterwards he’s off to the coast, to check progress on reopening the massive Rough undersea gas storage facility – a key part of ensuring the UK will be able to keep the lights on as Russia throttles gas supplies. He has also found time to watch Liz Truss announce her energy bills bailout on the TV. Her plan involves reworking power supply contracts, a measure O’Shea, along with other industry leaders, has been pushing for. Tomorrow brings an early morning trip to Brigg power station in north Lincolnshire, where the company is building a 50-megawatt battery storage plant. He’s not complaining, though. “Having to work two jobs to make ends meet, that’s a struggle,” says O’Shea, crunching on a bag of salt- and-vinegar crisps as he hurries his lunch. “It’s a massive privilege to be in the position I’m in.” *** CV Age 48 Family Married with three children.

Best advice he’s been given “You’ve two eyes, two ears and one mouth: try to use them in proportion.” Phrase he overuses “Do you have five minutes?” How he relaxes Spending time with friends and family; running. *** Centrica is the largest UK company supplying power into its home market, with 8 million domestic and retail customers. It owns British Gas, the former state monopoly, and is valued at more than £5bn. Its stock has risen more than 70% over the past year, thanks to surging gas prices, and half-year profits were a thumping £1.3bn. Its assets span gasfields in the North and Irish seas, solar projects and a stake in UK nuclear power. O’Shea shrugs off public anger that has seen him vilified for high pay (potentially £4.26m this year), for still working some of the time from home and for cutting jobs – he even had faeces sent to his home near Reading: “It would be very self-indulgent to feel sorry for myself. I’m in a very fortunate position.” Later, he adds: “My brother took his life when he was 25 – that is the toughest challenge I have overcome. A personal tragedy puts everything else into perspective.” O’Shea joined the British Gas owner as finance chief in 2018, moving to the top job in April 2020. Since then, he’s navigated Covid, slashed 5,000 jobs at the former state monopoly, and taken on 800,000 customers from suppliers put out of business by surging gas prices. Now, he’s in talks with government over a voluntary profits cap and is eyeing a push into more nuclear power. Centrica owns a 20% stake in Britain’s ageing nuclear facilities through a joint venture with France’s EDF. Having flirted with selling that stake, the British firm dropped that plan last year. Despite pulling out of the project to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset with EDF a decade ago, Centrica has been linked with investing in its sister site in Suffolk, Sizewell C. O’Shea confirms this interest for the first time, saying he is seriously considering investing in the project. In one of his final acts as prime minister, Boris Johnson said that Britain was “putting up to £700m” into the project, which could cost £30bn to build. The government and EDF are understood to be finalising a deal that would see each take a 50% stake in a new vehicle while external investors are sought, pushing out China’s CGN in the process. “I’m very interested in understanding the terms of the agreement between EDF and the government,” says O’Shea. “If those terms are attractive, I would very much like to be involved in Sizewell C, but I need to see the terms and have a conversation, obviously, with my colleagues on the board. But it’s fully aligned with our strategy.” He says “some of our fears have come to pass in terms of cost overruns and delays” at Hinkley Point C, but backs EDF. “I’ve been in large capital projects myself. Things go wrong. But at good companies, when they go wrong, you learn from them.” O’Shea says he is “committed to delivering decarbonisation” by the government net zero target date of 2050 or earlier. He says: “The reality is, I believe in a decarbonised UK: that requires more wind power, more solar power, more nuclear power, and decarbonised gas.” He is even tempted by a project to build a fleet of mini nuclear plants in the UK. “I am interested in understanding a bit more about the small modular reactors that Rolls-Royce is developing. So that’s something that we would potentially look at as well.” A push into costly nuclear projects would be a bold new frontier for a self-confessed “disciplined” numbers man. Born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, O’Shea studied accountancy in Glasgow, where he had moved after his parents’ business hit hard times. He has rattled through a series of finance roles with corporate big beasts including Ernst &amp; Young, Shell, BG Group and Smiths Group, and done stints in the US and Nigeria, where his uncle was once a priest.

He’s not too downcast after Celtic FC, whose matches he still watches with schoolmates, lost to Real Madrid. Not content just to be a spectator, he’s preparing to run the Berlin marathon this month. Despite Truss’s intervention, this winter remains uncertain for many. O’Shea urges customers to wait until they receive their bills before inundating call centres. He says Downing Street should be “applauded” for the support, adding: “This is a two-year temporary programme, and it gives us time to fix the underlying causes of the issue.” His solution is to voluntarily give the government a slice of the outsize profits Centrica has made from its nuclear stake and its North Sea gas operations, to pay for lower bills. He is in negotiations with civil servants now about how to do that. Isn’t this merely a strategy to avoid being slapped with a more punitive windfall tax? “A windfall tax by its nature is a one-off,” he says. “It doesn’t fix the structure of the market. We’re trying to solve the same issue in a way that’s sustainable.” In one of her first acts as prime minister, Truss reopened the door to fracking. O’Shea welcomes the new policy, which will allow companies to drill – if they win approval from local residents. “It’s absolutely right: you should look at it because, again, it helps with energy security.” But would he oppose fracking near his own home? “If I was publicly in support of fracking, I couldn’t find it in my conscience to object.” • This article was amended on 11 &amp; 12 September: to correct details about O’Shea’s pay and to note that he was speaking from offices in Easington, East Yorkshire, not Easington, County Durham as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/apr/02/johnson-to-bet-big-on-nuclear-energy-despite-sunaks-reservations","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-02T06:00:43Z","webTitle":"Johnson to ‘bet big’ on nuclear energy despite Sunak’s reservations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/02/johnson-to-bet-big-on-nuclear-energy-despite-sunaks-reservations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/apr/02/johnson-to-bet-big-on-nuclear-energy-despite-sunaks-reservations","fields":{"headline":"Johnson to ‘bet big’ on nuclear energy despite Sunak’s reservations","bodyText":"Boris Johnson wants his promised energy security strategy to “bet big” on nuclear despite Rishi Sunak’s reservations – but he has cooled on more onshore wind turbines in England amid a Conservative backlash. The prime minister is determined to press ahead with plans to build up to eight new nuclear power stations even though the chancellor has concerns about the cost, projected to reach more than £13bn. It is understood the energy strategy, expected to be announced next week, is likely to contain targets for nuclear but will not put a figure on the cost. Johnson will also commit to a “stretching” target on offshore wind, according to a Whitehall source. But he is now said to be less enthusiastic about the possibilities of onshore wind in England, believing Scotland offers a better landscape for new turbines. One ally of the prime minister said he would “not really [be] pushing for onshore wind in England” although it would “be in the strategy as an option where people want it, which realistically means in Scotland”. Johnson and Sunak are understood to have discussed the new strategy this week, which was commissioned to ensure security of supply amid soaring gas prices fuelled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The document was delayed owing to a row over the scale of its ambitions on nuclear, but is now likely to be published at the end of next week. Sunak will be in London for the launch of the strategy. However, he is reported to be going on holiday in California, where he has a second home, at some point over parliamentary recess, despite rising pressure over the lack of measures to help with the cost of living and energy bills in the spring statement. The Treasury is understood to have concerns about expanding nuclear power in the UK, with the cost of new plants due to be loaded on to people’s energy bills under the fresh funding system. The government would also be likely to take minority stakes in new projects, and has set aside an estimated £1.7bn on getting one plant, Sizewell C, in a position to go ahead. But with a renewed focus on weaning the UK off gas, Johnson is insistent on the need to press ahead with new plants, with a draft target of around 16GW of nuclear power in the medium term and closer to 30GW in the longer term. According to the government’s own impact assessment, it takes on average 13 to 17 years from initial investment to electricity being generated by a new nuclear plant. On onshore wind, allies of No 10 had described Johnson as “open-minded”, but “passionate about offshore”. He appears to have cooled on the prospect of more onshore wind, as well as the potential for fracking in England, because Tory MPs are resisting developments in their constituencies. The idea of giving communities discounts on their energy bills if they accept onshore developments in their areas has been mooted, meaning the prospect of new developments is “not impossible”, but still difficult, sources said. However, Johnson has been giving out mixed messages on onshore wind after telling a group of industry leaders this week that he was “horrified” how long the planning process takes. He was told that a wind turbine can be put up in a day, but planning permission can take a decade. Officials expect No 10 will approve an energy bill to set targets and strategy for energy security, to be announced in the Queen’s speech in May. The UK has struggled to build new nuclear power stations in recent decades, with the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi in 2020 pulling out of plans to build a new reactor at Wylfa, north Wales, and a move against allowing Chinese investment in Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/22/its-half-of-what-was-shot-at-us-kharkivs-russian-missile-cemetery","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-22T14:16:40Z","webTitle":"‘It’s half of what was shot at us’: Kharkiv’s Russian missile cemetery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/22/its-half-of-what-was-shot-at-us-kharkivs-russian-missile-cemetery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/22/its-half-of-what-was-shot-at-us-kharkivs-russian-missile-cemetery","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s half of what was shot at us’: Kharkiv’s Russian missile cemetery","bodyText":"During the first few months of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the cruise missiles fired by Moscow at its neighbour remained embedded for days at a time in the buildings and streets of the north-eastern province Kharkiv. Then, one by one, officials working for Ukrainian prosecutors recovered, registered and catalogued them, before moving them to a fenced-off area in an industrial district of Kharkiv city that has become known as the “missile cemetery”. More than 1,000 explosives and the debris of rockets are lined up in rows, covering an area half the size of a football field. Ukraine’s army calculates that Russia has fired more than 5,000 cruise missiles, in addition to countless artillery rockets, since the war began. A large number have fallen on Kharkiv. Local authorities say that one day the devices could become part of a museum to remember the atrocities of war. In the meantime, though, they hope the debris can provide information to help bring prosecutions against Russian authorities and soldiers. “This place was created for collecting evidence of war crimes,” said Dmytro Chubenko, the spokesperson for the Kharkiv region prosecutor’s office. “These devices were all found in Kharkiv city. But it is approximately only half of what they shot at us. These are pieces of evidence that we hope will be used in the international criminal court.” About 95% of all the devices stored in the missile cemetery are parts of multiple launch rocket systems, including Smerch systems that can be used to carry cluster bombs, which were banned by most of the world under a 2008 treaty and have been used by Russia in areas of Ukraine where there were neither military personnel nor military infrastructure. By analysing the types of devices fired, their flight paths and the GPS locations of where they landed, prosecutors in Kharkiv have placed dozens of Russian soldiers and officials under investigation, including Col Gen Alexander Zhuravlyov, who also took part in Russia’s 2016 bombing campaign against Syria. According to multiple reports, Zhuravlyov was the only senior Russian officer who could sign off an order to launch a Smerch rocket attack on Kharkiv. Chubenko said the study and analysis of munitions was crucial to investigating responsibility for alleged crimes on Ukrainian soil. Munitions are marked with a series of codes denoting the manufacturer, details of refurbishment if applicable, and more rarely the military unit that handled maintenance. “You can see the digits and letters which these missiles are marked with,” Chubenko said. “With the help of those we could identify which plant produced them and sometimes which military unit stored and maintained them.” Neil Corney is a research associate at the Omega Research Foundation, an independent organisation based in the UK dedicated to providing evidence-based information about the manufacture, trade and use of military, security and police technologies. He said identifying the unit that stored missiles and rockets was key to investigating potential war crimes. “Ideally, if you want to link the use of the munition to a crime then you need to show its chain of custody,” said Corney. This chain includes where the munition was stored and maintained, its distribution to a military unit, its use, its location at the site of a potential crime, and the secure storage of its remains. In the Kharkiv missile cemetery, prosecutors have stored some of the missiles that hit residential areas in north Saltivka and Oleksiyivka. They have singled out a Russian general, whose name cannot be disclosed due to an ongoing investigation, who allegedly gave an order to launch at least 100 missiles from Russian-occupied northern Ukraine into the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, a hotbed of early nuclear research in the former Soviet Union. Although the facility does not present a radiation threat, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has said that the scale and intensity of attacks on the institute “violates all the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars I outlined at the beginning of the conflict”. Chubenko said the consequences of the missile attacks could have been drastic. “Of course the Russians were aware of the nuclear research reactor being located there since it was built in the Soviet times and Rosatom [the Russian state nuclear power company] has got all the blueprints,” he added. Oleksandr Filchakov, the chief prosecutor for Kharkiv, said thousands of potential war crime and other criminal proceedings had been opened against Russian soldiers and officials in his province alone. Authorities estimate that more than 1,700 people have been killed by Russian shelling, including 44 children, in Kharkiv city and its surroundings. Nationwide, the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) has recorded 21,965 civilian casualties since the beginning of the Russian invasion, including 8,231 deaths. The OHCHR has noted that the actual casualty figures are much higher due to a delay in receiving information from locations experiencing intense hostilities. Reports are still pending corroboration in places including Mariupol, Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/15/jeremy-hunt-windfall-tax-electricity-generators","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-15T11:18:14Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt ‘lining up new 40% windfall tax on electricity generators’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/15/jeremy-hunt-windfall-tax-electricity-generators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/15/jeremy-hunt-windfall-tax-electricity-generators","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Hunt ‘lining up new 40% windfall tax on electricity generators’","bodyText":"Jeremy Hunt is reportedly preparing to hit electricity generation companies with a 40% windfall tax on their “excess returns” as he attempts to fund measures to ease the cost of living crisis. The chancellor is considering a levy on the extra profits made by generators above a certain price per megawatt hour, which has yet to be decided. Hunt is also planning to toughen the existing windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators, raising the tax from 25% to 35% and extending it by two years until 2028. The two windfall taxes are expected to generate £45bn over six years depending on movements in energy prices, according to the Financial Times. The North Sea windfall tax had been forecast to raise around £28bn over four years. The move to curb the profits on electricity generators represents a departure from the former prime minister Liz Truss’s plan to cap the revenues of renewable and nuclear power producers from next year, in line with the EU’s “revenue cap”. Officials have spent more than six months examining methods of taxing electricity generators, which have enjoyed big profits on the back of soaring power prices – linked to the rising wholesale cost of natural gas – while their costs remained largely stable. The government has worked on plans to shift companies on a voluntary basis to contracts for difference, which cap their revenues but guarantee them a long-term income. However, the generation industry has been split on which scheme they favour. Industry sources said generators have increasingly indicated that a one-off windfall tax would be preferable to the uncertainty of options linked to volatile energy prices. “The suggestion has been that the options are simply too complex, and a straightforward windfall tax would give more certainty over the future for investors,” said one energy executive. There are fears that a tax on renewable companies could deter investors from backing large-scale green energy projects. The energy generator SSE has said a windfall tax could damage Britain’s progress on building up domestic sources of electricity. Hunt is expected to present the toughened windfall tax in his autumn statement on Thursday. He is also likely to announce changes to the energy price guarantee, which caps a typical household bill at £2,500. In one of his first acts as chancellor, Hunt shortened Truss’s two-year policy to cut energy bills to six months. He is expected to keep protection in place for millions of vulnerable low-income households and pensioners."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/11/russia-ukraine-war-first-wheat-shipments-to-leave-next-week-un-to-discuss-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-crisis-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-11T18:00:24Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: invasion ‘starting to fail’ and Russian forces suffering huge losses, says UK – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/11/russia-ukraine-war-first-wheat-shipments-to-leave-next-week-un-to-discuss-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-crisis-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/11/russia-ukraine-war-first-wheat-shipments-to-leave-next-week-un-to-discuss-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-crisis-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: invasion ‘starting to fail’ and Russian forces suffering huge losses, says UK – as it happened","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is 9pm. Here is a round-up of today’s headlines: The British defence secretary has said Vladimir Putin is now unlikely to succeed in occupying Ukraine. Ben Wallace said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “faltered” and was “starting to fail”, as he pledged more financial and military support to the eastern European nation’s defence. There have been conflicting reports of continued shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company said it had been shelled ten times by Russian forces on Thursday, resulting in staff being unable to change shifts. Energoatom said the plant was operating normally. However, Russian news agency Tass reported that the local Russian-imposed authorities in occupied Zaporizhzhia said the plant had been fired upon by Ukrainian forces. Russian-imposed authorities in Zaporizhzhia region have also claimed Thursday that anti-aircraft defence systems thwarted Ukrainian attacks on the occupied city of Enerhodar. None of the claims have been independently verified. The United States supports calls for a demilitarised zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after fighting involving Russian and Ukrainian forces in the vicinity of the plant, a State Department spokesperson said on Thursday. “Fighting near a nuclear plant is dangerous and irresponsible and we continue to call on Russia to cease all military operations at or near Ukrainian nuclear facilities and return full control to Ukraine, and support Ukrainian calls for a demilitarised zone around the nuclear power plant,” the spokesperson said. Ukraine aims to evacuate two thirds of residents from areas it controls in the eastern battleground region of Donetsk before winter, partly out of concern people won’t be able to stay warm amid war-damaged infrastructure, the deputy prime minister said on Thursday. The government plans to evacuate some 220,000 people out of around 350,000, including 52,000 children, Iryna Vereshchuk told a news conference. Ukraine expects $3bn of US financial aid to arrive in August and a further $1.5bn in September, its finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, said on Thursday. Marchenko said the payments were part of the $7.5bn financial aid package agreed by Ukraine and the US at the start of the summer and would be used to finance “critical spending” such as healthcare and pension costs. Belarus has said that blasts heard overnight at one of its military bases 19 miles from Ukraine were caused by a “technical incident.” At least eight explosions were heard after midnight near Zyabrovka military airport, according to reports on Telegram messenger. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. McDonald’s will start reopening some of its restaurants in Ukraine in the coming months, in a show of support after the American fast-food chain pulled out of Russia. The burger giant closed its Ukrainian restaurants after Russia’s invasion nearly six months ago but has continued to pay more than 10,000 McDonald’s employees in the country. On Wednesday, Ukraine accused Russia of firing rockets from around the captured plant, killing at least 13 people and wounding 10, knowing it would be risky for Ukraine to return fire. Ukraine says Russia targeted the town of Marhanets, which Moscow says Ukraine has used in the past to shell Russian soldiers at the plant, which Russia seized in March. Calling on foreign allies to send more powerful weapons, Zelenskiy said in a late-night video address that Kyiv “will not leave today’s Russian shelling of the Dnipropetrovsk region unanswered”, and vowed to inflict as much damage on Russia as possible to end the war quickly. Ukraine’s air force said it believed up to a dozen Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground in Tuesday’s dramatic explosions at the Saky airbase in Crimea, which Russia said killed one, wounded 13 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Political sources in Ukraine said it had carried out the attack, but Kyiv did not publicly claim responsibility. One expert said it may have been the product of a daring raid rather than a missile strike. Russia has doubled the number of air strikes on Ukraine’s military positions and civilian infrastructure compared with the previous week, Ukrainian brigadier general Oleksiy Hromov said. “The enemy’s planes and helicopters avoid flying into the range of our air defences, and therefore the accuracy of these strikes is low,” he told a news conference. That’s it from the Ukraine live blog for today. I’ll be back tomorrow but for now, it’s goodnight from me. McDonald’s will start reopening some of its restaurants in Ukraine in the coming months, in a show of support after the American fast-food chain pulled out of Russia. The burger giant closed its Ukrainian restaurants after Russia’s invasion nearly six months ago but has continued to pay more than 10,000 McDonald’s employees in the country. McDonald’s said on Thursday that it would begin gradually reopening some restaurants in western Ukraine and the capital, Kyiv, where other American businesses including Nike and KFC, and Spanish clothing retailer Mango are open. “We’ve spoken extensively to our employees who have expressed a strong desire to return to work and see our restaurants in Ukraine reopen,” Paul Pomroy, corporate senior vice-president of international markets, said in a message to staff. “In recent months, the belief that this would support a small but important sense of normalcy has grown stronger.” Ukraine aims to evacuate two thirds of residents from areas it controls in the eastern battleground region of Donetsk before winter, partly out of concern people won’t be able to stay warm amid war-damaged infrastructure, the deputy prime minister said on Thursday. The government plans to evacuate some 220,000 people out of around 350,000, including 52,000 children, Iryna Vereshchuk told a news conference. Late last month Ukraine announced the mandatory evacuation of people from Donetsk region, which has been the scene of fierce fighting with Russia, to save civilian lives, Reuters reported. Although the authorities describe the evacuation as “mandatory”, residents can opt out by filling in a form declaring their intention to stay. The United States supports calls for a demilitarised zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after fighting involving Russian and Ukrainian forces in the vicinity of the plant, a State Department spokesperson said on Thursday. “Fighting near a nuclear plant is dangerous and irresponsible and we continue to call on Russia to cease all military operations at or near Ukrainian nuclear facilities and return full control to Ukraine, and support Ukrainian calls for a demilitarised zone around the nuclear power plant,” the spokesperson said. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres earlier on Thursday called for an immediate end to military activity near the facility, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Reuters reported. Belarus has said that blasts heard overnight at one of its military bases 19 miles from Ukraine were caused by a “technical incident.” At least eight explosions were heard after midnight near Zyabrovka military airport, according to reports on Telegram messenger. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. Commenting on the incident, the Belarusian Defence Ministry said “the engine of a vehicle caught fire after replacement ... there were no casualties.” The incident occurred after powerful explosions rocked Russia’s Saki air base earlier this week in Russian-ruled Crimea, which Moscow had termed an accident. Ukraine has declined to publicly claim responsibility for the explosions at the base, while also not denying involvement. The British defence secretary has said Vladimir Putin is now unlikely to succeed in occupying Ukraine. Ben Wallace said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “faltered” and was “starting to fail”, as he pledged more financial and military support to the eastern European nation’s defence. Denmark joined the UK in offering more aid to Ukraine at a conference in Copenhagen on Thursday, co-hosted by Wallace. The defence secretary said it was important to understand that fighting and loss of life was still taking place, but added Russia was “starting to fail in many areas”. He said: They have failed so far and are unlikely to ever succeed in occupying Ukraine. Their invasion has faltered and constantly been re-modified to the extent they are really only focusing in parts of the south and in the east, a long, long way away from their three-day so-called special operation. Three days are now over 150 days and nearly six months in, with huge significant losses of both equipment and indeed Russian personnel. He added: President Putin will have gambled that come August, come a few months in, we will have all got bored of the conflict and the international community would have gone off in different directions. Well, today is proof of the opposite. We have come out of this meeting with more pledges of finance, more pledges of training and more pledges of military aid, all designed to help Ukraine win, to help Ukraine stand up for its sovereignty and indeed to ensure that president Putin’s ambitions fail in Ukraine as they rightly should. Ukraine expects $3bn of US financial aid to arrive in August and a further $1.5bn in September, its finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, said on Thursday. Marchenko said the payments were part of the $7.5bn financial aid package agreed by Ukraine and the US at the start of the summer and would be used to finance “critical spending” such as healthcare and pension costs. Here are some of the latest images sent over the newswires from Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company Energoatom has also claimed that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) has been attacked again, although, contrary to the claims reported in Russian media that Ukraine was to blame, it said that it has been shelled by pro-Russian forces. In a statement on Telegram it said: Today the Rashists once again bombarded the ZNPP, the largest in Ukraine and Europe. Five “arrivals” were recorded in the area of the commandant’s office of the station – right next to the welding area and the storage of radiation sources. Grass caught fire in a small area, but luckily no one was hurt. However, the enemy did not stop there. Five more “arrivals” occurred in the area of the fire department, which is located not far from the ZNPP … for the safety of nuclear workers, the buses with the personnel of the next shift were turned back to Energodar. Until the situation finally normalises, the workers of the previous shift will continue to work. The situation at the station is currently under control. The information, which was immediately spread in the hostile public, that the staff allegedly left the station in a panic, is fake and manipulative. The claims have not been independently verified. Russian news agency Tass is reporting that the occupying forces in Zaporizhzhia have told it that the armed forces of Ukraine fired at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the territory near the nuclear facility for the second time in a day. The claims have not been independently verified. The nuclear complex has been under Russian occupation since early March, although Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Sweden’s government has decided to extradite a man to Turkey wanted for fraud, it said, the first case since Turkey demanded a number of people be extradited in return for allowing Stockholm to formally apply for Nato membership. Turkey, a Nato member, lifted its veto over Finland and Sweden’s bid to join the alliance in June after weeks of tense negotiations where Ankara accused the two Nordic countries of harbouring what it says are militants of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). As part of the deal, Turkey submitted a list of people it wanted Sweden to extradite, but has since expressed frustration over the lack of progress. The man, in his 30s, would be the first known case of an extradition to Turkey since the deal was struck. “This is a normal, routine matter. The person in question is a Turkish citizen and convicted of fraud offences in Turkey in 2013 and 2016,” Morgan Johansson, Sweden’s justice minister, told Reuters in a text message. “The supreme court has examined the issue as usual and concluded that there are no obstacles to extradition,” he said. A spokesperson for the justice ministry declined to say whether the man was on the list of people Turkey demanded to have extradited, or to provide further comment on the matter. Russia has doubled the number of air strikes on Ukraine’s military positions and civilian infrastructure compared with the previous week, Ukrainian brigadier general Oleksiy Hromov said. “The enemy’s planes and helicopters avoid flying into the range of our air defences, and therefore the accuracy of these strikes is low,” he told a news conference, Reuters reported. UN secretary-general, António Guterres, called for an immediate end to military activity near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, Europe’s largest. “I am calling on the military forces of the Russian Federation and Ukraine to immediately cease all military activities in the immediate vicinity of the plant and not to target its facilities or surroundings,” he said in a statement on Thursday. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has told the UAE president, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, on a call that cooperation between the two countries on Ukraine and regional stability was “hugely important for the world”, Johnson’s spokesperson said. “The prime minister praised the crown prince’s success in bringing prosperity to both the UAE and the Gulf more generally,” the Downing Street spokesperson said on Thursday. “[Johnson] expressed his confidence that this cooperation will continue in the years ahead.” Britain and Denmark will provide more financial and military aid to Ukraine, they said on Thursday as European defence ministers met in Copenhagen to discuss long-term support for the country’s defence against Russia’s invasion. Britain, which has already donated advanced weapons systems to Ukraine and given thousands of its troops military training, said it would send more multiple-launch rocket systems, Reuters reported. It would also donate a “significant number” of precision-guided M31A1 missiles that can strike targets up to 80km (50 miles) away. “This latest tranche of military support will enable the armed forces of Ukraine to continue to defend against Russian aggression and the indiscriminate use of long-range artillery,” the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said in a statement. “Our continued support sends a very clear message: Britain and the international community remain opposed to this illegal war and will stand shoulder-to-shoulder, providing defensive military aid to Ukraine to help them defend against Putin’s invasion.” Denmark will increase its financial aid to Ukraine by 110m euros, said the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, at a conference in Copenhagen hosted by Ukraine, Denmark and Britain. She added: “This is a war on the values that Europe and the free world are built upon ... Today we reaffirm our commitment to support of Ukraine.” Russia has turned down a Swiss offer to represent Ukrainian interests in Russia and Moscow’s interests in Ukraine because it no longer considers Switzerland a neutral country. Switzerland has a long diplomatic tradition of acting as an intermediary between countries whose relations have broken down, but Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Ivan Nechayev said this was not possible in the current situation. “The Swiss were indeed interested in our opinion on the possible representation of Ukraine’s interests in Russia and Russia’s in Ukraine,” Nechayev told reporters. “We very clearly answered that Switzerland had unfortunately lost its status of a neutral state and could not act either as an intermediary or a representative. Bern has joined illegal western sanctions against Russia.” Neutral Switzerland has mirrored nearly all the sanctions that the EU imposed on Russia over its military intervention in Ukraine, Reuters reported. Ukraine has accused Russia of firing rockets from around the captured Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, killing at least 13 people and wounding 10, knowing it would be risky for Ukraine to return fire. Ukraine says Russia targeted the town of Marhanets, which Moscow says Ukraine has used in the past to shell Russian soldiers at the plant, which Russia seized in March. Calling on foreign allies to send more powerful weapons, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a late-night video address that Kyiv “will not leave today’s Russian shelling of the Dnipropetrovsk region unanswered”, and vowed to inflict as much damage on Russia as possible to end the war quickly. Russian-imposed authorities in Zaporizhzhia region have claimed that anti-aircraft defence systems thwarted Ukrainian attacks on the occupied city of Enerhodar and the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s air force said it believed up to a dozen Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground in Tuesday’s dramatic explosions at the Saky airbase in Crimea, which Russia said killed one person, wounded 13 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Political sources in Ukraine said the Ukrainian military had carried out the attack, but Kyiv did not publicly claim responsibility. One expert said it may have been the product of a daring raid rather than a missile strike. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said he thought the Saky airbase in Crimea was a “legitimate target” for Ukraine. “First and foremost, Russia has illegally invaded, not just in 2014, but now Ukrainian territory,” he said. “Ukraine, under UN articles, is perfectly entitled to defend its territory and take what action it needs to against an invading force.” Pro-Russian separatists accused Ukraine of shelling a brewery in the occupied eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, killing one person and triggering a leak of ammonia that sparked a fire, Reuters reported. Russia’s governor of Kursk, Roman Starovoyt, said that two settlements that border Ukraine were shelled. The Ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights has issued updated figures for child casualties since Russia began its latest invasion of Ukraine. The official figures are that 361 children have been killed and 705 children injured. As of 11 August, the commissioner says that 204 are considered missing, and that 6,159 have been deported. The EU has been urged to put a travel ban on Russian tourists, with some member states saying visiting Europe is “a privilege, not a human right” for holidaymakers. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told the Washington Post that the “most important sanction” is to “close the borders, because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. Latvia’s parliament, the Saeima, has named Russia as a terrorist-supporting state. In a statement, it said Russia had chosen a “cruel, immoral, and illegal tactic, using imprecise and internationally banned weapons and ammunition, targeting disproportionate brutality against civilians and public places” in Ukraine. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. Tom Ambrose will be here with you shortly. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has been at the Ukraine Donors’ Conference in Copenhagen with his Danish and British counterparts. Speaking this morning, he said: Russia’s words, and agreements with them, are not worth the paper they are written on. So what can be done? This solution is obvious. Russia succeeds when it manages to divide us, when it confronts us one-on-one, pulling together its resources and beating us. Russia is defeated and backs down when it loses the initiative, and meets with coordinated resistance. He went on to thank the Danish defence minister, Morten Bøedsko, and the British defence minister, Ben Wallace, for their continued support, and also singled out for praise Lloyd Austin, the US secretary of defence. The meeting was addressed via video link by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Here is a selection of some of the latest images sent to us from Ukraine over the newswires. Latvia’s parliament, the Saeima, has named Russia as a terrorist-supporting state. In a statement, the Saeima called on the EU to prevent tourism from Russia. It said: Russia has been providing support and financing for terrorist regimes and organisations for many years, directly and indirectly, as the largest arms supplier for the Assad regime in Syria and as an implementer, such as the poisoning of the Skripal family or the shooting of the MH-17 aircraft. In Ukraine, Russia has chosen a similar, cruel, immoral, and illegal tactic, using imprecise and internationally banned weapons and ammunition, targeting disproportionate brutality against civilians and public places. Latvia’s public broadcaster reports: In its statement, the Saeima stresses that Russia uses suffering and intimidation as an instrument in its attempts to demoralise the Ukrainian people and armed forces. The Saeima acknowledges Russia’s violence against civilians, which is being pursued for political purposes, as terrorism and Russia as a country supporting terrorism, and calls on other similar-thinking countries to express such an opinion. The Ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights has issued updated figures for child casualties since Russia began its latest invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. The official figures are that 361 children have been killed and 705 children injured. As of 11 August, the commissioner says that 204 are considered missing, and that 6,159 have been deported. Reuters reports that the Russian-imposed authorities in Zaporizhzhia region have claimed to Russian news agencies Tass and RIA that anti-aircraft defence systems thwarted Ukrainian attacks on the occupied city of Enerhodar and the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The claims have not been independently verified. The source of attacks on and near to the Russian-occupied nuclear power plant has been hotly disputed. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has been exploiting the explosions at the Russian air base in Crimea for social media propaganda purposes. It has issued a video with the message: “Unless they want an unpleasantly hot summer break, we advise our valued Russian guests not to visit Ukrainian Crimea. Because no amount of sunscreen will protect them from the hazardous effects of smoking in unauthorised areas.” The video, to the soundtrack of Bananarama’s Cruel Summer, lists a host of summer holiday venues that Russian tourists in Crimea could have chosen instead, alongside inviting footage of those destinations, then says that they made a big mistake by choosing to holiday in Ukraine. It then cuts together social media footage of the explosions along with clips of tourists fleeing beaches and crying in the aftermath of the incident. The reference to “smoking in unauthorised areas” is to the suggestion from Russian authorities that the explosions, which appear to have destroyed multiple planes that were on the ground at the time, were caused by an accidental fire at the base. Back to that series of explosions at a Russian air base on Tuesday for a moment, the Guardian has been carrying some analysis by Justin Bronk: Justin Bronk, an aviation analyst with the Rusi thinktank, said that, having studied social media videos of the incident, he could see no evidence of incoming missiles and that he was “almost certain” there were “secondary explosions” of ammunition stores or fuel bunkers which were stored on or near the airstrip. That led him to conclude that “the most likely current theory for me is that Ukrainian special forces carried out the attack by infiltrating close enough to the base to launch and guide in small UAVs [drones] or loitering munitions, to hit either parked aircraft or fuel trucks/storage”. Read more here in our updated report from Samantha Lock and from Dan Sabbagh in Kyiv: Russian warplanes destroyed in Crimea airbase attack, satellite images show Russia’s governor of Kursk, Roman Starovoyt, has claimed on Telegram that two Russian settlements close to the border with Ukraine are under fire this morning. He named Tetkino and Popovo-Lezhachi as the targets. His message promised more details later. Russian media this morning are carrying claims from the self-proclaimed breakaway republics in Ukraine’s east. Tass has quotes from Denis Pushilin, the self-styled leader of the chiefly unrecognised Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). Pushilin again is pushing his line that the deaths of prisoners of war at the Russian-controlled Olenivka prison were the responsibility of Kyiv. He told the media: The motive here is clear. The first is to shut up, not to give them the opportunity to speak, to confess to those crimes. Because not only are they the perpetrators of war crimes, they are also witnesses. Because these teams gave them specific names, surnames, positions and directly, according to our data, Zelensky himself often personally intervened here. Tass goes on to quote him saying that the attack happened after confessions of Ukrainian soldiers began to be made public. “After these video confessions began to appear, this blow was dealt directly,” he said. There have been calls for a UN-backed independent investigation into the incident, which led to the deaths of at least 51 people died while more than 100 were injured. Both sides of the war have claimed the other is responsible. Ukraine claims pro-Russian forces blew up the prison building to conceal evidence of the torture and deaths of the POWs being held there. The RIA Novosti agency, meanwhile, is carrying a claim from the authorities of the similarly self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR). In its report it says that the armed forces of the LPR have told it that they have found the bodies of foreign mercenaries that have been burnt by Ukrainian troops as they retreated in order to conceal the identity of the dead. The incident is reported to have happened at Soledar, which is inside the territory claimed by the DPR. The report offered no evidence and the claims have not been independently verified. The DPR and the LPR are only recognised as legitimate authorities by three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. The British ministry of defence has issued its daily intelligence briefing about the war in Ukraine, which today has focused on the impact of the war on Russia’s military exports. In part of the report, the ministry says Russia’s “military industrial capacity is now under significant strain, and the credibility of many of its weapon systems has been undermined by their association with Russian forces’ poor performance in the Ukraine war.” Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has posted to Telegram to say that his western region of Ukraine had a peaceful night with no attacks or air alarms. He said that 155 people arrived in the region on evacuation trains from the east yesterday. This is Martin Belam on the live blog in London. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Before I hand you over to my colleague, Martin Belam, here is a quick update of developments so far this morning. Russian warplanes appear to have been damaged or destroyed in the recent attack on Saky airbase in Crimea, according to newly released satellite images. The images, from the US-based Planet Labs, show large areas of scorched earth and damage to the runway alongside the charred remnants of military aircraft. Russia has claimed control of Pisky in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. An official with the Russia-backed Donetsk People’s Republic said Pisky, on the frontlines just 10km (6 miles) northwest of provincial capital Donetsk, was under control of Russian and separatist forces. “It’s hot in Pisky. The town is ours,” the official, Danil Bezsonov, said on Telegram. Ukrainian officials denied that the heavily fortified town, a key to the defence of Donetsk, had fallen. Reports of explosions sounding near the Belarus border with Ukraine were described on Wednesday evening. Franak Viacorka, senior advisor to Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the national leader of Belarus and opposition leader to president Alexander Lukashenko, said he heard “at least eight explosions” around 1am in the Homiel region near the border with Ukraine. Pro-Russian separatists accused Ukraine of shelling a Donetsk brewery, killing one person and triggering a leak of ammonia. The emergencies ministry in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic said a shell had hit an ammonia line late at night, sparking a fire that at one point covered 600 square metres (6,500 square feet). The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting later today to address the crisis at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The meeting is scheduled to occur on 11 August at 3pm (7pm GMT) according to a statement issued by the UN nuclear safety watchdog. The first grain ship to leave Ukraine under a UN-backed deal last week docked in Turkey on Wednesday, marine traffic sites showed, following a report that it has finally found a buyer for its maize. Marine traffic sites showed the Razoni docked in Turkey’s Mediterranean Sea port of Mersin after spending several days anchored just off the coast. The first wartime wheat from Ukraine should ship next week after an agreement signed by Russia and Ukraine last month lifted a Russian blockade of Ukraine’s ports and established safe corridors, a top UN official has said. The first 12 ships to leave the three Black Sea ports designated by the agreement were carrying 370,000 tonnes of corn and foodstuffs, according to Frederick Kenney, interim UN coordinator at the joint centre in Istanbul overseeing the deal. The UN expects to see a “big uptick” in applications for ships to export Ukrainian grain after transit procedures were agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations, a senior UN official said on Wednesday. The number of inbound vessels is expected to “grow in the near future” as grain deals are made, Kenney said. So far, 24 grain carrying ships have left Ukrainian ports. Heavy fighting raged around the eastern Ukrainian town of Pisky on Thursday as Russia pressed its campaign to seize all of the industrialised Donbas region. An official with the Russia-backed Donetsk People’s Republic said Pisky, on the frontlines just 10km (6 miles) northwest of provincial capital Donetsk, was under control of Russian and separatist forces. “It’s hot in Pisky. The town is ours but there remain scattered pockets of resistance in its north and west,” the official, Danil Bezsonov, said on Telegram, according to a report from Reuters news agency. Ukrainian officials denied that the heavily fortified town, a key to the defence of Donetsk, had fallen. The Guardian has been unable to immediately verify the battlefield accounts. Oleksiy Arestovych, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, said in an interview posted on YouTube that Russian “movement into Pisky” had been “without success”. Luhansk regional Governor Serhiy Gaidai, interviewed on Ukrainian TV, said Russia had sent increasing numbers of mercenaries into the region, including from the Wagner private security firm. “We once had peaceful Ukrainian towns. Now we have been thrust into the Middle Ages ... People are now leaving because they are afraid of freezing in the coming winter,” he said. Reports of explosions sounding near the Belarus border with Ukraine were described on Wednesday evening. Franak Viacorka, senior advisor to Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the national leader of Belarus and opposition leader to president Alexander Lukashenko, said he heard “at least eight explosions” around 1am in the Homiel region near the border with Ukraine. “At least eight explosions in the Homiel region near the border with Ukraine. According to witnesses, explosions took place near Ziabrauka airfield. Russian military aircraft are often stationed there,” he said in a tweet. According to the Belarus defence ministry, military drills were set to be conducted during the time the explosions were heard. However, there has been no confirmation whether the explosions were connected to the drills. The Ziabrauka airfield has been used by Russia’s armed forces in the war against Ukraine. The armed forces of Ukraine also said it had received information that explosions could be heard and flares can be seen in the vicinity of the Ziabrauka airfield in an update posted to Telegram late on Wednesday. Earlier, the Belarus ministry of defence announced the conduct of live-fire exercises of the air force. Pro-Russian separatists accused Ukraine of shelling a brewery in the occupied eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, killing one person and triggering a leak of ammonia, Interfax news agency said. The emergencies ministry in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic said a shell had hit an ammonia line late at night, sparking a fire that at one point covered 600 square metres (6,500 square feet). Reuters pictures from the scene showed flames lighting the sky above one part of the city as well as firefighters donning masks. One picture appeared to show a corpse on the ground. Russian state media agency RT said the “toxic gas is affecting a 2km radius round the factory” citing local DPR officials. Residents have been urged to stay inside and not open their windows. The Ukrainian defence ministry has not made any comment. On the topic of Ukrainian grain exports, the centre coordinating its shipment to world markets expects “a big uptick” in applications to pick up cargoes at Ukrainian ports in the near future, its interim coordinator said. Frederick Kenney told a virtual news conference from Istanbul, where the Joint Coordination Centre is located, that ship owners have shown “tremendous interest” in exporting grain from Ukraine under a recently signed new deal. The centre is receiving “literally dozens and dozens of phone calls every day and emails asking when can we get ready to go,” said Kenney, director of legal and external affairs at the international maritime organisation who is leading the UN’s efforts at the centre to get grain shipped from three Ukrainian ports. He said detailed procedures on shipping and inspections were sent out to the industry on Monday and their dissemination “is also going to drive a surge in requests, but it is early days.” We’re expecting to see a big uptick in applications for transit,” Kenney said. “Indeed, we’re aware that there are a number of empty grain vessels sitting at anchorage in Turkish anchorage areas waiting to arrange the contracts. And once they have their deals arranged they’ll be transiting northbound.” Asked about relations among the parties, since Russia and Ukraine are at war, he said, “I’ve been extremely impressed with the level of cooperation and coordination that has been displayed.” The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting later today to address the crisis at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, diplomatic sources told Agence France-Presse. The meeting is scheduled to occur on 11 August at 3pm (7pm GMT) according to a statement issued by the UN nuclear safety watchdog. A diplomatic source at UN headquarters in New York told Agence France-Presse that the council’s 15 member nations would gather at the request of Russia, one of the five permanent members of the Security Council - along with Britain, China, France and the United States - which hold veto power over UN resolutions. At least 14 people were killed after shelling in southeastern Ukraine near the Zaporizhzhia power plant, the largest in Europe. The G7 group of most industrialised nations warned that Moscow’s continued occupation of the plant “endangers the region,” and called for return of the facility to Ukrainian control. The UN nuclear safety watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said in a statement that its director general Rafael Grossi would brief the Security Council meeting “about the nuclear safety and security situation” at the plant as well as his “efforts to agree and lead an IAEA expert mission to the site as soon as possible”. “I welcome this opportunity to inform the Council. It is vital that the IAEA be present at the plant to help reduce danger of a possible nuclear disaster,” Grossi said. I welcome this opportunity to inform the United Nations Security Council about the extremely serious situation facing one of the world’s biggest nuclear power plants, now located in the middle of an active war zone. An accident at this plant could threaten public health and the environment both in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, as well as further away. It is vital that the IAEA be present at the plant to help reduce danger of a possible nuclear disaster.” Grossi called the situation at the complex “extremely serious”. The first grain ship to leave Ukraine under a UN-backed deal last week docked in Turkey on Wednesday, marine traffic sites showed, following a report that it has finally found a buyer for its maize. The Sierra Leone-flagged vessel Razoni left the Ukrainian port of Odesa on 1 August carrying 26,000 tonnes of corn and had been expected to dock in the Lebanese port of Tripoli last weekend. But Ukrainian officials said the shipment’s five-month delay caused by Russia’s invasion prompted the Lebanese buyer to cancel the deal once the ship was already at sea. Marine traffic sites showed the Razoni docked in Turkey’s Mediterranean Sea port of Mersin after spending several days anchored just off the coast. The Middle East Eye news site cites a shipping agent as saying that a Turkish buyer has been found for the maize. The “cargo sold.... It will [unload] at Mersin,” Ahmed al-Fares of the Ashram Maritime Agency told the news site. The first wartime wheat from Ukraine should ship next week after agreement signed by Russia and Ukraine last month lifted a Russian blockade of Ukraine’s ports and established safe corridors, a top UN official has said. The first 12 ships to leave the three Black Sea ports designated by the agreement were carrying 370,000 tonnes of corn and foodstuffs, according to Frederick Kenney, interim UN coordinator at the joint centre in Istanbul overseeing the deal. But that should change once the ships docked in Ukraine leave their ports and new ones come in to pick up wheat that has accumulated with this year’s harvest, Kenney told reporters. We are dealing with three ports that were essentially frozen in time. The silos were full of corn and the ships that were there have been loaded with corn. It’s imperative to get those ships out to get new ships in .... that can deal with the food crisis.” Kenney added that the shipments would be transitioning to wheat. We have cleared the first ship inbound” to Ukraine through the Bosphorus Strait, he said. “That should occur some time next week.” We’re seeing steady progress in the number of ships coming in and out. We’re off to a good start.” At least eight Russian warplanes appear to have been damaged or destroyed in the recent attack on Saky airbase in Crimea, according to newly released satellite images. The images, from the US-based Planet Labs, show large areas of scorched earth and damage to the runway alongside the charred remnants of military aircraft. Images taken by the private satellite operator at around 8am on 9 August – approximately four hours before the attack – and about 4.40pm on 10 August, show at least eight aircraft parked outside were damaged or destroyed. The before-and-after images are the first independent confirmation of damage to the base, prompting questions about how a location more than 100 miles (160km) from the frontline could have been attacked. Eliot Higgins, founder and director of open source investigative website Bellingcat, said he “can’t think of a time Russia has lost this many air assets in one day in recent memory” in a series of tweets on Thursday. Ukraine says nine Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground following Tuesday’s dramatic explosions at the Saky airbase in Crimea, which Russia said killed one, wounded 13 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Political sources in Ukraine said the country had carried out the attack – but no public claim of responsibility was made by Kyiv. Yuriy Ignat, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force, told national television that from studying video footage of the incident, it was clear “the aircraft weapons depot was hit”. He said: “And if additionally a dozen planes are destroyed there, it will be a real small victory.” The country’s air force also said on its Facebook page that “nine invader planes” had been destroyed in a short posting, although it did not specify in that message where or how it believed they had been eliminated. Ukraine’s president, Volodoymyr Zelenskiy, referred to the attack in his latest national address on Wednesday evening. In just one day, the occupiers lost 10 combat aircraft: nine in Crimea and one more in the direction of Zaporizhzhia. The occupiers also suffer new losses of armoured vehicles, warehouses with ammunition, logistics routes.” The claims could not be verified but the Saky airbase is home to Su-30M fighters, Su-24 bombers and the Il-76 transporter, used regularly to launch missile strikes into Ukraine and patrol the Black Sea and surrounding area. Ukraine’s public coyness about the attack is partly designed to preserve some ambiguity about the means used, sources said, prompting broad speculation as to how Kyiv was able to strike so deep behind Russian lines, in one of the first attacks on Crimean soil since the Russian invasion began in February. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while until my colleague, Martin Belam, takes the reins. At least eight Russian warplanes appear to have been damaged or destroyed in the recent attack on Saky airbase in Crimea, according to newly released satellite images. The first wartime wheat from Ukraine should ship next week after agreement signed by Russia and Ukraine last month lifted a Russian blockade of Ukraine’s ports and established safe corridors, a top UN official has said. The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting later today to address the crisis at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, diplomatic sources told Agence France-Presse. It is 7.30am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Ukraine has accused Russia of firing rockets from around the captured Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, killing at least 13 people and wounding 10, knowing it would be risky for Ukraine to return fire. Ukraine says Russia targeted the town of Marhanets, which Moscow says Ukraine has used in the past to shell Russian soldiers at the plant, which Russia seized in March. Calling on foreign allies to send more powerful weapons, Zelenskiy said in a late-night video address that Kyiv “will not leave today’s Russian shelling of the Dnipropetrovsk region unanswered”, and vowed to inflict as much damage on Russia as possible to end the war quickly. Ukraine’s air force said it believed up to a dozen Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground in Tuesday’s dramatic explosions at the Saky airbase in Crimea, which Russia said killed one, wounded 13 and damaged dozens of nearby houses. Political sources in Ukraine said it had carried out the attack, but Kyiv did not publicly claim responsibility. One expert said it may have been the product of a daring raid rather than a missile strike. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said he thought the Saky airbase in Crimea was a “legitimate target” for Ukraine. “First and foremost, Russia has illegally invaded, not just in 2014, but now Ukrainian territory,” he said. “Ukraine, under UN articles, is perfectly entitled to defend its territory and take what action it needs to against an invading force.” Pro-Russian separatists accused Ukraine of shelling a brewery in the occupied eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, killing one person and triggering a leak of ammonia that sparked a fire. The EU has been urged to put a travel ban on Russian tourists, with some member states saying visiting Europe is “a privilege, not a human right” for holidaymakers. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told the Washington Post that the “most important sanction” is to “close the borders, because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. China, which Russia has sought as an ally since being cold-shouldered by the west, has called the US the “main instigator” of the crisis, Reuters reported. In an interview with the Russian state news agency Tass published on Wednesday, China’s ambassador to Moscow, Zhang Hanhui, accused Washington of backing Russia into a corner with repeated expansion of the Nato defence alliance. The UN expects to see a “big uptick” in applications for ships to export Ukrainian grain after transit procedures were agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations, a senior UN official said on Wednesday. The number of inbound vessels is expected to “grow in the near future” as grain deals are made, said Frederick Kenney, interim UN coordinator in Istanbul. So far, 24 grain carrying ships have left Ukrainian ports. Estonia said it had summoned the Russian ambassador and formally protested about the violation of its airspace by a Russian helicopter on Tuesday. “Estonia considers this an extremely serious and regrettable incident that is completely unacceptable,” the ministry announced, saying the helicopter had flown over Estonia’s south-east without permission. Ukraine’s overseas creditors have backed its request for a two-year freeze on payments on almost $20bn in international bonds, allowing it to avoid a debt default, Reuters reported. Ukraine’s prime minister says it will save the country almost $6bn, while helping to stabilise its economy and strengthen its army."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jan/17/ukraine-world-economic-forum-davos-first-day","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-17T15:41:51Z","webTitle":"Ukraine urges world leaders to intensify war efforts on first day at Davos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/17/ukraine-world-economic-forum-davos-first-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jan/17/ukraine-world-economic-forum-davos-first-day","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine urges world leaders to intensify war efforts on first day at Davos","bodyText":"Ukraine has urged world leaders to intensify efforts to remove Vladimir Putin’s troops from its soil as the country’s war with Russia dominated the first full day of the gathering of the global elite in Davos. With the war clouding the outlook for the global economy in 2023, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Yuliia Svyrydenko, urged the country’s allies to step up supplies of military hardware so that Russia could be more quickly defeated. Asked what was next for Ukraine, Svyrydenko said: “What’s next is success. Russia won’t achieve its goal and we will definitely win this war.” Meanwhile, Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, used a special address to demand that those attending the World Economic Forum use their influence to end Russia’s aggression. Zelenska told delegates in Davos that some were failing to use their influence, or sometimes using it in a way “that divides even more”. “What can life be in a world where tanks are allowed to strike at nuclear power stations? What will happen to inflation when state borders start to collapse, and the integrity of countries is trampled?” she asked. “This war can go further, and make crises wider, if the aggressor does not lose,” Zelenska added. She brought three letters from her husband, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to hand to Alain Berset, the president of the Swiss Confederation, to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and for China’s Xi Jinping, which has been handed to the vice-premier, Liu He, who is attending Davos. The note says that “if people come together, they can move mountains”, Zelenska revealed. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered an energy crisis on an unprecedented scale. “Our world has never ever seen an energy crisis of this depth and of this complexity,” he said. “At the same time it gave a big boost to clean energy development. In the past clean energy was renewables, electric cars, efficiency, heat pumps, they were growing, but the main driver was environmental reasons. The biggest driver [of renewables] today is energy security – homegrown is the energy of peace.” Beata Javorcik, the chief economist of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), said the focus had changed since the last Davos meeting in May. “In May, we were talking about reconstruction [of Ukraine]. The focus now is getting through the winter, what’s happening in the here and now”. Javorcik said international bodies such as the EBRD were concentrating on emergency budget support and emergency repairs. “We are helping to keep the lights on, the heat on and the trains running”, she said. At least 7 million Ukrainians have fled abroad since the war started last February and Javorcik said the EBRD was eager to avoid another wave of refugees by providing help over the coming months. “Human capital is as important as physical capital,” she said. Von der Leyen said the EU would not desert Ukraine. “We are in it for as long as it takes, and stand by our Ukrainian friends”, she said. North Macedonia’s president, Stevo Pendarovski, said he feared that the western Balkans were a soft spot in Europe’s security architecture. Pendarovski told a Davos event that Putin’s regime had, for years, tried to provoke the people in the region, through fake news and propaganda. He predicted that Russia could try to deflect the west’s attention from Ukraine, and that the western Balkan region was more prone to that risk than the Baltic countries. “It seems to me that the so-called soft spot in the whole pan-European security architecture right now, apart from Ukraine of course, from that danger from the Kremlin is the western Balkans,” Pendarovski said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-insulation-fuel-duty-uk-net-zero-carbon-goals","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T18:11:38Z","webTitle":"Budget does little to meet UK’s net zero carbon goals, say campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-insulation-fuel-duty-uk-net-zero-carbon-goals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-insulation-fuel-duty-uk-net-zero-carbon-goals","fields":{"headline":"Budget does little to meet UK’s net zero carbon goals, say campaigners","bodyText":"The government’s latest budget will do little to meet the UK’s net zero carbon goals, missed opportunities to create a green economy, and would saddle households with high energy bills driven by fossil fuel prices, green campaigners and experts have said. Jeremy Hunt, chancellor of the exchequer, was a self-styled “green Tory” as a backbencher, and in his speech gave a nod towards the UK’s green ambitions with a boost for nuclear power and for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. But missing from the budget was any hint of the hoped-for focus on home insulation, any strengthening of the windfall tax on record oil and gas profits, or removal of the barriers to onshore windfarms. Instead, the continuing freeze on fuel duty will benefit drivers of fuel-guzzling SUVs, and would leave the UK on the starting blocks while other countries – including the US, the EU and China – are racing ahead in creating green jobs, analysts said. Luke Murphy, associate director for energy and climate at the IPPR thinktank, said: “There is a global race to the top in reaching net zero, and the UK now risks falling seriously behind our competitors. The government needs to learn the lessons from the US and Europe, ramp up public investment, and bring forward a green industrial strategy, safeguarding our economy and environment for the future.” Hunt repeated his mantra of four Es for the UK’s future investment – enterprise, education, employment and everywhere. Josh Burke, senior policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute, part of the London School of Economics, said: “This budget has failed to deliver a long-term, economy-wide investment plan to accelerate the transition to sustainable and resilient growth. The two Es missing from the industrial strategy are the environment and energy.” Ami McCarthy, political campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said the focus on small nuclear plants, called small modular reactors, and CCS, both early-stage technologies, missed out far more realistic opportunities to pursue low-carbon power. “This misguided budget shows the stranglehold fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies have on this government. Why else would it take such a dangerous gamble on unproven technologies?” she asked. “Squandering taxpayers’ money on nuclear reactors that don’t even exist yet and fanciful carbon capture is irresponsible, and does nothing to reduce our emissions now.” Hunt announced no new spending on home insulation, and did not bring forward spending on energy efficiency allocated for 2025, despite clear research showing that insulation can keep people’s homes warmer amid high energy bills, and calls from the government’s own statutory climate adviser, the Climate Change Committee, to prioritise insulation. Ross Matthewman, head of policy and campaigns at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, said: “We are disappointed that the chancellor appears to be taking his foot off the pedal. By failing to bring forward planned spending on energy efficiency measures, he has missed a golden opportunity to both reduce energy bills and decarbonise the housing sector.” Transport policy was another missed opportunity, added Alfie Stirling, director of research and chief economist at the New Economics Foundation. Drivers of larger cars are the biggest winners from the continuing freeze on fuel duty, while people on lower incomes are more likely to use lower-carbon public transport. “The government is continuing to subsidise polluting travel and disproportionately benefiting higher earners, with the 13th freeze on fuel duty in a row,” said Stirling. After the budget announcement, the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, told MPs he was “busting a gut” to get solar power on rooftops, including those of large buildings such as warehouses. He told the environmental audit committee he was working to remove the requirement for planning permission for solar installations above 1MW, which was inhibiting installations on the roofs of commercial buildings. But he indicated he would not mandate solar power on the rooftops of new houses, as some MPs urged him to do. He said the government would require, in its forthcoming future homes standard, that new homes must produce 75% less carbon dioxide than homes built in 2013, but that ministers would leave up to housebuilders how this was achieved, because mandating particular technologies would “reduce innovation”, he claimed. “There is more than one way to skin a cat,” he told MPs. “The hesitation is over saying ‘this is the only thing you can put in’.” Shapps also promised a far greater green push to come, after the budget. The government is obliged by a high court ruling last year to publish by the end of this month clear plans on how to reach the net zero target. A response to the review of the net zero target by Chris Skidmore, published early this year, will come out at the same time. The announcement, due in a fortnight, will contain plans to boost hydrogen, wind power, solar energy and heat pumps, according to Shapps. “There will be much more I can say then,” he told MPs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/09/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-167-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-09T10:07:18Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 167 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/09/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-167-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/09/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-167-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 167 of the invasion","bodyText":"Russia has suspended an arrangement that allowed US and Russian inspectors to visit each other’s nuclear weapons sites under the 2010 New Start treaty, in a fresh blow to arms control. Mutual inspections had been suspended as a health precaution since the start of the Covid pandemic, but a foreign ministry statement on Monday added another reason Russia is unwilling to restart them. It argued that US sanctions imposed because of the invasion of Ukraine stopped Russian inspectors travelling to the US. Ukraine has reported intense Russian shelling across the frontlines on Tuesday as both sides traded blame for the weekend strike on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex that triggered international concern about a potential atomic disaster. Heavy fighting was reported in frontline towns near the eastern city of Donetsk, where Ukrainian officials said Russian troops were launching waves of attacks. In an interview the self-appointed leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin, said the advance of pro-Russian forces in the Donbas is developing in a northern direction, with fighting going on on the outskirts of Bakhmut and Soledar. He said that the DPR was in negotiations with Pyongyang to bring builders from North Korea in to help rebuild the occupied territory. Pushilin also stated that there would be an “open tribunal over the war criminals of Ukraine”, with the first to be held in Mariupol, which would feature the testimony of the “Azovites”, in reference to Ukraine’s Azov battalion. Russia’s assault towards the town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine has been its most successful axis in the Donbas region in the past month, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Despite this, it had only gained 10km in that time, while elsewhere in Donbas it had gained only 3km over 30 days – “almost certainly significantly less than planned”. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-imposed military-civilian administration in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine has said “Kherson region is ready to repel the attempts of the offensive by Ukrainian militants, if such a criminal order is given. Reliable protection of the borders of the region is provided by the Russian ministry of defence.” Two further grain-carrying ships have sailed from Ukraine’s Chornomorsk port on Tuesday, as part of the deal to unblock Ukrainian sea exports. The Ocean Lion, which departed for South Korea, is carrying 64,720 tonnes of corn, it said, while the Rahmi Yağcı is carrying 5,300 tonnes of sunflower meal to Istanbul. Four ships that left Ukraine earlier are anchored near Istanbul and will be inspected on Tuesday, the Turkish defence ministry said. Belarus, where Russian troops were positioned to hold joint exercises before they invaded Ukraine from the north in February, has announced it is to hold live fire military training exercises both in Belarus and in Russia during August. Russia launched an Iranian satellite into orbit on Tuesday on morning, but Tehran has sought to deflect suspicions that Moscow could use Khayyam to improve its surveillance of military targets in Ukraine. The US believes Russia has suffered between 70,000 and 80,000 casualties, either killed or wounded, since its latest invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. Colin Kahl, the Pentagon’s top policy official said: “The Russians are taking a tremendous number of casualties on the other side of the equation. I think it’s safe to suggest that the Russians are probably taking 70 or 80,000 casualties in less than six months.” Ukraine has arrested two people working for Russian intelligence services who planned to kill the Ukrainian defence minister and the head of the country’s military intelligence agency, Ukraine’s domestic Security Service said on Monday. The Security Service of Ukraine foiled the plot by the Russian GRU military intelligence agency to use a sabotage group to carry out three murders including that of a prominent Ukrainian activist, the agency said. The United States will provide an additional $4.5bn (£3.7bn) to Ukraine’s government, bringing its total budgetary support since Russia’s February invasion to $8.5bn (£7bn), the US Agency for International Development has announced. The funding, coordinated with the US Treasury Department through the World Bank, will go to Ukraine’s government in tranches, beginning with a $3bn (£2.5bn) disbursement in August, USAid, the Agency for International Development, said. It is highly likely Russia is deploying anti-personnel mines to protect and deter freedom of movement along its defensive lines in Donetsk and Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. The ministry called the PFM-1 and PFM-1S mines – also known as “butterfly mines” – “deeply controversial and indiscriminate weapons” with the potential to inflict widespread casualties among both the military and the local civilian population. The first grain carrying ship to depart Ukrainian ports after the UN-brokered deal is looking for another port to unload its cargo after the initial Lebanese buyer refused delivery due to its five-month delay, Reuters reported. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom has called for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to be made a military-free zone, warning of the risk of a Chornobyl-style nuclear disaster after shelling of the site caused a reactor to shut down on Saturday. Russia and Ukraine continue to trade accusations over is responsible for the shelling, with the UN calling for international inspectors to be given access. According to reports from the head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region, the nuclear power station is currently operating normally. The Russian-installed head of the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region signed a decree on Monday providing for a referendum on joining Russia, in the latest sign that Moscow is moving ahead with its plans to annex seized Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has ruled out any peace talks with Russia if the country proceeds with referendums in the occupied areas. The Kremlin said on Monday there was no basis for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents at the moment. Negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv have been stalled for months, with each side blaming the other for a lack of progress, Reuters reports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/20/energy-bills-drax-carbon-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-20T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Energy bills may rise if government gives Drax more support, say MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/20/energy-bills-drax-carbon-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/20/energy-bills-drax-carbon-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Energy bills may rise if government gives Drax more support, say MPs","bodyText":"MPs have warned consumers may end up paying higher bills if the government rushes into providing further state support for power station owner Drax. As part of Liz Truss’s £150bn energy bills freeze, renewable and nuclear power generators are being asked to supply electricity below current market rates. Officials have begun to “negotiate” with generators on older wind, solar and nuclear contracts, which have benefited from windfall gains as the price of gas has soared, to persuade them to switch to newer, less lucrative deals, which lock in lower prices in return for guaranteed long-term income. It is understood Drax, which owns the vast power station complex in North Yorkshire and is Britain’s single biggest source of carbon emissions, could also negotiate over units 2 and 3 at its plant, which receive renewable obligation certificate (ROC) payments for burning biomass wood pellets, making them eligible for the scheme. Generators are not obliged to negotiate with the government as the scheme is voluntary. Drax has not yet confirmed whether it plans to rework its contract. It said it is “working in partnership with the government to find ways in which we can support the country during the energy crisis this winter”. However, there are growing fears that the government is in a weak negotiating position as generators will need to be convinced to forgo high prices that are unlikely to abate for some time, meaning officials could rush into deals that later prove a poor deal for taxpayers if the spike in wholesale gas prices quickly subsides. The thinktank Ember calculates that, from 2012 until 2027, when Drax’s ROC subsidies end, it will have collected more than £11bn in government payouts. It is understood the new contracts could stretch to between 10 and 15 years, opening up the possibility that Drax could land a further decade of state support. The company has drawn criticism from scientists and campaigners who have argued that burning wood to produce electricity is far from green and can even increase the CO2 emissions driving the climate crisis. Nuclear power station owners Centrica and EDF are keen to enter the initiative and have already begun talks with ministers. The initiative was formally unveiled hours before parliament was suspended due to Queen’s mourning period. Charlotte Nichols, the Labour MP and member of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said: “It is vital that the terms of these renegotiated contracts receive proper parliamentary scrutiny, as it risks locking in higher prices over the longer term and continuing excessive subsidies for technologies we are moving away from as we head towards our net zero targets. “Such long-term financial decisions cannot simply be made unilaterally as a kneejerk response to our current energy crisis, and must be properly debated, with alternatives considered, before any decisions are made that cannot later be unpicked. Particular scrutiny needs to be given to any deal with Drax given the existing levels of government support.” The Conservative MP Pauline Latham said: “The government is right to be looking at ways to bring down energy bills. But they should avoid locking bill payers into expensive new 15-year contracts to subsidise sources of energy with dubious environmental credentials. Instead, we should focus on building new renewables which are nine times cheaper than gas.” The Friends of the Earth head of policy, Mike Childs, said: “During a cost of living crisis and with wind and solar power so cheap, it’s astonishing that the government is considering spending more public money on Drax. “If the company is to receive more subsidies, the government must at the very least ensure full transparency and proper parliamentary scrutiny.” Truss and the chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, have opposed windfall taxes, however the EU’s decision to impose an emergency levy may increase pressure on Truss to follow suit. The Times reported that some power generators believe a windfall tax would be better than being pushed to sign cut-price contracts. Drax said in July that profit before tax had jumped to £200m in the first half of the year, up from £52m in the same period a year earlier, aided by high electricity prices. It upgraded annual profit forecasts, and has signed a deal with National Grid to keep its coal-fired operations open through the winter. In the past 12 months, its stock has risen 63% to 709p, valuing the company at £2.84bn, after peaking at 831p in April. Kwarteng said last month, when he was business and energy secretary, that the importing of wood to burn in Drax power station “is not sustainable” and “doesn’t make any sense”. A Drax spokesperson said: “Drax is working in partnership with the government to find ways in which we can support the country during the energy crisis this winter. “We also plan to invest £3bn by 2030 in critical renewable energy infrastructure projects, including bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and pumped hydro storage, which will support energy security as well as jobs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/commentisfree/2022/aug/02/peter-dutton-has-reached-into-the-weeds-of-the-climate-wars-and-pulled-out-nuclear-energy-its-beyond-ludicrous","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T11:31:57Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton has reached into the weeds of the climate wars and pulled out nuclear energy.

It’s beyond ludicrous","bodyText":"I understand patience is a virtue, but it’s not an inexhaustible commodity – particularly when a party of government continues to have a lend of the Australian public in such extravagant fashion over such a long period of time. Peter Dutton has made his captain’s call to oppose Labor’s 43% emissions reduction target for two reasons: to force Anthony Albanese to do a parliamentary deal with the Greens, a situation he senses is risky for Labor politically; and to reserve the right to engage in more weaponised bollocks by blaming rising consumer prices on Labor’s new 2030 target. Dutton’s big partisan play was formalised on Monday night by the shadow cabinet with only a minimum of pushback. Then it was rubber stamped by the Coalition party room on Tuesday morning with only the minimum of pushback. What’s happening now is dead simple: later this week in the House of Representatives, the Liberal and National parties will once again vote against any form of serious emissions reduction. That’s the truth. Voting against action to combat the climate crisis. This behaviour needs to be called for what it is. But Dutton obviously needed something to say on Tuesday apart from, I am an absolute shocker who is leading a political party that can’t seem to face up to the responsibility of leadership grounded in evidence, reason, and prudent risk management, so he sailed forth with news. There would be a review into nuclear energy. If you haven’t been at this deranged rodeo for as long as I have, you may not know nuclear power has practical utility for the Liberal party. Colleagues invoked the prospect of nuclear back in 2006 as a means of leading John Howard to accept the inevitability of carbon pricing. Nuclear energy would need a carbon price in order to be viable, so that technology was a pathway to lead a conservative like Howard to accept emissions trading – a position the Liberals then held until Tony Abbott thought it was politically convenient to weaponise emissions trading as a “carbon tax” and use that to blast the Coalition back into government. Now nuclear is being invoked to leash the Nationals and give the After Dark roster on Sky News something to have #BigFeelings™ about while Liberals work out how on earth to regroup on climate policy over the next three years. Dutton said on Tuesday his new nuclear review would be led by Ted O’Brien. Who, you ask? O’Brien is the new shadow minister for climate change and energy. Dutton then declared it was “high time that Australia had an honest and informed debate on the benefits and costs of nuclear energy”. High time is possibly a little insulting to O’Brien. Back in 2019, when O’Brien was chair of federal parliament’s standing committee on environment and energy, he authored a report intended – as O’Brien put it at the time – to provide “a way forward for nuclear technology in Australia”. Sadly, O’Brien’s path forward proved to be very short. Emerging nuclear technologies only rated a cursory mention in the Morrison government’s subsequent technology roadmap. These technologies had “potential but require R&amp;D and identified deployment pathways”. Here was the sound of an issue being kicked forcefully into the long grass. The Coalition has just been in power for nine years. It had the power to progress a domestic nuclear industry. It didn’t. Now, in opposition, we’ll have O’Brien (2022) agreeing with O’Brien (ignored in 2019), or possibly we’ll have duelling O’Briens. Who says politics is too cruel a profession for closure? I mean no disrespect to O’Brien, who has a couple of masters degrees and proficiency in Chinese. In my book, that makes a person very bright. But what gamechanging insight can he possibly bring to an issue that’s been studied as frequently as nuclear? Only two weeks ago the CSIRO found that wind and solar remains the cheapest source of electricity generation and storage in Australia, even when considering additional integration costs arising due to the variable output of renewables, such as energy storage and transmission. In terms of the viability of small modular reactors, the CSIRO said the “status” of that technology had not changed. It said there were no prospects of any domestic projects “this decade, given the technology’s commercial immaturity and high cost”. That was two weeks ago. Back in 2006, the Switkowski review commissioned by Howard found that nuclear power was likely to be between 20% and 50% more costly to produce than power from a new coal-fired plant at current fossil fuel prices in Australia. It said nuclear would only become competitive in Australia in a system where the costs of greenhouse gas emissions were explicitly recognised, and even then, reactors would require government subsidies. Ziggy Switkowski appeared before O’Brien’s inquiry in 2019 and said there was no coherent business case to finance an Australian nuclear industry before adding: “I have emphasised that one of the things that has changed over the last decade or so is that nuclear power has got more expensive rather than less expensive”. The South Australian government, through a royal commission, also examined the viability of nuclear in 2016 and found it wasn’t a goer. I’m technology agnostic. Climate science tells us the urgent imperative is emissions reduction, so in that context, all technology should be considered. But it is beyond ludicrous for the Coalition to decline to support Labor’s new emissions reduction target on the basis that it might drive up energy prices (which is one of the current excuses) and in the same breath, hail the breakthrough prospects of nuclear energy. If the Coalition seriously wants to advance nuclear energy, then the questions it must answer are simple: 1. What carbon price are you willing to support to make this happen; 2. What level of taxpayer subsidies are you willing to allocate to create a domestic industry; and 3. Why on earth would you subsidise the most expensive form of power when the cheapest form of power generation already exists and has none of the downsides of nuclear? Anything else is just total bullshit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-398-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-28T15:37:31Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 398 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-398-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-398-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 398 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine is aiming to exhaust and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to capture the small eastern city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said in a video posted on Tuesday. In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. “As of today, our main task is to wear down the overwhelming forces of the enemy and inflict heavy losses on them. It will create the necessary conditions to help liberate Ukrainian land and speed up our victory.” Ukraine’s frontline city of Avdiivka “is being wiped off the face of the Earth” amid intensifying Russian shelling, according to its top local official. Starting on Sunday, the city’s utilities will begin to be shut off as “more and more of the town is shelled and destroyed daily,” said Vitaliy Barabash, the city’s military administration head. Russian forces launched 24 airstrikes, 12 missile strikes and carried out 55 attacks from rocket salvo systems in the last 24 hours, according the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. Multiple explosions were reported in Kyiv on Monday night, according to the mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko. Klitschko said a shop caught fire in the west but there were no immediate reports of casualties. Kyiv air defence said it shot down all drones involved. A cultural centre and a children’s playground, as well as five private houses, were hit in the border village of Chernatske in Sumy, while a hospital was struck in the Dnipro district of Kherson. Possible drone attacks against vital energy infrastructure are a serious threat to Russia’s energy security, energy minister Nikolai Shulginov said on Tuesday. Shulginov did not mention Ukraine by name, but Russia says it has foiled a number of attempted Ukrainian drone attacks in recent months. Oleksii Reznikov, the Ukrainian defence minister, posted a video thanking the UK for the first British Challenger 2 main battle tanks to arrive in Ukraine. “These fantastic machines will soon begin their combat missions,” he wrote on Twitter. Germany’s much-awaited shipment of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks has arrived in Ukraine, the German defence ministry has confirmed. “As promised, our tanks have arrived on time in the hands of our Ukrainian friends”, Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, said on Monday night. “I am sure that they can make the difference on the front.” Belarus’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it had been forced to house Russian nuclear weapons on its territory by the aggressive actions of Nato countries that were threatening Belarus’s own security. Romania and Poland are in talks with the European Commission over export tracing mechanisms for Ukrainian grain to ensure local farmers are not hurt by a flood of cheap Ukrainian imports, the Polish and Romanian prime ministers said on Tuesday. The UK and Poland will build two temporary villages in western and central Ukraine to provide housing for people who have been forced from their homes by Russia’s invasion, the UK government has said. The villages in Lviv and Poltava will offer accommodation for more than 700 Ukrainians, a fraction of the millions either displaced in Ukraine or who have fled the country since the war began more than a year ago. Alexander Novak, the Russian deputy prime minister, said on Tuesday that Russia needed to focus on boosting energy exports to so-called “friendly” countries, as he said Russian oil supplies to India jumped 22-fold last year. At least two people were killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk on Monday, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko said, adding that a number of high-rise buildings and offices were damaged or destroyed. Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted a video clip that showed vehicles on fire and debris strewn across the road. Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president visited Ukraine’s northern Sumy region on Tuesday during his tour of areas of the country that have felt the brunt of Russia’s invasion. Zelenskiy met officials and local residents in the city of Okhtyrka, which saw fierce battles last year but was never occupied, and Trostianets, which was occupied by Russian forces for a month and liberated in March 2022. Zelenskiy told the IAEA head, Rafael Grossi on Monday that safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility could not be guaranteed until Russian troops left. The pair met on Monday to discuss the management of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant and had a “rich exchange” according to Grossi. Zelenskiy “visited advanced positions in the Zaporizhzhia region on Monday, learning about the operational situation and presenting awards to the military”, his office said. The UN security council on Monday declined a Russian request to investigate who blew up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Russia, China and Brazil voted in favour of the motion to investigate, but it failed as it lacked the nine votes needed in the 15-nation council to carry. The US deputy ambassador Robert Wood said there was no need with separate investigations already under way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-396-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-26T17:52:45Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 396 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-396-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-396-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 396 of the invasion","bodyText":"Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. Kyiv has reacted to Russia’s plans in Belarus by calling for an emergency meeting of the United Nations security council. In a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described Russia’s plans to station nuclear weapons in Belarus as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, said the Kremlin has taken Belarus as a “nuclear hostage”. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak accused Putin of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resorting to “scare” tactics. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, has cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons on its territory. Borrell tweeted: “#Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation &amp; threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” The US has not seen any indication that Russia has yet moved nuclear weapons to Belarus, the national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said on Sunday. “We have not seen any indication that he [Putin] has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around,” Kirby told CBS. Three people were reported injured and three residential buildings were damaged after an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region. Law enforcement has attributed the blast to a Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV drone “packed with explosives”. None of the people hurt in the blast are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, Putin said in a televised interview broadcast. Putin stated that the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported. The UK Ministry of Defence says that since the start of March 2023, Russia is likely to have launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicle (OWA-UAVS) against targets across Ukraine. It says Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia’s Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk oblast in the north-east. Ukraine will no longer resort to “dangerous” monetary financing to fund the war against Russia, its central bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday. Ukrainian refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, according to research by Thomson Reuters. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence, Hanna Maliar, went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid.” The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said the months-long Russian assault on the city had stalled, mainly as a result of heavy troop losses. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. Several buildings were damaged but no one was injured after the detonation of a naval mine that hit some coastline facilities in Odesa, according to the Odesa city council. The Kyiv Independent quoted authorities as saying that no one was injured. Russian oil company Gazprom reduced gas exports to the EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On 24 March, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5m cubic metres. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2m cubic metres. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/24/us-dismisses-transparently-false-russian-claims-of-ukraine-plan-to-use-dirty-bomb","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-24T02:16:42Z","webTitle":"US dismisses ‘transparently false’ Russian claims of Ukraine plan to use ‘dirty bomb’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/24/us-dismisses-transparently-false-russian-claims-of-ukraine-plan-to-use-dirty-bomb","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/24/us-dismisses-transparently-false-russian-claims-of-ukraine-plan-to-use-dirty-bomb","fields":{"headline":"US dismisses ‘transparently false’ Russian claims of Ukraine plan to use ‘dirty bomb’","bodyText":"The US has rejected as “transparently false” Russia’s evidence-free claim that Ukraine is preparing to use a “dirty bomb” on its own territory as part of an escalation of Vladimir Putin’s war. Secretary of state Antony Blinken told his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, on Sunday “the world would see through any attempt by Russia to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation”, and vowed to continue supporting Kyiv for as long as necessary. Earlier on Sunday, Kuleba denounced Moscow’s claims as “absurd” and “dangerous”, adding: “Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves”. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy reacted swiftly to Moscow’s claims, calling for a united international response. “If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,” Zelenskiy said in a video address on social media. “I believe that now the world should react as harshly as possible.” Zelenskiy said everyone “understands who is the source of everything dirty that can be imagined in this war. It was Russia who blackmailed with the radiation disaster at the Zaporizhzhia NPP [nuclear power plant].” On Sunday, Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, spoke to his British, French and Turkish counterparts and claimed in all three meetings that Ukraine may use a “dirty bomb”, a conventional weapon containing radioactive material. Shoigu also spoke to Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin, but Moscow did not mention the dirty bomb allegations in its statement summarising that call. The Russian minister cited no evidence for this claim as he warned of “possible provocations” on the part of Kyiv. There is no evidence that Ukraine, which gave up its nuclear weapons in the 1990s, has any radioactive material in its military arsenal. The UK Ministry of Defence said in a statement: “Shoigu alleged that Ukraine was planning actions facilitated by western countries, including the UK, to escalate the conflict in Ukraine. The defence secretary refuted these claims and cautioned that such allegations should not be used as a pretext for greater escalation.” The Institute for the Study of War said a “false flag” operation by Russia was unlikely, dismissing Shoigu’s calls as a sabre-rattling move designed to intimidate Ukraine’s western allies and split the Nato alliance. Russia faces continued military setbacks, including the likely loss of western Kherson by the end of the year, it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-397-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-27T14:09:34Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 397 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-397-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-397-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 397 of the invasion","bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the partially occupied region of Zaporizhzhia, where he meet with UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi. The head of the UN’s nuclear agency said they had “a rich exchange on the protection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant”. In a message on Telegram, Ukraine’s president said “I visited the command post of the “Zaporizhzhia” operational group of troops. I presented orders and medals to employees of the security service of Ukraine, the national guard, the national police, the state border guard service, and the state emergency service of Ukraine.” Ukraine’s ground forces commander said on Monday his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Ukraine’s military said Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi had acted during a visit to the eastern frontline to solve “problematic issues that prevent effective execution of combat tasks” and taken “operational decisions aimed at strengthening our capabilities to deter and inflict damage on the enemy”. It gave no details, and did not say when the visit took place, but Syrskyi’s comments signalled again Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll there. Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. At least two people have been killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk on Monday, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration, said. Zelenskiy posted to his official Telegram that“Another day that began with terrorism by the Russian Federation. The aggressor state shelled our Slovyansk. Unfortunately, there is a dead person and victims of various degrees of severity. All services are working on the ground. Help is being provided.” Russian forces launched two missile strikes, 23 airstrikes and 38 attacks from rock salvo systems against Ukrainian troops and infrastructure in popular areas, according to the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. The secretary of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, has said Nato countries are party to the conflict in Ukraine, according to excerpts from an interview with the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta on Monday. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying reports that an attempt was made this morning to assassinate the police chief in occupied Mariupol. It quotes a Russian-installed official in the occupied territory saying “In the morning they blew up the car of police chief Mikhail Moskvin. He is alive, everything is in order.” RIA reported that Ukrainian forces have shelled the Kalininsky district in the occupied city of Donetsk. “There are victims,” it reported, without specifying further. There have also been explosions reported in occupied Melitopol, which Vladimir Rogov, a local Russian-installed leader, ascribed to the work of air defence. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors said on Monday. A Russian diplomat has said Moscow may seek compensation for the damage to the Nord Stream gas pipelines caused by two explosions last September, according to state media. The pipelines are multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects designed to carry Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea. The Kremlin has said it is for all shareholders to decide whether the two pipelines should be mothballed. A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian-appointed social worker in the liberated eastern city of Lyman to five years in prison after finding her guilty of collaborating with Russian authorities, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland said on Monday. Belarus is accusing Poland of heightening tensions between the country and the EU by deliberately slowing the movement of trucks and cars at its border. Belarus says Poland is failing to implement bilateral agreements. Zelenskiy on Sunday urged all Ukrainians to remain engaged with developments in the war, even though fighting has largely been concentrated in the east. “Now, just as it was a year ago, one cannot be mentally far from the war, although thanks to our soldiers, real hostilities are taking place geographically far from many,” said the Ukrainian president in his nightly address. Heavy Russian shelling is turning the Ukrainian town of Avdiivka into a “place from post-apocalyptic movies”, according to the city’s military administration head, Vitaliy Barabash. Reuters reported about 2,000 civilians were left in the city that Ukrainian forces said last week could become a “second Bakhmut”. The number of Russian troops in Belarus has decreased to about 4,000, according to Ukraine. Andriy Demchenko, spokesperson for the State Border Guard Service, said there had been 10,000 in January. The majority of those remaining were training, with the rest transferred back to Russia. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, Putin said Sunday in a televised interview broadcast.

In a written submission to the commission, the minerals council (MCA) said a proposed EU taxonomy for sustainable activities intended to shape investment under a European green deal was inconsistent in how it dealt with clean technologies because it favoured solar, wind and biofuels over nuclear and CCS. The mining lobby group said it was concerned this approach would have a flow-on effect on the types of energy investments backed by EU-based companies across the globe and “increase the cost of reducing CO2 emissions”. It called for an overhaul. InfluenceMap, a London-based thinktank that tracks corporate climate lobbying, said the MCA’s submission suggested it wanted to export its “negative approach to climate policy” by pushing for changes in other parts of the world that would allow continued use of coal and gas. The MCA submission argued there was “no valid basis” for treating CCS and nuclear differently given EU countries currently used coal, gas and nuclear. It quoted the International Energy Agency in saying emissions from existing energy fleets needed to be significantly reduced by 2030 if countries were to achieve the widely held goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The minerals council said this would require technologies such as CCS. “Underpinning the MCA’s concern is the broad-ranging investment impacts the taxonomy will have, not just within the European Union but anywhere European Union-based firms invest,” the submission said. But InfluenceMap’s program manager, Rebecca Vaughan, said the MCA appeared concerned a science-led approach to dealing with the climate crisis would hurt the industries it represented. “While the MCA says it wants the EU to take a technology neutral position, its submission appears to advocate for the continued use of coal and gas with carbon capture utilisation and storage, which is clearly at odds with the commission’s science-based policy,” Vaughan said. The MCA has long been accused of hindering action to tackle the climate crisis in Australia, and campaigned aggressively against Labor’s two attempts to introduce a carbon pricing scheme. In recent years it has come under pressure to change its anti-climate stance from its biggest members, BHP and Rio Tinto. It followed the big mining companies facing repeated calls from their investors to abandon the MCA over its commitment to coal. It resulted in the MCA releasing a climate plan that said it was committed to the Paris agreement and reaching net zero emissions, but did not include a timeframe in which that target should be reached. The EU taxonomy is intended to help it meet a target of at least a 55% cut in its emissions below 1990 levels by 2030 on the way to net zero by 2050. It considers a development sustainable if it makes a substantial contribution to one of six environmental objectives, does no significant harm to any of the other five and complies with minimum business safeguards. The environmental objectives are: climate change mitigation, climate adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. The commission said it expected the taxonomy would “create security for investors, protect private investors from greenwashing, help companies to plan the transition, mitigate market fragmentation and eventually help shift investments where they are most needed”. Tania Constable, the MCA’s chief executive, said “the technology-led transformation required” could not happen without Australia’s minerals and raw materials. She said InfluenceMap had got it wrong. “[It] clearly opposes a lowest-cost, faster-paced approach to global decarbonisation,” she said. “The MCA and all of its members are taking serious action on climate change and are committed to the Paris agreement and its goal of net zero emissions. The MCA advocates the inclusion of all low and zero emissions energy sources in the EU’s sustainable finance taxonomy because unequal treatment of nuclear and CCUS in particular undermines the EU’s own objectives.” The final version of the EU’s sustainable finance rules was due in January but a decision was delayed until April after 10 countries objected to the initial proposal because they wanted gas to be deemed a sustainable energy source. Nuclear energy plays a significant role in some EU countries, but the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported its future was uncertain in wealthy nations as ageing plants were expected to close due to cost and regulatory decisions. It said this trend could affect climate goals. The forecast decline of nuclear has coincided with generation from cheaper renewable energy growing significantly from a low base. CCS, which most commonly involves capturing emissions and pumping them underground, remains at a relatively early stage of development despite pledges of billions of dollars in funding. It is used in some industrial processes, but has sometimes been financially viable only when employed to increase oil extraction from an underground reservoir. It is yet to be proved viable as a means of reducing emissions from fossil fuel power generation. One of the world’s most prominent CCS projects, the Petra Nova power generation facility in Texas, was mothballed last year because of its poor financial performance. The Morrison government has backed CCS as one of five priorities to receive support under its low-emissions technology roadmap, and opened a $50m fund for applications earlier this month. Several observers noted it was a relatively little funding if the government was serious about developing the long-stalled technology. Some of is expected to be will be dedicated to exploring the “use” of captured CO2 to turn it into products such as building materials. Nuclear energy remains banned in Australia. Some Coalition MPs and industry leaders want the prohibition lifted. • This article was amended on 23 March 2021 to include the EU’s criteria for a sustainable activity and the IEA’s assessment of nuclear generation"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/21/tory-leadership-net-zero-investment-lords","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-21T05:01:39Z","webTitle":"Next PM must get a grip on net zero plans or deter investment, warn Lords","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/21/tory-leadership-net-zero-investment-lords","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/21/tory-leadership-net-zero-investment-lords","fields":{"headline":"Next PM must get a grip on net zero plans or deter investment, warn Lords","bodyText":"The next prime minister needs to grab Britain’s net zero plans “by the scruff of the neck” to boost investor confidence, an influential House of Lords committee has said. The economic affairs committee, which counts former Bank of England governor Lord King among its members, has warned Britain is at risk of a “disorderly transition” away from fossil fuels and has urged the government to set out a detailed plan including deadlines for investment decisions. The committee said the invasion of Ukraine had provided a “wake-up call” on the vulnerability of energy supplies and said there was a gap between the government’s low-carbon power generation ambitions and “practical plans for delivery”. In a report, entitled Investing in energy: price, security, and the transition to net zero, the committee made a series of recommendations. These include: a drive to improve home insulation; developing financing models for new technologies including carbon capture and storage; blue and green hydrogen; and re-examining the onshore wind sector. The peers want to see energy security objectives set alongside climate change goals in a National Planning Policy Framework and enabling short-term investment in North Sea oil and gas that will pay back quickly “to limit the risk of stranded assets”. The committee also called for the UK Infrastructure Bank to focus on “financing innovative and potentially riskier projects” and for the Treasury to definitively rule out a windfall tax on power generators. Lord Bridges of Headley, the chair of the committee, said: “I hope the next prime minister understands the needs for an operational delivery plan for net zero because we have a government that has increased ambition but now needs to join the dots between different policies to make sure that we don’t fall into a gap between ambition and delivery. The next PM needs to take this issue by the scruff of its neck and really come up with a plan to deliver.” The report comes days after the high court ordered the government to outline exactly how its net zero policies will achieve emissions targets, after a legal challenge from environmental groups. The committee hopes the government can allay concerns among businesses and investors over returns made from large-scale energy infrastructure projects. Construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant has been delayed and is billions of pounds over budget, while questions remain over the financing of its sister plant, Sizewell C, which has been proposed in Suffolk. Bridges said the UK needed to make sure that in the transition away from fossil fuels it did not become reliant on minerals that are used in renewable power technology such as solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles. He said: “We need to be very focused on ensuring we don’t swap one form of dependency in terms of sources of oil and gas for another source of dependency, which is on countries that own rare earth minerals, supply chains and rare and low-carbon technology, processing and manufacturing, notably China.” In compiling the report, the committee received evidence from experts across the industry including representatives of power station operator EDF, regulator Ofgem, energy firm SSE, consultancy KPMG and Rolls-Royce, which hopes to build a fleet of mini nuclear power stations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/aug/24/san-onofre-nuclear-power-plant-radioactive-waste-unsafe","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-24T10:00:47Z","webTitle":"‘A combination of failures:’ why 3.6m pounds of nuclear waste is buried on a popular California beach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/24/san-onofre-nuclear-power-plant-radioactive-waste-unsafe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/aug/24/san-onofre-nuclear-power-plant-radioactive-waste-unsafe","fields":{"headline":"‘A combination of failures:’ why 3.6m pounds of nuclear waste is buried on a popular California beach","bodyText":"More than 2 million visitors flock each year to California’s San Onofre state beach, a dreamy slice of coastline just north of San Diego. The beach is popular with surfers, lies across one of the largest Marine Corps bases in the Unites States and has a 10,000-year-old sacred Native American site nearby. It even landed a shout-out in the Beach Boys’ 1963 classic Surfin’ USA. But for all the good vibes and stellar sunsets, beneath the surface hides a potential threat: 3.6m lb of nuclear waste from a group of nuclear reactors shut down nearly a decade ago. Decades of political gridlock have left it indefinitely stranded, susceptible to threats including corrosion, earthquakes and sea level rise. The San Onofre reactors are among dozens across the United States phasing out, but experts say they best represent the uncertain future of nuclear energy. “It’s a combination of failures, really,” said Gregory Jaczko, who chaired the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the top federal enforcer, between 2009 and 2012, of the situation at San Onofre. Buried waste That waste is the byproduct of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (Songs), three nuclear reactors primarily owned by the utility Southern California Edison (SCE). Federal regulators had already cited SCE for several safety issues, including leaking radioactive waste and falsified firewatch records. But when a new steam generator began leaking a small amount of radioactivity in January 2012, just one year after it was replaced, it was SCE’s most serious problem yet. A subsequent report from the NRC’s inspector general found federal inspectors had overlooked red flags in 2009, and that SCE had replaced its own steam generators without proper approval. SCE tried to fix the problem but decided in 2013 to shut the plant down for good. Activists thought they had scored a victory when the reactor shut down – until they learned that the nuclear waste they had produced would remain on-site. That wasn’t supposed to be the case. Under the US Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the federal government was to move waste into a centralized, remote federal facility starting in 1998. In 2002, George W Bush approved Yucca Mountain, a site about 100 miles from Las Vegas, as a permanent underground nuclear waste repository. But in 2010, the Obama administration scrapped the controversial plan. Without a government-designated place to store the waste, the California Coastal Commission in 2015 approved the construction of an installation at San Onofre to store it until 2035. In August 2020, workers concluded the multi-year burial process, loading the last of 73 canisters of waste into a concrete enclosure. San Onofre is not the only place where waste is left stranded. As more nuclear sites shut down, communities across the country are stuck with the waste left behind. Spent fuel is stored at 76 reactor sites in 34 states, according to the Department of Energy. Handling those stockpiles has been an afterthought to the NRC, the federal enforcer, said Allison Macfarlane, another former commission chair. “It was not a big topic at the NRC, unfortunately,” Macfarlane said. “In the nuclear industry in general the backend of the nuclear cycle gets very little attention. So it just never rises to ‘oh this is a very important issue, we should be doing something.’” Plenty of risks, and not enough oversight The waste is buried about 100ft from the shoreline, along the I-5 highway, one of the nation’s busiest thoroughfares, and not far from a pair of faults that experts say could generate a 7.4 magnitude earthquake. Another potential problem is corrosion. In its 2015 approval, the Coastal Commission noted the site could have a serious impact on the environment down the line, including on coastal access and marine life. “The [installation] would eventually be exposed to coastal flooding and erosion hazards beyond its design capacity, or else would require protection by replacing or expanding the existing Songs shoreline armoring,” the document says. Concerns have also been raised about government oversight of the site. Just after San Onofre closed, SCE began seeking exemptions from the NRC’s operating rules for nuclear plants. The utility asked and received permission to loosen rules on-site, including those dealing with record-keeping, radiological emergency plans for reactors, emergency planning zones and on-site staffing. San Onofre isn’t the only closed reactor to receive exemptions to its operating licence. The NRC’s regulations historically focused on operating reactors and assumed that, when a reactor shut down, the waste would be removed quickly. It’s true that the risk of accidents decreases when a plant isn’t operating, said Dave Lochbaum, former director of the nuclear safety project for the Union of Concerned Scientists. But adapting regulations through exemptions greatly reduces public transparency, he argued. “Exemptions are wink-wink, nudge-nudge deals with the NRC,” he said. “In general, it’s not really a great practice,” former NRC chair Jaczko said about the exemptions. “If the NRC is regulating by exemption, it means that there’s something wrong with the rules … either the NRC believes the rules are not effective, and they’re not really useful, or the NRC is not holding the line where the NRC should be holding line,” he said. Close calls In 2015, the NRC tried unsuccessfully to revise its decommissioning rules and reduce the need for exemptions. But commissioners never acted, despite a 2019 Office of Inspector General audit that questioned whether the rule would ever see the light of day and that estimated that eliminating exemptions could save the NRC, utility and taxpayers about $19m for each reactor. “The problem you have here is that the NRC is simply not doing its job as a regulator. So what it has done is allowed the industry to basically determine the conditions under which this material is stored on a temporary basis across the country,” echoed retired Rear Admiral Len Hering, who served more than 30 years in the US navy and was awarded a 2005 presidential award for leadership in federal energy management from President George W Bush. Meanwhile, at San Onofre, two close calls drew the ire of activists and townspeople. In 2018, workers found a loose piece of equipment in one of the canisters, causing a 10-day work stoppage to ensure the error didn’t pose a threat to the public. In a separate incident several months later, a canister filled with radioactive waste became wedged when employees were loading it into the ground and nearly dropped 18ft. The second incident was not made public until a whistleblower brought it up at a community event. After these incidents, the NRC cited SCE for failing to ensure equipment was available to protect the canister from a drop, and failing to notify the NRC in a timely manner. In a memo, NRC staff told SCE it was “concerned about apparent weaknesses” in managing storage oversight. SCE was fined $116,000 but permitted to continue loading casks within one year. Another concern is that the CEO of Holtec, the manufacturer of the canisters, told a 2014 community meeting that the canisters are difficult to repair. “It’s not practical to repair a canister if it were damaged,” Kris Singh said. Singh walked that statement back last September, but questions remain as to what San Onofre would do if a canister did indeed appear damaged. According to a plan the California Coastal Commission approved in July 2020, SCE will also inspect two of the 73 buried canisters every five years, and a test canister every two and a half years, starting in 2024. But critics say they are not confident SCE would self-report given the utility’s record. “It’s a self-reporting industry,” Hering, the retired rear admiral, said. “And they simply can’t be trusted.” Thinking about ‘how systems will fail’ Holtec did not responded to requests for comment for this story. In an email, a spokesman for the NRC declined to comment on the 2018 incidents at San Onofre, and said that possible accidents are significantly fewer than at an operating reactor. “The NRC has thoroughly reviewed this issue and believes that the spent fuel can be stored safely on site at San Onofre. It can’t be moved off site because there is no federally approved disposal site for high-level waste, although we are currently reviewing two applications for interim storage facilities in west Texas and New Mexico,” the spokesman said. Al Bates, manager of regulatory affairs at San Onofre, said there was a probability that incidents “manmade or by Mother Nature” might happen at San Onofre. But if they do, he said, there would be little impact on public safety. “The fact of the matter is, there’s, yes, it’s high-level nuclear waste. But, yes, the technologies that we’re using are extremely robust for any possible scenarios,” he said. He also disputed that the exemption process leaves the public out of the process, noting that requests are public record and that SCE adds information about decommissioning to its website and through a community panel. “It’s an open book,” Bates said. “We’re not trying to get away with anything. We’re doing the same thing that other utilities have done to rightsize regulations around the true nature of decommissioning and the fact that decommissioning is a much lower risk to the public … therefore regulations have to correctly acknowledge that.” “We have no motivation to hide anything. As a matter of fact, if you want to lose your job in nuclear power try to hide something – you’ll never work in nuclear power again,” said Randall Granaas, senior nuclear engineer at San Onofre. John Dobken, spokesperson for Songs, also stressed that the waste is stored safely, but said the right thing to do would be to relocate the waste off-site – a decision only the government can make. “It’s important to know there are some who want to make this about fear and it shouldn’t be about fear,” he said. “It should be about doing the right thing, and the right thing is about relocating the spent fuel from an interim storage site and eventually into a geological repository, and that’s what we’re working towards.” However, many of these potential problems might have been avoided, Jaczko said, if SCE had considered another location for its fuel, instead of leaving it on the reactor site, or if it had more adequately consulted with the community. “I think that a better solution could be had with a little bit more work. And it wasn’t done and now it’s created this very polarized community that has strong concerns about what’s being done and doesn’t feel like they’re being listened to. And they’re not,” he said. It’s worth considering how things fail, though, argued Rod Ewing, nuclear security professor at Stanford University’s center for international security and cooperation, and author of a 2021 report about spent nuclear waste that focuses on San Onofre. “The problem with our safety analysis approach is we spend a lot of time proving things are safe. We don’t spend much time imagining how systems will fail,” he said. “And I think the latter is what’s most important.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/07/russia-ukraine-war-liz-truss-pledges-full-backing-to-ukraine-un-finds-extensive-damage-to-nuclear-plant-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T18:30:14Z","webTitle":"Putin threatens to ‘freeze’ west by cutting oil and gas supplies if EU imposes price cap – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/07/russia-ukraine-war-liz-truss-pledges-full-backing-to-ukraine-un-finds-extensive-damage-to-nuclear-plant-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/07/russia-ukraine-war-liz-truss-pledges-full-backing-to-ukraine-un-finds-extensive-damage-to-nuclear-plant-live","fields":{"headline":"Putin threatens to ‘freeze’ west by cutting oil and gas supplies if EU imposes price cap – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine has launched a surprise counterattack in the north-east Kharkiv region, stretching Russian forces who are also facing Ukrainian attacks in the south. An official representing the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said Ukrainian forces “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. Ukrainian forces are planning for a long and brutal campaign with the goal of taking back most of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson by the end of the year, according to reports. Ukraine’s goal of recapturing Kherson by the end of 2022 is ambitious but possible, US officials said. Ukrainian troops could be in a position to seize the entire right bank of the Dnieper River, including Kherson city, by October, according to a former French general. Ukrainian forces have methodically prepared their counterattack in the southern Kherson region, launching offensives on “almost the entire southern frontline”, Gen Dominique Trinquand, former head of the French military mission to the UN, said. Ukraine’s top military chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, has claimed responsibility for a series of strikes on Russian airbases in Crimea. The strikes used missiles or rockets and 10 warplanes were destroyed, he said. The attacks Zaluzhnyi took responsibility for reportedly included the devastating August strike on the Saki military facility. Russia has reportedly resumed shelling near Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine, a day after the UN called for a demilitarised zone around the plant. A local official said the city of Nikopol – on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Zaporizhzhia – was fired on with rockets and heavy artillery. The report has not been independently verified. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged residents of Russian-occupied areas around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to evacuate for their own safety. The town of Enerhodar, which serves the nuclear plant, has come under fire from Russian forces and lost electricity, according to its exiled Ukrainian mayor. Ukraine’s nuclear chief has said he would support the deployment of UN peacekeepers in the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Remarks by Petro Kotyn, the head of Ukraine’s nuclear agency Energoatom, came a day after the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for a demilitarised zone around the nuclear plant, involving the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency has warned we are facing “a very grave danger” as shelling continues at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. In his first television interview since leading an expert mission to the Russian-held plant, Rafael Grossi said what was “urgently needed” was to establish a protection or shield around the perimeter of the facility. The head of the EU executive has set out plans for windfall taxes, mandatory electricity savings and a cap on the price of Russian gas to limit Kremlin revenues used to finance the “atrocious” war in Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen outlined a five-point plan in response to an energy price crisis, driven by the Russian shutdown of the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline but exacerbated by the climate crisis and lingering effects of the Covid pandemic. Vladimir Putin has threatened to cut off energy supplies if price caps are imposed on Russia’s oil and gas exports. Russia would walk away from its supply contracts if the west went ahead with its plans, Putin said, warning that Russia would “sentence the wolf’s tail to be frozen”. The leader of Russia’s governing party has proposed that a referendum should be held in occupied regions of Ukraine on 4 November on whether to become part of Russia. Andrei Turchak, head of Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party, said it would be “correct and symbolic” to hold votes on that date, a Russian public holiday which is celebrated as the Day of National Unity. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin will meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Uzbekistan next week, according to a Russian official. The pair plan to meet on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s summit in the Uzbek city of Samarkand on 15-16 September, Russia’s ambassador to China Andrei Denisov told reporters. It would the first face-to-face between the two leaders since Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have reached an agreement in principle to restrict the entry of Russian citizens travelling from Russia and Belarus, the Latvian foreign minister said. Edgars Rinkēvičs said the increase of border crossings by Russian citizens was “a public security issue […] also an issue of a moral and political nature”. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thank you for reading. James Cleverly has reaffirmed the UK’s “steadfast support” for Ukraine in his first call as foreign secretary. The Foreign Office said he spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart on Wednesday. In a statement shared on social media, Cleverly said: I just spoke to Dmytro Kuleba in my first call as foreign secretary. I reaffirmed the UK’s steadfast support for Ukraine as they resist Putin’s barbaric invasion. What happens in Ukraine matters to us all and I will do everything possible to assist their fight for freedom. The leader of Russia’s governing party has proposed that a referendum should be held in occupied regions of Ukraine on 4 November on whether to become part of Russia. Andrei Turchak, head of Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party, said it would be “correct and symbolic” to hold votes on that date, a Russian public holiday which is celebrated as the Day of National Unity. Pro-Russian officials in occupied parts of Ukraine had previously suggested that a referendum on joining Russia would be held on 11 September. But on Monday, Russia-appointed officials in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine said they are “pausing” a planned referendum because of attacks by Ukrainian forces. Writing on his party’s website today, Turchak said that in any case, voting would “definitely” take place this year. Ukrainian troops could be in a position to seize the entire right bank of the Dnieper River, including Kherson city, by October, according to a former French general. Ukrainian forces have methodically prepared their counterattack in the southern Kherson region, launching offensives on “almost the entire southern frontline”, Gen Dominique Trinquand, former head of the French military mission to the UN, said in an interview with France 24. The Ukrainian counteroffensive appears to be “progressing well”, he said, adding: The Russians seem surprised by the methods used. The destruction of ammunition depots and logistical hubs, particularly the railroads, have considerably destabilised them. Today, if the forces stationed west of the Dnieper River no longer receive shells, they will no longer be able to defend themselves. If they no longer receive food, it will be dramatic for some units. He also said: I think that before the winter, the Ukrainians could take over the whole right bank of the Dnieper, including the city of Kherson. If Ukraine succeeded in retaking this region, it would be a “major coup” and would be “very damaging” for Vladimir Putin, he added. Russian natural gas deliveries to the EU have dropped by 48% so far this year, according to the Russian gas giant Gazprom. Russia is in talks about a major infrastructure project to deliver gas to China via Mongolia, Vladimir Putin said earlier today. Gazprom has for years explored the possibility of supplying gas to China via Mongolia through a gas pipeline, the Power of Siberia 2. The proposed pipeline could carry 50bn cubic metres of natural gas a year, Gazprom has said, which is slightly less than the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that links Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. In a televised meeting with Mongolia’s prime minister, Luvsannamsrai Oyun-Erdene, Putin said: We are in discussions about the possible implementation of a major infrastructure project, I mean the supply of Russian gas to China via Mongolia. The Kyiv Independent’s defence reporter, Illia Ponomarenko, has said “something incredible” is happening in the north-east Kharkiv region. Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region is reportedly seeing some success. On Tuesday, a Moscow-appointed official in the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said Ukrainian forces had “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. The Wall Street Journal’s Yaroslav Trofimov reports that the speed of Ukraine’s advance has left many stunned. Ukrainian forces are planning for a long and brutal campaign with the goal of taking back most of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson by the end of the year, CNN reports. Since launching its counteroffensive last week, Ukrainian forces have made gains in the south with ambitious ground assaults after sustained attacks on command posts, ammunition stores, and fuel reserves far behind the frontlines, according to geolocation of video and satellite imagery. The US has seen Ukraine achieve some success in attacking Russian supply lines, with the intention of cutting off and isolating Russian troops currently deployed west of the Dnipro River, according to a senior US official. According to Ukrainian officials, the goal is to take at least all territory north or west of the Dnipro River, including not only the city of Kherson but also Nova Kakhovka. Nova Kakhovka houses an important hydroelectric plant as well as a canal that supplies Crimea with much of its water. At the same time, Ukraine has stepped up attacks in the east of the country in order to prevent Russia from shifting forces to the south to attempt to repel the Ukrainian counteroffensive there, according to US officials. Ukraine’s goal of recapturing Kherson by the end of 2022 is ambitious but possible, US officials said. Vladimir Putin has said he wants to revise a fragile international agreement to allow the export of Ukrainian grain in a move that could threaten the deal and revive fears of a renewed Russian naval blockade in the Black Sea. During a bellicose speech at an economic conference in Vladivostok, Putin said he would speak with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, about “limiting the destinations for grain exports”, issuing a false claim that only two of 87 ships leaving Ukraine with grain had gone to developing countries. The divisive statements came during a speech in which Putin also threatened to cut off all deliveries of gas, oil, and coal to Europe if they imposed a price cap on Russian energy imports. Recalling a Russian fairytale, he said that Europeans could “freeze like the wolf’s tail”. The speech, nominally dedicated to the economy and trade, was one of the Russian leader’s most belligerent and defiant since the beginning of the Ukraine war. At one point, Putin declared that Russia had “lost nothing” in launching a war that has killed tens of thousands of people, including thousands of its own soldiers. “We haven’t lost anything and we won’t lose anything,” said Putin, when asked about the cost of the invasion, which began more than six months ago. “The main gain is the strengthening of our sovereignty. Read the full story by Andrew Roth. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged residents of Russian-occupied areas around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to evacuate for their own safety. In a post on Telegram, Vereshchuk said: I appeal to the residents of the districts adjacent to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant … evacuate! Find a way to get to (Ukrainian) controlled territory. The town of Enerhodar, which serves the nuclear plant, has come under fire from Russian forces and lost electricity, according to its exiled Ukrainian mayor. Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz has spoken with Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to pledge his country’s continued support for Kyiv, a German government spokesperson said. The pair discussed further ways to help Ukraine, including measures to assist in the country’s reconstruction, the spokesperson said. During the call, Scholz outlined intense preparations for an international conference on this matter, to be held in Berlin on 25 October, they added. Scholz and Zelenskiy also agreed that protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was of great importance, and backed measures recommended in yesterday’s IAEA report which called for a protection zone around the site. Britain’s newly appointed foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has spoken with Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, to discuss working together to persuade other countries to support Kyiv against Russia’s invasion, Kuleba said. Kuleba tweeted that he and Cleverly “see eye to eye on the main goal: Ukraine must win”. He added: We will work actively together to persuade others across the globe to support it, especially those who may still have doubts. The Ukrainian foreign minister said he was Cleverly’s first call following his appointment by Liz Truss as her foreign minister on Tuesday. Kuleba said: The fact that our call was foreign secretary’s first speaks for itself. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine has launched a surprise counterattack in the north-east Kharkiv region, stretching Russian forces who are also facing Ukrainian attacks in the south. An official representing the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said Ukrainian forces “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. Ukraine has claimed to have destroyed a key strategic bridge used by Russian forces in Kherson. Ukraine’s armed forces shared a series of satellite images purporting to show the damaged structure on Tuesday night. The military added that the images show “significant damage to the Daryiv bridge itself” as well as damage to a building near the river. A “parallel” Ukrainian counteroffensive is occurring in eastern and north-eastern Ukraine as well as in the south, a senior presidential adviser has claimed. Writing on Telegram, Oleksiy Arestovych said in the coming months, Ukraine could expect the defeat of Russian troops in the Kherson region on the western bank of the Dnieper and a significant Ukraine advance in the east. Ukraine’s top military chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, has claimed responsibility for a series of strikes on Russian airbases in Crimea. The strikes used missiles or rockets and 10 warplanes were destroyed, he said. The attacks Zaluzhnyi took responsibility for reportedly included the devastating August strike on the Saki military facility. Russia has reportedly resumed shelling near Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine, a day after the UN called for a demilitarised zone around the plant. A local official said the city of Nikopol – on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Zaporizhzhia – was fired on with rockets and heavy artillery. The report has not been independently verified. Ukraine is considering shutting down its Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant for safety reasons, according to Kyiv’s top nuclear safety expert. Oleh Korikov also expressed concerns about the reserves of diesel fuel used for backup generators. Ukraine’s nuclear chief has said he would support the deployment of UN peacekeepers in the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Remarks by Petro Kotyn, the head of Ukraine’s nuclear agency Energoatom, came a day after the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for a demilitarised zone around the nuclear plant, involving the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency has warned we are facing “a very grave danger” as shelling continues at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. In his first television interview since leading an expert mission to the Russian-held plant, Rafael Grossi said what was “urgently needed” was to establish a protection around the perimeter of the facility. The head of the EU executive has set out plans for windfall taxes, mandatory electricity savings and a cap on the price of Russian gas to limit Kremlin revenues used to finance the “atrocious” war in Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen outlined a five-point plan in response to an energy price crisis, driven by the Russian shutdown of the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline but exacerbated by the climate crisis and lingering effects of the Covid pandemic. Vladimir Putin has threatened to cut off energy supplies if price caps are imposed on Russia’s oil and gas exports. Russia would walk away from its supply contracts if the west went ahead with its plans, Putin said, warning that Russia would “sentence the wolf’s tail to be frozen”. Germany is well placed to “survive” the winter despite turmoil in the energy markets, its chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. Scholz vowed that Germany will keep moving “at great speed” to shed its reliance on Russia for power, adding that gas reserves were at over 86% capacity and would be used to heat homes, generate electricity and power industry. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin will meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Uzbekistan next week, according to a Russian official. The pair plan to meet on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s summit in the Uzbek city of Samarkand on 15-16 September, Russia’s ambassador to China Andrei Denisov told reporters. It would the first face-to-face between the two leaders since Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have reached an agreement in principle to restrict the entry of Russian citizens travelling from Russia and Belarus, the Latvian foreign minister said. Edgars Rinkēvičs said the increase of border crossings by Russian citizens was “a public security issue […] also an issue of a moral and political nature”. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today with all the latest from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Ukraine has launched a surprise counterattack in the north-east Kharkiv region, stretching Russian forces who are also facing Ukrainian attacks in the south. An official representing the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. “Today, the Ukrainian armed forces, after prolonged artillery preparation … began an attack on Balakliia,” Daniil Bezsonov said on Telegram. “At this time, Balakliia is in operative encirclement and within the firing range of Ukrainian artillery. All approaches are cut off by fire,” he said, adding that a successful Ukrainian offensive would threaten Russian forces in Izium, a strategically important town that Russia has been using for its own offensive in eastern Ukraine. Unverified footage circulating on social media on Wednesday showed what looked like a Ukrainian soldier posing in front of the entrance sign for Balakliia. Analysts have said that the initial target of the offensive could be the city of Kupyansk, a key road hub for Russian supplies heading south from the border into eastern Ukraine. Read the full story by my colleagues Pjotr Sauer and Isobel Koshiw. Russia has reportedly resumed shelling near Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine, a day after the UN called for a demilitarised zone around the plant. A local official told the Associated Press on Wednesday that the city of Nikopol – on the opposite bank if the Dnieper river from Zaporizhzhia – was fired on with rockets and heavy artillery. The report has not been independently verified. Regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said: There are fires, blackouts and other things at the [plant] that force us to prepare the local population for the consequences of the nuclear danger. In recent days, residents have been given iodine pills to help protect them from a radiation leak. The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, warned the UN Security Council on Tuesday that “something very, very catastrophic could take place” at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA urged Russia and Ukraine to establish a “nuclear safety and security protection zone” around the plant. It is feared that fighting could lead to a disaster on the scale of Chernobyl. The resumption of grain exports from Ukraine and maintaining food and fertiliser supplies contributed to a drop in global wheat prices in August, the UN has said. It came after Vladimir Putin called for talks to change the UN-brokered deal, signed in July to avoid a global food crisis, claiming exports were not going to the world’s poorest countries as planned. A UN spokesperson for the Black Sea Grain Initiative told Reuters: In August, the Food and Agriculture Organisation cereal price index decreased by 1.4% from the previous month. This drop...was due in part to the resumption of commercial exports from the Black Sea ports in Ukraine. According to UN data, Turkey, which is not part of the EU, has been the most common single destination for Ukraine shipments and that they have also been sent to China, India, Egypt, Yemen, Somalia and Djibouti. The spokesperson added: As of today...we have seen 100 ships leaving Ukrainian ports carrying over 2,334,310 metric tons of grains and other foodstuffs across three continents, including 30 percent to low and lower-middle income countries. Ukraine’s top military chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, has claimed responsibility for a series of strikes on Russian airbases in Crimea. In an article published by Ukrinform, a state news agency, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian army said the strikes used missiles or rockets and that 10 warplanes were destroyed. The attacks he took responsibility for included the devastating August strike on the Saki military facility, reports Reuters. The head of the EU executive has set out plans for windfall taxes, mandatory electricity savings and a cap on the price of Russian gas to limit Kremlin revenues used to finance the “atrocious” war in Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen outlined a five-point plan in response to an energy price crisis, driven by the Russian shutdown of the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline but exacerbated by the climate crisis and lingering effects of the Covid pandemic. Low-carbon energy companies, renewable and nuclear suppliers that have reaped “enormous revenues … they never dreamed of” from generating electricity will face a windfall tax, Von der Leyen said, with proceeds earmarked to help domestic consumers and companies pay “astronomical” bills. Under EU energy rules, the price of electricity is determined by the cost of the most expensive fuel, usually gas, rather than cheaper renewables and nuclear power. As a result of all-time-high gas prices, low-carbon electricity generators have been rewarded with a big increase in income. “These revenues do not reflect their production costs,” Von der Leyen said. “So it is now time for the consumers to benefit from the low costs of low-carbon sources.” The commission, she said, proposed “to re-channel these unexpected profits” to allow member states to support vulnerable households and companies. Ukraine’s nuclear chief has said he would support the deployment of UN peacekeepers in the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Petro Kotyn, the head of Ukraine’s nuclear agency Energoatom, said in remarks broadcast by Ukrainian TV: One of the ways to create a security zone at the ZNPP could be to set up a peacekeeping contingent there and withdraw Russian troops. Kotyn’s remarks came a day after the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for a demilitarised zone around the nuclear plant, involving the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in. Former UK defence secretary Michael Fallon clashed with the French president Emmanuel Macron saying he did not understand those who say that Russian president Vladimir Putin should not be left humiliated at the end of the Ukraine war. Macron has at times called for Putin not to win, but also not to be humiliated. But Fallon, speaking at an economic forum in Poland, said: I do not understand people that say that Putin must not be humiliated by failure. He needs to fail and to be humiliated if we are not to concede he has any kind of legitimate right to be any part of Ukraine. If we weaken now by allowing Russia to continue along this path it seems the Baltic States, Moldova, Georgia, the West Balkans - all of them - will be vulnerable in the future. Fallon was defence secretary from 2014 and 2017 in the wake of the Russian-led incursion into Ukraine, and in his remarks described the West’s response at the time as feeble. He also called for the West to consider providing Ukraine with a modern air defence iron dome as a permanent form of security against future Russian attacks, possibly with a Polish contribution. Describing the state of the military counter-offensive inside Ukraine as “at a delicate stage”, he said the level of sanctions against Russia should not only be stepped up, but enforced since some countries were allowing Russian oil to be retankered and relabelled in international customs. He added: Politicians need to better and more fully explain the sacrifice that is going to be required not just in the field of energy but in terms of fiscal transfers. This is a war not just of territory but of principle. Fallon also called for the Russian middle class to be banned from travelling across Europe: Young Russians can enjoy the beaches of the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea whereas every young Ukrainians has in one way or another to defend their country. Even in an autocratic regime where the media is controlled, you cannot exempt the Russian population from proper responsibility for what is being done in their name. He also revealed his deep exasperation with Europe’s response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. He said Putin noticed the west’s weak response to the Maidan in 2004, when the European Union proved itself wholly unable to defend a fragile democracy. Putin noticed again when Europe applied only limited sanctions after the seizure of Crimea, excluding oil and gas, and unbelievably allowing 10 European countries to honour their existing arms contracts to Russia supplying weapons that even today are being used against Ukraine. Above all, Putin noted the lack of a clear path for Nato and EU membership, Fallon said. He said Poland by contrast recognised what Putin represented long before the rest of Europe, and called on the UK to build its ad hoc defence links with Poland and Ukraine in the future. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin will meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Uzbekistan next week, according to a Russian official. The pair plan to meet on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s summit in the Uzbek city of Samarkand on 15-16 September, Russia’s ambassador to China Andrei Denisov told reporters. Denisov was quoted by Russian state-run news agency Tass as saying: We are actively preparing for it. It would the first face-to-face between the two leaders since Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February. It would also be the Chinese leader’s first overseas trip since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. Xi has only left mainland China once since the start of the pandemic, to make a one-day visit to Hong Kong. The summit “promises to be interesting”, Denisov was also cited as saying. He added: I do not want to say that online summits are not full-fledged, but still, direct communication between leaders is a different quality of discussion … We are planning a serious, full-fledged meeting of our leaders with a detailed agenda, which we are now, in fact, working on with our Chinese partners. When asked about the trip, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said he had “nothing to offer” and did not provide any information. Germany is well placed to “survive” the winter despite turmoil in the energy markets, its chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. Scholz vowed that Germany will keep moving “at great speed” to shed its reliance on Russia for power, in a speech to parliament that was heavily critical of his predecessor chancellor Angela Merkel’s energy policies. Germany has worked effectively to fill up its gas storage tanks and by speeding up the building of terminals to receive liquefied natural gas, Scholz said. The gas reserves, currently over 86% capacity, will be used to heat homes, generate electricity and power industry. He added: Because we started so early, when it wasn’t even such a big awareness of the problem in Germany, we are now in a situation that we can head into the winter courageously and bravely - our country can survive. He said he was working to seal new cooperation with close European partners in order to “guarantee a secure energy supply” for the country. We have spoken with our friends on the west European coast, with the Netherlands and Belgium for them to expand (LNG) terminals and pipeline capacities with France which will for the first time deliver gas to us. Vladimir Putin has threatened to cut off energy supplies if price caps are imposed on Russia’s oil and gas exports. Speaking at an economic forum in Vladivostok in Russia’s far east, the president said Russia “will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests … We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil – we will not supply anything.” A Ukrainian presidential adviser has described Russian complaints about a landmark deal allowing Ukraine to export grain from ports in the Black Sea as “flabbergasting”. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told Reuters: The agreements signed in Istanbul … concern only one issue, and that is the transfer of cargo ships through the Black Sea. He added: Russia can’t dictate where Ukraine should send its grain, and Ukraine doesn’t dictate the same to Russia. Russia’s foreign ministry has announced sanctions against a number of European military leaders and security figures in response to what Moscow described as the west’s “unfriendly anti-Russian” policy. In a statement, it said it was banning a number of the European military leaders, senior security figures and representatives of weapons companies from entering Russia. The ministry did not name the individuals. Speaking at an economic forum in Vladivostok, Vladimir Putin threatened to cut off energy supplies if price caps are imposed on Russia’s oil and gas exports. The Russian leader described European calls for a price cap on Russian gas as “stupid” and said they would lead to higher global prices and economic problems in Europe. Last week, G7 countries agreed on a plan to put a ceiling on Russian oil prices in an attempt to stem the flow of funds into the Kremlin’s war coffers. Russia would walk away from its supply contracts if the west went ahead with its plans, Putin said. The Russian president said: Will there be any political decisions that contradict the contracts? Yes, we won’t fulfill them. We will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests. He added: We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil – we will not supply anything. Russia “would only have one thing left to do”, Putin said. As in the famous Russian fairytale, we would sentence the wolf’s tail to be frozen. He said Germany and western countries themselves were to blame for the Nord Stream 1 pipeline not being operational and that Ukraine and Poland decided on their own to switch off other gas routes into Europe. He added: Nord Steam 1 is practically closed now. Hello everyone. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, taking over the blog from Tobi Thomas to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far: Ukraine is considering shutting down its Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant for safety reasons, according to Kyiv’s top nuclear safety expert. Oleh Korikov also expressed concerns about the reserves of diesel fuel used for backup generators. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of threatening Europe’s nuclear security by shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, and claimed Russia had no military equipment at the facility. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency has warned we are facing “a very grave danger” as shelling continues at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. In his first television interview since leading an expert mission to the Russian-held plant, Rafael Grossi said what was “urgently needed” was to establish a protection around the perimeter of the facility. The UN nuclear watchdog has said its experts found extensive damage at Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a report presented to the UN security council on Tuesday. The report also found Ukrainian staff were operating under constant high stress and pressure where there was an increased possibility of human error. “We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place,” IAEA chief Grossi warned. The UN has called for a demilitarised zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. UN secretary general, António Guterres, urged the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in, and said he supported the recommendations put forward by the IAEA’s Grossi. Ukrainian forces have attacked the Russian-occupied eastern town of Balakliia in the Kharkiv region, a senior Russian-appointed official has said. Bezsonov added that if the town were lost, Russian forces in Izyum would become vulnerable on their north-west flank. Luhansk region governor Serhiy Gaidai told Ukrainian television that a “counter-attack is under way and … our forces are enjoying some success. Let’s leave it at that.” Ukraine has claimed to have destroyed a key strategic bridge used by Russian forces in Kherson. Ukraine’s armed forces shared a series of satellite images purporting to show the damaged structure on Tuesday night. The military added that the images show “significant damage to the Daryiv bridge itself” as well as damage to a building near the river. A “parallel” Ukrainian counteroffensive is occurring in eastern and north-eastern Ukraine as well as in the south, a senior presidential adviser has claimed. Writing on Telegram, Oleksiy Arestovych said in the coming months, Ukraine could expect the defeat of Russian troops in the Kherson region on the western bank of the Dnieper and a significant Ukraine advance in the east. Vladimir Putin has said western sanctions on Russia were short-sighted and a danger for the entire world, which he said was increasingly turning towards Asia. In a speech to the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, he also claimed the developing world had been “cheated” by a landmark grain deal designed to alleviate a food crisis. Britain’s new prime minister Liz Truss and her US counterpart Joe Biden have promised to strengthen their relationship in the face of Vladimir Putin’s aggression. Truss’s call to Biden on Tuesday night followed a conversation with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and focused on what she called ”extreme economic problems caused by Putin’s war”. Putin said the way Britain chooses its leaders is “far from democratic”, a day after Liz Truss replaced Boris Johnson as prime minister. In his first public comments on Truss’s appointment, the Russian president alluded to the fact she was chosen in a leadership ballot by members of the Conservative party, not by the whole country. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have reached an agreement in principle to restrict the entry of Russian citizens travelling from Russia and Belarus, the Latvian foreign minister said. Edgars Rinkēvičs said the increase of border crossings by Russian citizens was “a public security issue […] also an issue of a moral and political nature”. A Russian colonel who served as the military commandant of the occupied Ukrainian city of Berdiansk was reported to have been killed in a car bombing, according to Russian state media reports. Russian officials have alleged that Ukraine was behind the attack on Col Artyom Bardin. If true, it would be the most significant assassination yet of an official working for the occupational government of Russia in Ukraine. Putin has also said that Ukraine had threatened Europe’s nuclear security by shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, and that Russia had no military equipment at the facility. Reuters reports: The Russian president added that he trusted a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which visited the power station last week, but criticised the IAEA for not saying that Ukraine was to blame for shelling on the site. Kyiv and Moscow both blame each other for military attacks on the site which has triggered fears of a Chornobyl-style nuclear disaster at Europe’s largest nuclear power station. Ukraine is considering shutting down its Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant for safety reasons, and is worried about the reserves of diesel fuel used for backup generators, according to Kyiv’s top nuclear safety expert. “The option of switching off the station is being assessed,” Oleh Korikov said during a news briefing on Wednesday. Vladimir Putin has said the way Britain chooses its leaders is “far from democratic”, a day after Liz Truss replaced Boris Johnson as prime minister. In his first public comments on Truss’s appointment, the Russian president alluded to the fact she was chosen in a leadership ballot by members of the Conservative party, and not by the whole country. “The people of Great Britain don’t take part, in this instance, in the change of government. The ruling elites there have their arrangements,” Putin told an economic forum in Vladivostok. Vladimir Putin has claimed that Russia had not lost anything in a global confrontation with the US over the conflict in Ukraine but had actually gained by setting a new sovereign course that would restore its global clout, the Russian president said on Wednesday during a speech to the Eastern Economic Forum. Reuters reports: Putin increasingly casts the conflict in Ukraine, which he calls a “special military operation”, as a turning point in history when Russia finally threw off the humiliations which accompanied the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. In an attempt to underscore Russia’s tilt towards Asia, Putin, speaking to the Eastern Economic Forum in the Russian Pacific city of Vladivostok, said that the West was failing while Asia was the future. In his main speech, Putin hardly mentioned Ukraine beyond a reference to grain exports. But when asked by a moderator if anything had been lost from the conflict, Putin said Russia had gained and would emerge renewed and purged of hindrances. “We have not lost anything and will not lose anything,” Putin, Russia’s paramount leader since 1999, said. “Everything that is unnecessary, harmful and everything that prevents us from moving forward will be rejected.” “In terms of what we have gained, I can say that the main gain has been the strengthening of our sovereignty, and this is the inevitable result of what is happening now,” Putin said. “This will ultimately strengthen our country from within.” He did, though, acknowledge that the conflict had unleashed “a certain polarisation” in both the world and in Russia. In his first television interview since leading an expert mission to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, International Atomic Energy Agency director general Rafael Grossi tells CNN’s Christiane Amanpour we are facing “a very grave danger” as shelling continues at the plant. “The situation continues to be very worrying,” Grossi said. “The shelling continues, so we are still facing a very grave danger. The mere fact there is continuity of attacks and shelling, deliberate or not, wittingly or unwittingly, people are hitting a nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. So I must say that the danger continues.” He continued, underlining the huge dangers posed: “I demand nuclear safety is indispensable. Nuclear security is indispensable. We are playing with fire.” When asked about the IAEA establishing a demilitarised zone around the nuclear plant, Grossi said there must be a differentiation between a demilitarised zone versus creating a “nuclear safety and security zone”. “What we are talking about here is the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone immediately, which is perhaps more modest than a full demilitarisation of the area, but extremely effective in getting commitment from all sides to avoid any aiming at the plant, any shelling at the plant, any use of any means and calibers of artillery in a direction of the plant.” Grossi continued: “What is urgently needed now – today – is that we agree on establishing a protection, a shield, a bubble around the perimeter of the facility. This is not something which is impossible to do – not at all. The IAEA has the mandate to protect the safety and security of the plant and the people there. I hope to consult very quickly and establish this as an interim measure in the hope that there will be further things.” When asked whether the remaining IAEA inspectors would stay at the nuclear plant as part of a permanent mission, Grossi confirmed the IAEA would remain on site. “And if somebody wants us to leave, then let that someone explain why is the IAEA forced to leave.” The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have reached agreement in principle to restrict the entry of Russian citizens travelling from Russia and Belarus, the Latvian foreign minister Edgars Rinkēvičs has said. Reuters reports: “In the last couple of weeks and months the border crossing by Russian citizens holding Schengen visas have dramatically increased. This is becoming a public security issue, this is also an issue of a moral and political nature,” he told a press conference in Lithuania. Vladimir Putin, during the same speech, also claimed that the developing world had been “cheated” by a landmark grain deal designed to alleviate a food crisis. Putin took aim at the deal, brokered by Turkey and the United Nations, saying Ukrainian grain exports were not going to the world’s poorest countries. He said: Once again, they simply deceived developing countries and continue to deceive them. With this approach, the scale of food (supply) issues in the world will only increase, unfortunately. To our great regret, this can lead to an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe.” Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has said the west’s sanctions on the country were short-sighted and a danger for the entire world, which he said was increasingly turning towards Asia. In a speech to the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Putin said the west had undermined the global economy with an “aggressive” attempt to impose its dominance across the world. He added that Russia had done everything it could to ensure Ukraine was able to export grain, but that problems in the global food market were likely to intensify and that a humanitarian catastrophe was looming. Britain’s new prime minister Liz Truss and her US counterpart Joe Biden have promised to strengthen their relationship in the face of Vladimir Putin’s aggression. Truss’s call to Biden on Tuesday night followed a conversation with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and focused on what she called ”extreme economic problems caused by Putin’s war”. Biden and Truss “reinforced their commitment to strengthening global liberty, tackling the risks posed by autocracies and ensuring Putin fails in Ukraine”, according to Downing Street. No 10 noted the “enduring strength of the special relationship” with the US, something that appeared at times strained during the reign of her predecessor, Boris Johnson. The leaders also committed to deepening alliances through Nato and the Aukus defence pact, established to counter China’s dominance in the Indo-Pacific region. The White House said the leaders discussed close cooperation to help Ukraine “defend itself against Russian aggression”, as well as the challenges posed by China, Iran’s ambitions to acquire nuclear weapons, securing sustainable and affordable energy and the need to protect the Good Friday agreement. Truss’s first call to a foreign leader was to Zelenskiy. The prime minister, who is the UK’s fourth Conservative prime minister in six years, told him “Ukraine could depend on the UK’s assistance for the long term” and deplored Putin’s attempts to weaponise energy. Accepting an invitation to visit Ukraine soon, the new prime minister said it was “vital Russia’s blackmail did not deter the west from ensuring Putin fails”, according to Downing Street. Honoured to be the object of Truss’s first call, Zelenskiy hailed what he said would be a “profound and productive relationship” with the new leader, with whom he discussed how to increase the pressure on Russia and raise the costs of its invasion. “It is very important that Great Britain retains a leadership role in consolidating the free world and protecting freedom,” he said. A Russian colonel who served as the military commandant of the occupied Ukrainian city of Berdiansk was reported to have been killed in a car bombing, according to Russian state media reports. The car bomb reportedly exploded near the city administrative headquarters, which is being used as a Russian base. Photographs showed that the car used by the Russian military official, who has been identified as Col Artyom Bardin, was severely damaged in the attack, which took place close to midday. Initial reports indicated that Bardin died from his wounds. But Vladimir Rogov, the Russian-appointed administrative head of the Zaporizhzhia region, said in a Telegram post written just after 8.30pm on Tuesday that the colonel continued to “fight for his life”. Thank God, information about the death of the commandant of Berdyansk Artyom Bardin is not confirmed. Despite severe injuries, explosive leg amputation and massive blood loss, he is alive. Doctors continue to fight for his life,” he said. Russian officials have alleged that Ukraine was behind the attack. If true, it would be the most significant assassination yet of an official working for the occupational government of Russia in Ukraine. Ukraine has claimed to have destroyed a key strategic bridge used by Russian forces in Kherson. Ukraine’s armed forces shared a series of satellite images purporting to show the damaged structure on Tuesday night. “Photo of the destroyed pontoon bridge near Darivka in the Kherson Region,” the force said in a Telegram update. “The Rashists [Russians] used it to cross the Ingulets River.” The military added that the images show “significant damage to the Daryiv bridge itself” as well as damage to a building near the river. “Approximately 250 meters from the crossing, the satellite also recorded a cluster of Russian military equipment and a large number of trenches,” the force added. Moscow has sent a request to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) requesting “additional explanations” on some areas in their report following a visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said the request had been made on Wednesday, according to Russian media outlets. Other Russian officials have criticised the agency for not identifying Ukraine as the perpetrator of attacks on the plant. A “parallel” counteroffensive is occurring in eastern and north-eastern Ukraine as well as in the south, a senior presidential adviser has claimed. Oleksiy Arestovych said on Telegram late on Tuesday night: We are advancing and pressing almost along the entire frontline. In the coming months, we can expect the defeat of the Russian army in the Kherson region on the western bank of the Dnieper and a significant advance of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the east.” Ukrainian forces have attacked the Russian-occupied eastern town of Balakliia in the Kharkiv region, a senior Russian-appointed official has said. The town of 27,000 people lies between Kharkiv and Russian-held Izyum, a city with a major railway hub used by Moscow to supply its forces. Today, the Ukrainian armed forces, after prolonged artillery preparation … began an attack on Balakliia,” Russian official with the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic Daniil Bezsonov said on Telegram on Tuesday, according to a Reuters report. Bezsonov added that if the town were lost, Russian forces in Izyum would become vulnerable on their northwest flank. The Ukrainian armed forces concentrated mass fire on the mobile groups of the Donetsk People’s Republic, which had taken up defensive positions in nearby forests. At this time, Balakliia is in operative encirclement and within the firing range of Ukrainian artillery. All approaches are cut off by fire.” Luhansk region governor Serhiy Gaidai told Ukrainian television, without giving locations, that a “counter-attack is under way and … our forces are enjoying some success. Let’s leave it at that”. Britain’s new prime minister Liz Truss spoke with her Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy to pledge her “full backing” for Ukraine during a call on Tuesday. Truss reiterated the United Kingdom’s “steadfast support” for Ukraine’s freedom and democracy, a statement released by Downing Street read. In her first call with a counterpart since becoming prime minister, she reiterated to the Ukrainian leader that he had her full backing, and Ukraine could depend on the UK’s assistance for the long term. The leaders discussed the need to strengthen global security and the measures necessary to cut off the funds fuelling Putin’s war machine. The leaders deplored Putin’s attempts to weaponise energy, and the prime minister said it was vital Russia’s blackmail did not deter the west from ensuring Putin fails. She also underscored the importance of ensuring the UK and our allies continue to build energy independence.” Zelenskiy said he congratulated Truss on the appointment to her new role, saying he felt that the leaders “will be able to build a profound and productive relationship”. He added that he extended an invite to the new British prime minister to visit Ukraine. The UN has called for a demilitarised zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Secretary general António Guterres urged for the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in. An agreement on a demilitarised perimeter should be secured,” he said. Specifically, that will include the commitment by Russian forces to withdraw military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and the commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move in.” Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters ahead of the council meeting, “if we demilitarise then the Ukrainians will immediately step in and ruin the whole thing.” The UN nuclear watchdog has said its experts found extensive damage at Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a report presented to the UN security council on Tuesday. Director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said his team closely witnessed shelling in the vicinity of the power plant and confirmed the presence of Russian soldiers and military equipment. The report also found Ukrainian staff were operating under constant high stress and pressure where there was an increased possibility of human error. The IAEA said it was “gravely concerned” about the “unprecedented” situation at the plant, which is controlled by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian technicians, and urged interim measures to prevent a nuclear disaster. Ukrainian staff were operating under constant high stress and pressure, especially with the limited staff available, the report said. “This is not sustainable and could lead to increased human error with implications for nuclear safety,” it added. While the ongoing shelling has not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, it continues to represent a constant threat to nuclear safety and security with potential impact on critical safety functions that may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance,” the inspectors wrote. Areas damaged by shelling included a turbine lubrication oil tank and the roofs of various buildings such as one housing a spent fuel transporter vehicle. “We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place,” Grossi said. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. An expert mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has released its findings from the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a detailed report. It is 7.30am in Kyiv. Here is where things stand: The UN has called for a demilitarised zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Secretary general António Guterres urged for the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in. “An agreement on a demilitarised perimeter should be secured,” he said. “Specifically, that will include the commitment by Russian forces to withdraw military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and the commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move in.” Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters ahead of the council meeting, “if we demilitarise then the Ukrainians will immediately step in and ruin the whole thing.” Biden and newly appointed British prime minister, Liz Truss, have vowed to partner against Russia and show their “continued support for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russian aggression” after speaking by phone on Tuesday. A Downing Street spokesperson said Truss reiterated to the Ukrainian leader that he had her full backing, and Ukraine could depend on the UK’s assistance for the long term,” while Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he felt the two leaders “will be able to build a profound and productive relationship”. The UN nuclear watchdog said its experts found extensive damage at the plant in a report presented to the UN security council on Tuesday. Director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said his team closely witnessed shelling in the vicinity of the power plant and confirmed the presence of Russian soldiers and military equipment. The report also found Ukrainian staff were operating under constant high stress and pressure where there was an increased possibility of human error. “We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place,” Grossi said. A “parallel” counteroffensive is occurring in eastern and northeastern Ukraine as well as in the south, a senior presidential adviser has claimed. “We are advancing and pressing almost along the entire frontline,” Oleksiy Arestovych said on Telegram late on Tuesday night. “In the coming months, we can expect the defeat of the Russian army in the Kherson region on the western bank of the Dnieper and a significant advance of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the east.” Ukraine’s major western allies have yet to sign up to establish a tribunal to try Russian president Vladimir Putin and his inner circle for the crime of aggression, wanting to leave space for future relations with Russia, according to Ukraine’s top officials. “It’s big politics. On the one hand, countries publicly condemn the aggression but on the other, they are putting their foot in the closing door on relations with Russia so that it doesn’t close completely,” said Andriy Smyrnov, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration. “They are attempting to keep some space for diplomatic manoeuvres … agreements with Russia are not worth the paper they are written on.” US president Joe Biden’s administration has rejected calls from Ukraine to brand Russia a “state sponsor of terrorism,” saying it would have “unintended consequences” to Ukraine and the world. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the designation would hamper aid delivery to Ukraine or prevent aid groups and companies from participating in a deal brokered by the UN and Turkey to ship grain from Ukraine’s blockaded ports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/13/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-12T20:00:03Z","webTitle":"What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

Catch up with the must-read news and analysis","bodyText":"Putin recycles old grievances on Victory Day Russia launched a fresh wave of drone, missile and airstrikes on cities across Ukraine this week, as Moscow stepped up attacks on the eve of its Victory Day parade commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany. A tumultuous year of fighting has passed since Vladimir Putin last addressed Russian soldiers on Red Square in Moscow to mark the country’s victory over the Nazis. But the Russian leader’s Victory Day message to the nation on Tuesday, made hours after more than a dozen Russian missiles were downed over Kyiv, was nearly identical to that of last year as he cast the war in Ukraine as an existential battle against an aggressive, Russophobic and woke west, writes Pjotr Sauer in his analysis of the celebrations. What was left unspoken by the Russian president was the battering his army has received over the past 12 months in Ukraine, which was revealed by the scaled-down military parade that followed his speech. The muted parade reflects a sense of unease after recent attacks on Russian soil, the Guardian writes in its editorial. Meanwhile, Russia is also becoming a cultural wasteland, writes William Fear. Ukraine needs more time before its counteroffensive Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine needs more time before it can launch its much-anticipated counteroffensive against Russia, Luke Harding reported, adding that some armoured vehicles promised by the west have yet to arrive. The president said newly formed brigades were ready to attack. “We can go forward and be successful. But we’d lose a lot of people. I think that’s unacceptable. So we need to wait. We still need a bit more time.” Zelenskiy’s comments in an interview with several media outlets including the BBC are the clearest sign yet that a major Ukrainian military push is unlikely to take place in the next few weeks. The Czech president, Petr Pavel, a decorated retired general who was previously Nato’s principal military adviser, privately warned Ukraine’s leadership against the disaster of a rushed counteroffensive, Daniel Boffey reported this week. Meanwhile, Peter Beaumont travelled to Kherson, where villages are preparing for the counteroffensive. UK will send long-range Storm Shadow missiles to Ukraine Britain has become the first western country to provide Ukraine with the long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles that Kyiv wants to boost its chances in the counteroffensive, prompting a threat from the Kremlin of a military response. Dan Sabbagh and Luke Harding reported this story. Hours after Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he needed more western weapons to be confident of a victory this summer, Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, told MPs that the missiles – which cost more than £2m each – were “now going in, or are in the country itself”. The gift of the missiles was supported by the US, Wallace added, although previously Washington had declined to give Ukraine long-range missiles of its own, fearing that the outcome could escalate hostilities in the 15-month war. Zaporizhzhia plant facing ‘catastrophic’ staff shortage Russia plans to relocate about 2,700 Ukrainian staff from Europe’s largest nuclear plant, Ukraine’s atomic energy company has claimed, warning of a potential “catastrophic lack of qualified personnel” at the Zaporizhzhia facility in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine. Workers who signed employment contracts with Russia’s nuclear agency Rosatom following Moscow’s capture of the Zaporizhzhia plant early in the war are set to be taken to Russia along with their families, Energoatom said in a Telegram post on Wednesday. Russian forces were also evacuating residents from the area near the plant, with more than 1,600 people, including 660 children, evacuated so far, a Moscow-installed official in the region has said. The head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog warned last weekend that the situation around the plant had become “potentially dangerous”. Ukrainian soldiers struggle with post-traumatic stress Volodomyr Kucherenko’s problems with post-traumatic stress began not with the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, but eight years ago when the war began in the Donbas. In the midst of what was supposed to be a truce, he was resting with his unit, which included his brother-in-law, when they were mortared in the yard of a village house. Injured in the leg during the first strike, his brother-in-law threw himself over Kucherenko to protect him from shrapnel as more rounds came in. The wounds he sustained protecting his comrade would prove fatal. Kucherenko’s experience is far from unique, Peter Beaumont reports. After more than a year of brutal and continuing combat, Ukraine’s wounded – both physically and psychologically – have become an inescapable fact in a horrific war often fought at close quarters under shell fire. French journalist killed in Russian rocket strike in Ukraine A French journalist working for Agence France-Presse was killed in a Russian rocket strike near Bakhmut. Arman Soldin, a 32-year-old video coordinator, died on Monday when a Grad missile landed close to where he was lying, Luke Harding reported. Soldin was with Ukrainian soldiers in the town of Chasiv Yar, six miles (10km) from Bakhmut, where fighting has raged for months. At least 11 journalists, fixers and drivers for media organisations have been killed covering the war in Ukraine, according to the group Reporters Without Borders. Risk of cyber-attack is main Eurovision worry, says BBC The risk of a cyber-attack is the “main worry” for broadcasters staging the Eurovision song contest on behalf of war-torn Ukraine, a BBC executive has said. Experts from the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre have been drafted in to help thwart any attempts by pro-Russian hackers to sabotage the competition’s public vote on Saturday, Josh Halliday reports. Kate Phillips, the BBC’s director of unscripted programmes, said there was no specific intelligence about an attack but that there were “so many contingency plans” in place if it happened. Phillips said the contest would have had high security in any event but the war in Ukraine meant “we have had to up it as much as we possibly can”. Inside Ukraine’s most creative bomb shelter In the early days of February 2022, Kharkiv artist Mykola Kolomiets had no idea of the momentous and deadly events that were coming his way. “No one believed that the war was going to start,” says Kolomiets, sporting an orange woolly hat and an infectious grin, “even though we were warned by the experts. My girlfriend joked that the studio would make the perfect bomb shelter.” You can see why, Charlotte Higgins writes: the studio is a labyrinthine, subterranean series of interconnected rooms. What it lacks in natural light – I spot a single window, taped up against the possibility of shattering glass – it makes up for in colour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/05/putin-has-gambled-away-gas-leverage-says-german-vice-chancellor","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-05T16:11:00Z","webTitle":"Putin has gambled away gas leverage, says German vice-chancellor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/05/putin-has-gambled-away-gas-leverage-says-german-vice-chancellor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/05/putin-has-gambled-away-gas-leverage-says-german-vice-chancellor","fields":{"headline":"Putin has gambled away gas leverage, says German vice-chancellor","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has gambled away his gas leverage over Europe, Germany’s vice-chancellor has claimed as he sounded a note of cautious optimism over his country’s energy supplies during a visit to Norway. Russia’s war in Ukraine had caught Berlin at a vulnerable moment since it was over-reliant on natural gas deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and had failed to build up infrastructure for alternative supply channels, said Robert Habeck, the German deputy head of government and economic minister. “The German problem, or the central European problem, was that half of our eggs were in the basket of Putin,” the Green politician said at a joint press conference with the Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, in Oslo. “And he destroyed them.” At the start of 2023, however, Germany was “one-third done” being able to replace ceased Russian deliveries of gas, oil and coal through other channels, such as speedily built liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and an increase of imports from Norway, now Europe’s largest supplier of gas. Norway’s energy minister, Terje Aasland, announced on Thursday that Oslo would again be able to deliver 122bn cubic metres of natural gas to Europe this year, up 8% from deliveries in 2021. While emphasising that Germany’s energy situation remained “very very tight and complicated”, Habeck sounded a note of optimism. “Right now, I can say the storages in Germany are full, around 90%, we will withstand this winter, and the prices are going down.” With central Europe enjoying a relatively mild winter so far, he said, there was a “fair chance” its storage tanks would not be completely empty at the end of the cold season. Amid shortages of gas and fears of power outages, European neighbours have voiced incredulity with Germany sticking to its plan to phase out nuclear power – a decision made under the conservative chancellor Angela Merkel but massively pushed for by Habeck’s Greens. The minister for economic affairs and climate action again dismissed talk of further U-turns on Germany’s nuclear exit plans. His government’s focus was to scale up renewable electricity from about 46% to 80% by 2030, he said, adding: “I would advise everyone to focus on one plan and not disrupt everything again.” Since gas power plants formerly played a crucial role balancing out fluctuating power production from renewables, Germany will probably have to upgrade its grid and open up new storage options to comply with Habeck’s plan. The Green politician, who has proved fleet-footed in dancing around the ecological party’s old dogmas in his first year in power, suggested in Norway he would continue in a similar vein in 2023. In Oslo, Habeck and his Norwegian counterparts signed two declarations to cooperate more closely in areas including hydrogen production and carbon capture and storage (CCS) – two technologies that have in the past proved controversial with the German Greens’ party base. Habeck said while he had previously shared concerns around the safety of CCS – whereby carbon emissions are trapped in filters and then piped to storage locations underground – Norway’s experience with the technology had proven it was safe and efficient. “Better to put CO2 into the earth than into the air,” he said. CCS is banned in Germany, but the government of the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has recently indicated it would look into putting the use of the technology back on the table. The hydrogen agreement between Oslo and Berlin foresees Norway providing Germany with “blue hydrogen”, which is low-carbon but not zero-emissions like green hydrogen, the latter being produced by using renewable electricity to drive an electrolyser that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. Environmentalists fear scaling up blue hydrogen imports could create new dependencies on fossil fuels. Habeck on Thursday described green hydrogen as “superior”, but added: “The only thing is, you need a sufficient amount of it,” and as long as production was insufficient, blue hydrogen was potentially a superior alternative to natural gas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-russian-rebels-belgorod-attack-raid-anti-putin-militia-latest-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T17:51:52Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Belarus says transfer of nuclear weapons from Russia has begun –  as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-russian-rebels-belgorod-attack-raid-anti-putin-militia-latest-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-russian-rebels-belgorod-attack-raid-anti-putin-militia-latest-news","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Belarus says transfer of nuclear weapons from Russia has begun –  as it happened","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s main news: Russia moved ahead on Thursday with a plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president, claimed that the relocation of some of the weapons from Russia to Belarus had already started, according to reports. Unverified footage appears to show a drone speedboat attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs in the Black Sea on Wednesday. The video appears to show at least one of the drones getting extremely close to the ship, though it remains unclear whether or not any damage was done. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has begun withdrawing its forces from the devastated Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and transferring its positions there to regular Russian troops, according to its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin. Ukraine has secured the release of 106 captured soldiers in a prisoner exchange with Russia on Thursday, according to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff. The soldiers, including eight officers, were reportedly said to have been captured fighting in Bakhmut. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it had summoned the ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and Denmark to protest over what it described as the “complete lack of results” in an investigation to identify who blew up the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year. Ukraine said on Thursday it had shot down all 36 Iranian-made drones launched by Russia in overnight attacks which it claims likely targeted key infrastructure and military facilities. Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after users on social media and reports in the local Tass news agency said emergency services had been called to the building. State-owned Tass initially reported on a fire at the ministry early on Thursday morning, but later reported the ministry saying there was none. Dutch prosecutors have seized a plot of land near Amsterdam that belongs to Vladimir Putin’s former son-in-law, a joint investigation by the Guardian and two other media organisations can reveal. The plot of land in Duivendrecht is owned by Jorrit Faassen, a Dutch businessman who was married to Maria Vorontsova, the Russian president’s elder daughter. An entry in the Dutch land registry shows that the plot of land was seized on 12 May by the national public prosecutor’s office for financial, economic and environmental offences. The agency is responsible for enforcing sanctions compliance. Dutch cadastre documents show that the land plot was seized as part of a criminal investigation. You can read more of this exclusive, by my colleagues Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer, here: America has long asked Ukraine not to use US-provided military equipment to carry out attacks inside Russian territory, Gen Mark Milley, the top US general, said on Thursday. Milley, who is chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said his office was looking into imagery appearing to show vehicles allegedly used in an attack around the Russian border region of Belgorod. But he said the US position against such US equipment being used inside Russia was clear to Kyiv, Reuters reports. During talks held this week in Kyiv, Ukraine’s defence minister personally thanked Ben Wallace for the UK’s continued military support for Ukraine, the Ministry of Defence has said. The UK defence secretary met his counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, during a visit to the Ukrainian capital, after the UK provided Ukraine with long-range precision strike capability earlier this month. British sources have said giving Storm Shadow missiles was compatible with the UK’s signature to the voluntary missile technology control regime, which is intended to limit the proliferation of cruise missiles. Wallace said in comments released on Thursday: I was pleased to visit Kyiv again to meet with my good friend Oleksii Reznikov to discuss the next stages of Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s illegal invasion. The UK continues to offer equipment, training and advice to Ukraine’s armed forces. I also visited some of the military commanders who have been so bravely pushing back Russian forces. Russia’s defence ministry said on Thursday that it had scrambled fighter jets to escort two US strategic bomber planes away from the Russian border as they flew over the Baltic Sea, Reuters reports. “The crew of the Russian fighter aircraft identified the aerial targets as two US air force B-1B strategic bombers,” it said in a statement. The US aircraft did not cross the border and the fighter jets returned to their home airfield, it added. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. Ukraine said on Thursday that it would open more embassies in Africa, as it announced its intention to stage a historic summit with leaders from the continent. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, made the comments in a statement to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (now the African Union). He said: We have recently adopted our first African strategy and intensified our political dialogue with many countries on the continent. This year, we are going to establish new embassies in different parts of the continent and plan to hold the first Ukraine-Africa Summit. I invite the leaders of your countries to take part in this important event. In a lower section, the address read: “We are hearing calls for peace from various countries and leaders. We support them as such and think they need to be directed first and foremost to Russia as the country that started this war.” Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president, confirmed on Thursday that the relocation of some tactical nuclear weapons from Russia to Belarus had already started, the Russian state-owned news agency Tass reports. Russia signed a deal with its close ally Belarus earlier on Thursday about the storage of the warheads at a special facility that should be finished in just over a month’s time. It is unclear at this stage how many nuclear weapons would be kept in Belarus. Tactical nuclear weapons are intended to destroy enemy troops and weapons on the battlefield, and have a relatively short range. Speaking in Moscow, Lukashenko said “the movement of the nuclear weapons has begun,” AP reports, but he was not clear whether any actually had arrived in his country. Lukashenko, who sparked rumours of being seriously ill when he cut short a Victory Day appearance in Red Square on 9 May before resurfacing in public on 15 May, was attending a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council with Vladimir Putin and the leaders of Armenia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plan for the nuclear deployment, Moscow’s first outside Russia’s borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, was announced by Putin in an interview with state television on 25 March. The Russian president has said the west is fighting an escalating proxy war against Russia. The US government believes Russia has about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, which include bombs that can be carried by aircraft, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery rounds, AP reports. The Danish foreign ministry has confirmed that its ambassador had been summoned by Russia over the Nord Stream investigation (See 12:34), and said authorities in Denmark, Germany and Sweden were continuing their investigations, Reuters reports. “Denmark has been providing ongoing updates to Russia regarding the investigation’s progress and responding to their inquiries. We will continue to do so,” the ministry said in an email. Unverified footage appears to show a drone speedboat attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs in the Black Sea on Wednesday. The video appears to show at least one of the drones getting extremely close to the ship, though it remains unclear whether or not any damage was done. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and Denmark to protest over what it said was the “complete lack of results” of an investigation into blasts that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year. The head of the Russian private military contractor Wagner has claimed his forces have started pulling out of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine and handing over control to the Russian military. Ukrainian forces still have a foothold in the south-western outskirts, Hanna Maliar, the deputy minister of defence, said. Russia and Belarus signed a deal formalising the procedure for deploying Russian nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, AP reported. Control of the weapons will remain with Moscow. Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after reports claimed that emergency services had been called to the building. Russian forces carried out overnight drone attacks on Kyiv, officials said on Thursday, continuing a month-long campaign of air strikes against the Ukrainian capital. The European Commission has repeated calls for China to play a constructive role in establishing peace in Ukraine, Reuters reports. “The EU expects China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, to play a constructive role (...) and to recall the necessity to respect the principles of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity (...) by unconditionally withdrawing all forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders,” the EU said in a statement on Thursday. Last week, Li Hui, China’s special representative for Eurasian Affairs and former ambassador to Russia, visited Ukraine and met Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a European tour that Beijing billed as its effort to promote peace talks and a political settlement. He is set to visit Russia on Friday. Finland will provide Ukraine with additional military aid worth around €109m, with the package containing ammunition and anti-aircraft weapons, Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential office, has been quoted by the Kyiv Post as saying. Finland is also among the European countries helping Ukraine defend itself on the battlefield, sending Leopard tanks to assist in combat. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinisto, for the military package, which he says is “urgently needed on the battlefield”. Zelenskiy tweeted: I thank Finland and President @niinisto personally for the prompt implementation of our agreements reached in Helsinki. The 16th package of defense assistance to Ukraine, which will include anti-aircraft systems and ammunition, is urgently needed on the battlefield. Together to victory! Anton Gerashchenko, a former minister and adviser to Ukraine’s interior minitry, has shared an unverified clip that purports to show a drone attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs yesterday. Russia claimed on Wednesday it had repelled three unmanned vessels that attempted to strike the reconnaissance ship in the Black Sea, but the video appears to show that at least one of the drones got extremely close to the ship, even though it remains unclear if any damage was caused. On Wednesday, the Russian ministry of defence issued this statement: Today at 05:30am, the Ukrainian armed forces made an unsuccessful attempt to attack the Ivan Khurs ship of the Black Sea fleet with three unmanned speedboats. [The Ivan Khurs] is performing tasks to ensure the safety of the operation of the Turkish Stream and Blue Stream gas pipelines in the exclusive economic zone of the Republic of Turkey. All enemy boats were destroyed by fire from the standard armament of a Russian ship 140km north-east of the Bosphorus. The ship Ivan Khurs of the Black Sea fleet continues to fulfil its tasks. The chair of Ukraine’s parliament has offered words of reconciliation over second world war-era mass murders that have strained relations with its neighbour and strategic ally Poland for 80 years. Ruslan Stefanchuk told Polish lawmakers that the two countries should work together to identify and honour Polish victims buried in Ukraine, sounding a new tone in contrast to the recent angry reaction of Ukraine’s ambassador to Polish expectations of an apology. About 100,000 Poles were massacred in 1943-44 by Ukrainian nationalists and others in Volhynia and other regions that were then in eastern Poland, under Nazi German occupation, and which are now part of Ukraine. “Human life has equal value, regardless of nationality, race, sex or religion,” Stefanchuk told Polish lawmakers. “With this awareness we will cooperate with you, dear Polish friends, and we will accept the truth regardless of how uncompromising it may be.” Poland this year is marking the 80th anniversary of the 1943-44 massacre. Entire villages were burned down and all their inhabitants killed by the nationalists. Poland calls the events a genocide. An estimated 15,000 Ukrainians died in retaliation. Associated Press reports Stefanchuk thanked the families of the victims for cultivating a memory that “does not call for revenge or hatred, but which serves as a warning that nothing like that can ever happen between our nations again”. He said identification and honoring of the victims “without bans or barriers” is “our joint moral and Christian obligation.” Poland’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Łukasz Jasina, had last week said that on the 80th anniversary Poland was expecting an apology from Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Ukraine’s ambassador to Poland, Vasyl Zvarych, reacted by saying that any suggestions of what Kyiv or Zelenskiy should do were “unacceptable and unfortunate”. Here are some of the latest pictures from Bakhmut. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian private military contractor Wagner, claimed on Thursday that his forces had started pulling out of the city. Ukraine, which denies that Bakhmut has fallen to Russia, insisted it still controlled a “micro district” of the devastated city and said it was still advancing on the flanks, AFP reports. There has been an update on the reports of the alleged detention of two Ukrainian saboteurs who were plotting to blow up power pylons of nuclear power stations in Russia (See 06:56am): The Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said the saboteurs working for Ukrainian foreign intelligence had laid explosives on 11 pylons of the Leningrad and Kalinin nuclear power stations. “The plan of the Ukrainian special services was to prompt the shutdown of the nuclear reactors, disrupt the operation of the nuclear power plants and cause serious economic and reputation damage to the Russian Federation,” the FSB said in a statement. The attacks were due to take place on the eve of the 9 May anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany, added the FSB, which said the saboteurs had been recruited in 2022 by Ukraine’s foreign intelligence service. These claims could not be independently verified. The Leningrad station, located on the Gulf of Finland close to St Petersburg, is Russia’s biggest atomic power plant. The Kalinin nuclear power station is 350km north of Moscow. Ukraine has secured the release of 106 captured soldiers in a prisoner exchange with Russia on Thursday, according to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff. The soldiers, including eight officers, were captured fighting in the devastated eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut that Russia says it has captured, but where Kyiv’s forces claim they still have a small foothold, Reuters reports. “Every one of them is a hero of our state. Many of the ones we are returning from captivity were considered missing. The relatives of these people have gone through a difficult time,” said Andriy Yermak, the senior official. There was no immediate information available about the forces Russia received from Ukraine in exchange. Here is some more reporting on the exchange from The Kyiv Independent: Russia’s foreign ministry said on Thursday it had summoned the ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and Denmark to protest over what it said was the “complete lack of results” of an investigation into blasts that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September last year. In a statement, the ministry accused all three countries of trying to conceal who was behind the blasts, adding that it was unhappy about what it called the opaque nature of the investigation and its refusal to engage with Russia. According to a UN report, the three underwater explosions that ruptured the gas link between Russia and Germany north-east and south-east of the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm on 26 September 2022 were equivalent to the power of several hundred kilograms of explosives. The destruction of three of the four Nord Stream pipelines, which had stopped transporting gas at the point of the blasts, has been the subject of intense speculation. The blasts occurred in the economic zones of Sweden and Denmark and both countries have said the explosions were deliberate, but have yet to determine who was responsible. The two countries and Germany have been investigating the incident. Japan scrambled jet fighters after spotting Russian military planes over the Pacific Ocean and Sea of Japan on Thursday, the defence ministry said. It detected one Russian information-gathering aircraft IL-20 flying round-trip from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Pacific and another IL-20 flying toward the waters near Sado Island before turning toward the continent, Reuters quotes the ministry as saying. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. The EU agreed on Thursday to suspend restrictions on imports from Ukraine for a further year after warding off an import ban on grain imposed by some EU nations, Reuters reports. The Council of the EU, the grouping of EU governments, said in a tweet that EU ministers responsible for trade had agreed to the extension at a meeting on Thursday. The EU lifted tariffs and other restrictions for an initial 12 months in June 2022. In reaction to the news, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged for the “temporary liberalisation” to become permanent, as he continues to seek EU accession for Ukraine. He tweeted: As we move towards the EU, this temporary liberalization should become permanent – without any exceptions or restrictions. I am grateful to all EU members for their support, which brings us closer to the EU accession. Last month, EU governments agreed to extend the suspension of duties and quotas on imports from Ukraine by a year to help its economy during the war with Russia. Ukraine gained EU candidacy status in 2022 at record speed, but while it was an initial step to membership, the process usually takes many years to complete. In addition to Russia announcing on Thursday that five Swedish diplomats are to be expelled from the country (See 09:46), Moscow has additionally announced its decision to close its consulate in Gothenburg, Sweden, in September, Reuters reports. We reported earlier (See 10:27) that Russia is said to have replaced Wagner private military units with regular troops in the outskirts of Bakhmut, the Ukrainian mining city that has been largely devastated by a year of deadly fighting. Reuters has new quotes from Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, who had an update after reports of Wagner forces withdrawing from the eastern Ukrainian city and handing over their positions to regular Russian troops. Maliar wrote in comments on the Telegram app: “In Bakhmut’s outskirts, the enemy has replaced Wagner units with regular army forces. Inside the city itself Wagner fighters remain.” She also said that Ukrainian forces still have a foothold in the south-western outskirts of the city. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern military command, claimed that the number of Russian attacks in the area had fallen in the last three days, and that there had been two military engagements in the last 24 hours, though shelling continued. You can read more on the fighting raging in Bakhmut here: Unverified footage of drones being shot down over Kyiv last night has been posted by Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine. He tweeted: Another sleepless night for many of us. Another attack on Kyiv. We hold on, go to work in the morning, thankful to our air defense and all our friends who keep Ukraine in their hearts and bring our Victory closer. Russia unleashed a barrage of drones against Kyiv in its 12th nighttime air assault on the Ukrainian capital this month, but the city’s air defences shot all of them down, Ukrainian authorities claimed on Thursday.

Russia has replaced its Wagner private military units with regular soldiers in the outskirts of Bakhmut but the group’s fighters remain inside the devastated city, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Thursday. Her comments appeared at least partially to confirm an announcement by Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin that his group had started withdrawing its forces from Bakhmut in east Ukraine and handing over its positions to regular Russian troops. Prigozhin had repeatedly threatened to withdraw troops from the area before it was taken, citing his dispute with the Russian military and defence establishment over supplies of ammunitions. A couple of days ago Prigozhin sarcastically suggested that his mercenary troops could be replaced by “a battalion of generals”. Yesterday he warned of a new revolution in Russia if leaders did not improve their handling of the war. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak sought to downplay the idea that there was a counter-offensive coming from Ukraine that would be marked by a single significant shift of gear. He wrote: “Once again about the counter-offensive. This is not a ‘single event’ that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon. These are dozens of different actions to destroy the Russian occupation forces in different directions, which have already been taking place yesterday, are taking place today and will continue tomorrow.” Ukraine’s defence ministry claimed to have shot down 36 out of 36 Shahad drones launched into Ukraine by Russia overnight. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that some areas of Chernivtsi were left without power after lines were damaged by falling drone debris. The Russian-imposed head of Crimea’s administration said on Thursday that air defences had downed six drones overnight in different areas of the region. There were no casualties. Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia’s defence minister has said Belarus remains a “faithful ally and reliable partner” to Russia in the face of western states doing “everything possible … to prolong and escalate the armed conflict in Ukraine” as the two countries signed an agreement on the positioning of nuclear weapons in Belarus. During a visit to Minsk Sergei Shoigu said “deploying nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus does not transfer it to the republic control over it, and the decision on its use remains with Moscow”. Overnight the New York Times has reported that US intelligence officials believe that Ukraine was responsible for the drone attack which slightly damaged the Kremlin, and which Russia labelled an assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin, despite the Russian president not being in the building at the time. Kremlin spokesperson Dimitry Peskov said Russia had always held Kyiv responsible, and that it didn’t really matter exactly which Ukrainian units were behind it. Podolyak on Thursday responded by saying Ukraine had nothing to do with the “strange and pointless” attack. The US ambassador to Ukraine has criticised Russia over its implementation of the newly extended Black Sea grain initiative. Bridget Brink tweeted: “After repeated threats to withdraw from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, Russia now refuses to allow any of the waiting 28 ships into Pivdennyi, one of the three ports designated by the agreement for food exports – a clear violation of their commitment. Russia must stop obstructing the operations of this life-saving initiative.” Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after users on social media and reports in the local Tass news agency said emergency services had been called to the building. State-owned Tass initially reported on a fire at the ministry early on Thursday morning, but later reported the ministry saying there was none. Earlier today Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak sought to downplay the idea that there was a counteroffensive coming from Ukraine that would mark a significant shift of gear. He tweeted: Once again about the counteroffensive. Without further questions. 1. This is not a “single event” that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon. 2. These are dozens of different actions to destroy the #Russian occupation forces in different directions, which have already been taking place yesterday, are taking place today and will continue tomorrow. 3. Intensive destruction of enemy logistics is also a counteroffensive. However, as my colleague Dan Sabbagh, our defence and security editor, notes: “Except, at some point, Ukrainian ground forces will need to attack with sufficient combat mass …” Russia has replaced its Wagner private military units with regular soldiers in the outskirts of Bakhmut but the group’s fighters remain inside the devastated city, deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Thursday. Her comments appeared at least partially to confirm an announcement by Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin that his group had started withdrawing its forces from Bakhmut in east Ukraine and handing over its positions to regular Russian troops. Yesterday, Julian Borger reported for the Guardian from Kyiv that Progozhin had said that 20,000 of its fighters have been killed in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. He also warned that Russia could face another revolution if its leadership does not improve its handling of the war. Prigozhin pointed to the social disparity underlined by the war, with the sons of the poor being sent back from the front in zinc coffins while the children of the elite “shook their arses” in the sun. “This divide can end as in 1917 with a revolution,” he said in an interview posted on his channel on the Telegram messaging app. “First the soldiers will stand up, and after that – their loved ones will rise up. There are already tens of thousands of them – relatives of those killed. And there will probably be hundreds of thousands – we cannot avoid that.” Reuters reports Russian prosecutors have asked a court to recognise crimes committed by Nazi Germany in the Moscow region during the second world war as a genocide against the peoples of the Soviet Union. Russia said on Thursday it would expel five Swedish diplomats in what it said was a retaliatory measure for Sweden’s “confrontational course” in relations with Russia. The Russian foreign ministry said it was responding to the expulsion of five of its diplomatic staff from Sweden last month, which it called an “openly hostile step”. Relations between the two countries have worsened since Sweden last year announced its intention to join Nato after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Reuters reports the Russian statement said ties had “reached an unprecedented low”. A senior Ukrainian presidential aide said on Thursday that Ukraine had nothing to do with a “strange and pointless” drone attack on the Kremlin and played down the findings of two US media reports. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, told Reuters in a statement that Russia was trying to reduce arms supplies to Kyiv by playing on western fears of a possible escalation because of alleged Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil. The New York Times reported that assessments by US spy agencies showed that a drone attack on the Kremlin this month was probably orchestrated by one of Ukraine’s special military or intelligence units. Moscow blames the attack on Ukraine. The US ambassador to Ukraine has criticised Russia over its implementation of the newly extended Black Sea grain initiative. Bridget Brinktweeted: After repeated threats to withdraw from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, Russia now refuses to allow any of the waiting 28 ships into Pivdennyi, one of the three ports designated by the agreement for food exports – a clear violation of their commitment. Russia must stop obstructing the operations of this life-saving initiative. Russia’s defence minister has said Belarus remains a “faithful ally and reliable partner” to Russia in the face of western states doing “everything possible … to prolong and escalate the armed conflict in Ukraine”. Russia launched part of its full-scale invasion and failed attempt to capture Kyiv from Belarusian soil in February 2022, in what it termed a “special military operation”. In statements published on Telegram by Russia’s ministry of defence, Sergei Shoigu is quoted as saying his meetings with his Belarusian counterpart have become more regular, saying: This is especially important in the context of the rapid growth of tension, the destruction of the foundations of strategic stability and the unprecedented intensification of international confrontation. Everything possible is being done to prolong and escalate the armed conflict in Ukraine, which is receiving all kinds of military support. The Republic of Belarus has been and remains our faithful ally and reliable partner. Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson has said of reports in the New York Times that Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin that “it doesn’t make much difference which of the units of the Kyiv regime is behind it”. Reuters reports Dmitry Peskov told the media: “We immediately said that the Kyiv regime was behind this.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, denied at the time that Ukraine was responsible. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Tass has more detail on the document signed today concerning arrangements for Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons. On Telegram it quotes Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu saying “deploying nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus does not transfer it to the republic control over it, and the decision on its use remains with Moscow”. It also reports Shoigu noted the measures implemented by Russia and Belarus “comply with all existing international legal obligations”. Tass writes: Russian president Vladimir Putin said on 25 March that Russia, at the request of the Belarusian side, would deploy its tactical nuclear weapons in the republic, as the US has long done on the territory of its allies. According to the head of the Russian state, on 1 July it is planned to complete the construction of a storage facility for tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. Moscow has already handed over to Minsk the Iskander missile system, which can be a carrier of nuclear weapons, and has assisted in re-equipping Belarusian aircraft to be able to use special ammunition. Belarusian servicemen have undergone appropriate training in the Russian Federation. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has started withdrawing its forces from the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, its founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said in a video published on Thursday, Reuters reports. Prigozhin had repeatedly threatened to withdraw troops from the area before it was taken, citing his dispute with the Russian military and defence establishment over supplies of ammunitions. A couple of days ago Prigozhin sarcastically suggested that his mercenary troops could be replaced by “a battalion of generals”. The defence ministers of Russia and Belarus on Thursday signed a document on the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported. Separately, citing Russian media, Reuters reported that the Russia defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the west was waging an “undeclared war” against Russia and Belarus. Shoigu is in Minsk for a meeting of the Council of Ministers of Defense of the CSTO member states, which include Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Russia and Belarus, which are close allies over the conflict in Ukraine, agreed earlier this year to deploy part of Moscow’s tactical nuclear arsenal in Belarus. Russia launched its failed attempt to capture Kyiv from Belarusian territory last year. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, offers this update on the overnight situation, writing on its official Telegram channel: At night, air defence forces destroyed 36 of the 36 ‘Shahed’ drones that Russia launched over Ukraine, the air force reported. Also at night, the Russian military struck Tsyrkuny in the Kharkiv region. The S-300 missile hit the ground. A private house was damaged, there were no injuries. In the Chernivtsi region, two power lines were damaged as a result of the fall of the drone debris – part of the Dnipro district was cut off. Three residential buildings were damaged. Yesterday, the Russian army shelled the Kherson region 83 times: four people were injured. The claims have not been independently verified. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, one of the occupied regions of the Donbas which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed, has posted to Telegram to state that in the last 24 hours one person has been killed and six injured by Russian shelling in the region. He listed a number of locations where houses and infrastructure had been destroyed, including Horlivka, Chasiv Yar and Kostiantynivka. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian-imposed head of Crimea’s administration said on Thursday that air defences had downed six drones overnight in different areas of the region. There were no casualties, Reuters reports Sergei Aksyonov said on Telegram. Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Overnight the New York Times has reported that US intelligence officials believe that Ukraine was responsible for the drone attack which slightly damaged the Kremlin, and which Russia labelled an assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin, despite the Russian president not being in the building at the time. It writes: US officials said the drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month was likely orchestrated by one of Ukraine’s special military or intelligence units, the latest in a series of covert actions against Russian targets that have unnerved the Biden administration. US intelligence agencies do not know which unit carried out the attack and it was unclear whether President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine or his top officials were aware of the operation. The New York Times goes on to say: US officials say their level of confidence that the Ukrainian government directly authorised the Kremlin drone attack is “low” but that is because intelligence agencies do not yet have specific evidence identifying which government officials, Ukrainian units or operatives were involved. The attack appeared to be part of a series of operations that have made officials in the US – Ukraine’s biggest supplier of military equipment – uncomfortable. The Biden administration is concerned about the risk that Russia will blame US officials and retaliate by expanding the war beyond Ukraine. American spy agencies see an emerging picture of a loose confederation of Ukrainian units able to conduct limited operations inside and outside Russia, either by using their own personnel or partners working under their direction. Some of these missions could have been conducted with little, if any, oversight from Zelenskiy, officials said. At the time, Zelenskiy said “We didn’t attack Putin or Moscow”, as he addressed journalists during a visit to Helsinki. Russia’s FSB security service says it has detained two Ukrainian saboteurs who were plotting to blow up power pylons of nuclear power stations in Russia, Reuters reports, citing Russian state-owned news agency RIA. More on that story now: Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, which says Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped ignite a boom in clean energy investment,said: “Clean energy is moving fast – faster than many people realise. This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels. “In very simple, but very striking terms, five years ago global energy investment was $2tn, of which $1tn was for clean energy and $1tn was for fossil fuels. Today, $1tn is for fossil fuels and $1.7tn is for clean energy. This is a dramatic shift which will have consequences for the energy markets and climate change. In my view, it’s very exciting.” The clean energy boom is particularly apparent in solar power investment, Birol said. “For the first time in history the amount of investment going to solar is higher than the amount going to oil production. It may be symbolic but it is very important because it shows the tide turning,” he said. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped ignite a boom in clean energy investment which will significantly outpace spending on fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. A report from the IEA has found that clean energy investment is on track to reach $1.7tn (£1.4tn) this year as investors turn to renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, storage and other low-carbon technologies. Investment in coal, gas and oil will rise to just over $1tn, the IEA said. The Paris-based agency found that clean energy investments have been boosted by many factors including periods of strong economic growth and volatile fossil fuel prices as well as heightened concerns about energy security after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: A second fire, which appeared to be unrelated, broke out at a market in Akos, in the Moscow region on Wednesday evening. Russia’s emergency services said on Telegram that the fire had increased from 500 sq metres to 1,800 sq metres and had been localised. No victims were reported. Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after users on social media and reports in the local Tass news agency said emergency services had been called to the building. Tass initially reported on a fire at the ministry early on Thursday morning, saying: “The fire broke out in the building of the Ministry of Defense of Russia in the centre of Moscow.” They cited an unnamed government source and said “a fire broke out on one of the balconies.” Emergency services were on the scene, the source told Tass. Almost an hour later, the news agency published a second story saying: “The Ministry of Emergency Situations did not detect a fire in the building of the Ministry of Defense in Moscow, the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Russian Federation for Moscow told reporters on Thursday.” Both stories were still up on the website at 5am Thursday, Moscow time. Unverified video circulated on social media early on Thursday showing smoke emerging from the ministry building. In one video of the building seen by CNN, a woman could be heard saying: “The smell of burning is horrible.” Denis Kapustin, Russian commander of a militia that conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week was asked repeatedly about Western media reports that his militia had used US military equipment that was meant to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s invasion, but declined to answer directly. “I know exactly where I got my weapons from. Unfortunately not from the Western partners”, he said. Washington is looking into reports that American vehicles were used by Ukraine inside Russia, the White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. He said the US has been clear with Kyiv that it does not support any such use of US-made equipment. The Russian commander of a militia that conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week said on Wednesday his group would soon launch more incursions into Russian territory. Denis Kapustin, who described himself as the commander of the Russian Volunteer Corps, spoke to reporters on the Ukrainian side of the border with Russia a day after Moscow said it had repelled the raid on the Belgorod region. Kyiv has said the attack was carried out by Russian citizens, casting it as homegrown, internal Russian strife. Two groups operating in Ukraine – the Russian Volunteer Corps and Freedom of Russia Legion - have claimed responsibility. “I think you will see us again on that side,” said Kapustin, who introduced himself by his call-sign White Rex. “I cannot reveal those upcoming things, I cannot even reveal the direction. The ... border is pretty long. Yet again there will be a spot where things will get hot.” Russian forces carried out overnight drone attacks on Kyiv, officials said Thursday, continuing a month-long campaign of air strikes against the Ukrainian capital. Via AFP: Military chiefs said Kyiv’s air defences destroyed all of the drones during the three-hour air attack, the twelfth this month. Serhiy Popko, head of the city’s military administration, said in a message on Telegram that Russia “again attacked Kyiv from the air”. “The attack was massive,” the statement added. “The enemy continues to use attack tactics in several waves, with intervals between groups of attacking drones.” He added that “all detected air targets moving in the direction of Kyiv were destroyed” by Ukrainian air defence systems. The attacks were carried out using Iranian-made Shahed drones, the statement added, citing preliminary information. Air alerts were also reported in the cities of Kharkiv and Chernivtsi. Welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Our top stories this morning: The Russian commander of a militia that conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week said on Wednesday his group would soon launch more incursions into Russian territory. And Russian forces carried out overnight drone attacks on Kyiv, officials said Thursday, continuing a month-long campaign of airstrikes against the Ukrainian capital. Military chiefs said Kyiv’s air defences destroyed all of the drones during the three-hour air attack, the twelfth this month. Here are the other key developments: Washington is looking into reports that American vehicles were used by Ukraine inside Russia, the White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. He said the US has been clear with Kyiv that it does not support any such use of US-made equipment. The Kremlin said the use of US-made military hardware by pro-Ukraine fighters who conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week was testament to the West’s growing involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The Russian military said on Tuesday it had routed militants who attacked the Russian border region of Belgorod with armoured vehicles the previous day, killing more than 70 “Ukrainian nationalists” and pushing the remainder back into Ukraine. In Belgorod, nine people remain in hospital, utility supplies continue to be disrupted, and more than 500 people remain displaced after the cross-border incursion by anti-Russian partisans on Monday, according to Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Russian region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Iranians on Wednesday to reconsider the supply of deadly drones to Russia. Iranian-made Shahed drones supplied to Moscow have played a major role in Russia’s attacks on cities and infrastructure. “The simple question is this: what is your interest in being an accomplice to Russian terror?” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. “What is the benefit to Iran of such cynical killing?” Ukraine will not be able to join Nato as long as the war is going on, the alliance’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Wednesday. “I think that everyone realised that, to become a member in the midst of a war, is not on the agenda,” Reuters reports he said at an event organised by the German Marshall Fund of the US in Brussels. “The issue is what happens when the war ends.” The Russian private army Wagner lost 20,000 fighters in the drawn-out battle for Bakhmut, according to the group’s chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin. He said about 20% of the 50,000 Russian prisoners recruited to fight in the 15-month war had died in the eastern Ukrainian city, and a similar number of its regular troop. The figure was in stark contrast with claims from Moscow that it has lost just over 6,000 troops in the war, and is higher than the official estimate of the Soviet losses in the Afghanistan war of 15,000 troops between 1979 and 1989. The World Health Organization assembly passed a motion on Wednesday condemning Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, including attacks on healthcare facilities. The motion passed by 80 votes to nine, with 52 abstentions and 36 countries absent, Reuters reported. The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development expects to spend €1.5bn (£1.3bn) in Ukraine next year in support of infrastructure and the economy, a senior source at the bank has said. It comes on top of €3bn already projected for 2022 and the remainder of 2023. The funds have helped the economy continue to function and ensure that there was no run on banks and that civil servants continued to be paid. The European Union has discussed sending Ukraine the profits from €196.6bn of Russian assets that are stuck inside the plumbing of global financial markets, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service, has accused Washington and London of thwarting efforts to reach a settlement over the conflict in Ukraine and of turning a blind eye to what he said was increasing “terrorism and violence” visited on civilians by Ukraine. The first of three Russian hypersonic missile scientists to be arrested on suspicion of treason will go on trial next week, the court handling the case said on Wednesday. The criminal case against Anatoly Maslov, 76, will open in St Petersburg’s city court on 1 June, the court said on its website. The Netherlands wants to give Ukrainian pilots F-16 training as soon as possible, the Dutch defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, said on Wednesday in a letter to parliament. The training would be coordinated with Belgium, Denmark and the United Kingdom, and other countries could join, Ollongren added. Russia has announced that a court in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don will try five foreign men, including three British nationals, accused of fighting alongside Ukrainian forces against Moscow. The trial will begin on 31 May on terrorism-linked allegations and other charges. The men are believed to face trial in absentia. Ukraine’s main Orthodox church said on Wednesday it had decided to switch to a calendar in which Christmas is celebrated on 25 December, a move that distances it from Russia. Ukrainian Christians, a majority of whom are Orthodox, have traditionally celebrated Christmas on 7 January alongside other predominantly Orthodox Christian countries. Germany will buy 18 Leopard 2 tanks and 12 self-propelled howitzers to replenish stocks depleted by deliveries to Ukraine, a member of the parliamentary budget committee that approved the purchase on Wednesday told Reuters. The tanks order will come to €525.6m (£457m) while the howitzers have a price tag of €190.7m; all of them are to be delivered by 2026 at the latest, said the finance ministry documents meant for the parliament."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/28/russia-ukraine-war-russia-strikes-towns-near-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-mayor-says-ukraine-targets-bridges-to-kherson-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-28T19:23:47Z","webTitle":"Reports EU set to suspend visa travel agreement with Russia – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/28/russia-ukraine-war-russia-strikes-towns-near-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-mayor-says-ukraine-targets-bridges-to-kherson-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/28/russia-ukraine-war-russia-strikes-towns-near-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-mayor-says-ukraine-targets-bridges-to-kherson-live","fields":{"headline":"Reports EU set to suspend visa travel agreement with Russia – as it happened","bodyText":"The EU is set to suspend its visa travel agreement with Russia this week, The Financial Times reports. The plan to freeze a 2007 deal will make it harder and more expensive for Russians to get Schengen-area documents, the FT reports. It comes after some eastern member states threatened to unilaterally close their borders to Russian tourists, with other countries calling for collective action to stop ordinary Russians from travelling to the EU on tourist visas. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has previously called for a complete ban.` Russia claims it has hit workshops at the Motor Sich factory in the Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine. The facility is where helicopters for the Ukrainian air force are being repaired, the defence ministry said. But Ukrainian officials later said the hit resulted significant civilian damages: damaging nine multi-story buildings and 40 private homes. A Russian missile has struck military infrastructure in Rivne oblast in northern Ukraine. Reports so far are that there were no casualties, and that the missiles came from just over the border from Belarus. The United States today called out Russia’s “cynical obstructionism” after Moscow remained the sole holdout in blocking the adoption of a joint declaration on nuclear non-proliferation following lengthy international negotiations at the United Nations. The 191 signatories review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty every five years, which aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and promote cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. But on Friday, Russia prevented the declaration’s adoption, saying it took issue with “political” aspects of the text. It is unclear if Russia will try to fill its increase in armed forces members by recruiting more volunteer “contract” soldiers or by lifting annual targets for conscriptions, British intelligence says. President Vladimir Putin signed a decree this week to increase the size of the armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million in the wake of the country’s invasion of Ukraine, now in its sixth month. The latest UK Ministry of Defence briefing says that under the Russian legislation now in place, the decree is unlikely to make “substantive progress” towards increasing Russia’s combat power. Two people were killed in Russian firing on Bakhmut, the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Saturday. The eastern city is a significant target for Russian and separatist forces seeking to take control of the parts of Donetsk they don’t hold. Associated Press also reported local government officials as saying that in the Black Sea region of Mykolaiv, one person was killed and another wounded in Russian firing. On the opposite shore from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the towns of Nikopol and Marhanets were hit by shells on Saturday afternoon and evening, Nikopol’s mayor, Yevhen Yevtushenko, said on Telegram. Concern persists about the potential for a radiation leak at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s state energy operator has warned there are “risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances” at the Russian-occupied plant. Authorities were distributing iodine tablets to residents who live near the plant in case of radiation exposure. Russia and Ukraine traded fresh accusations of each other shelling the area around the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, on Saturday. Moscow’s troops have “repeatedly shelled” the site of the plant over the past day, the Ukrainian state nuclear company, Energoatom, said. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed Ukraine’s troops “shelled the territory of the station three times” in the past day. The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, is trying to negotiate access to the plant for an urgent inspection mission “to help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there”. Energoatom head Petro Kotin told the Guardian a visit could come before the end of the month, but the Ukrainian energy minister, Lana Zerkal, told a local radio station she was not convinced Russia was negotiating in good faith. Volodymyr Zelenskiy met today with representatives of his defence and security sector, his office said. The secret meeting was attended by the heads of the armed forces, intelligence agencies, the ministry of defence, the ministry of internal affairs, the Ukrainian security service as well as other defence forces. They discussed the situation at the front and the needs of the Ukrainian forces. The United States today called out Russia’s “cynical obstructionism” after Moscow remained the sole holdout in blocking the adoption of a joint declaration on nuclear non-proliferation following lengthy international negotiations at the United Nations. The 191 signatories review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty every five years, which aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and promote cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. But on Friday, Russia prevented the declaration’s adoption, saying it took issue with “political” aspects of the text. Vedant Patel, a deputy spokesman for the US state department, said in a statement that Moscow did this “in order to block language that merely acknowledged the grave radiological risk at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant” – the largest nuclear reactor in Europe that is currently occupied by the Russian military. The latest draft text had expressed “grave concern” over military activities around Ukrainian power plants, including Zaporizhzhia, according to Agence France-Presse. Kyiv and Moscow have repeatedly accused the other of shelling the plant, and its operator has warned of the risks of a radioactive leak. “For the Russian Federation to not accept such language in the face of overwhelming international consensus underscores the need for the United States and others to continue urging Russia to end its military activity near ZNPP and return control of the plant to Ukraine,” Patel said. A Russian missile has struck military infrastructure in Rivne oblast in northern Ukraine. Reports so far are that there were no casualties, and that the missiles came from just over the border from Belarus. Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk oblast, said explosions were heard at an agricultural facility in Russian-occupied Svatove. This facility was used as a Russian military base. Russia claimed that its forces struck workshops at the Motor Sich factory in the Zaporizhzhia region last night, damaging a facility where helicopters for the Ukrainian air force were being repaired. Ukrainian officials said the strike caused much more civilian damage than the Russians would acknowledge. With energy prices continuing to skyrocket across Europe, the Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, today called on the EU to separate electricity prices from those of gas to keep them from rising further due to the war in Ukraine, saying “we can’t let Putin decide every day” the price of energy, Agence France-Presse is reporting. “Electricity prices must go down,” he said in a statement. “We have to stop this madness that is happening right now on energy markets.” Nehammer said he would raise the issue at an emergency meeting the bloc is due to hold on the issue. He said he has already discussed it with the leaders of Germany and the Czech Republic, which currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency. Last week, the year-ahead contract for German electricity reached €995 ($995) a MWh while the French equivalent surged past €1,100 – more than a tenfold increase in both countries from last year. In the UK, the Ofcom energy regulator said it would increase the electricity and gas price cap almost twofold from 1 October to an average of £3,549 a year. It is just after 6pm in Ukraine. Here is what you might have missed: The EU is set to suspend its visa travel agreement with Russia this week, The Financial Times reports. The plan to freeze a 2007 deal will make it harder and more expensive for Russians to get Schengen-area documents, the FT reports.

Dell Technologies says it has ceased all Russian operations after closing its offices in mid-August, the latest in a growing list of western firms to exit Russia. Reuters reports that the US computer firm – a key supplier of servers in Russia – has joined others in curtailing operations since Moscow’s February invasion of Ukraine. Dell suspended sales in Ukraine and Russia in February, saying it would monitor the situation to determine next steps. Concern persists about the potential for a radiation leak at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s state energy operator has warned there are “risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances” at the Russian-occupied plant. Authorities were distributing iodine tablets to residents who live near the plant in case of radiation exposure. Russia and Ukraine traded fresh accusations of each other shelling the area around the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, on Saturday. Moscow’s troops have “repeatedly shelled” the site of the plant over the past day, the Ukrainian state nuclear company, Energoatom, said. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed Ukraine’s troops “shelled the territory of the station three times” in the past day. The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, is trying to negotiate access to the plant for an urgent inspection mission “to help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there”. Energoatom head Petro Kotin told the Guardian a visit could come before the end of the month, but the Ukrainian energy minister, Lana Zerkal, told a local radio station she was not convinced Russia was negotiating in good faith. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has issued a statement marking Ukraine’s Aviation Day, in which he pledged that Kyiv’s troops would “destroy the occupiers’ potential step by step”. The Ukrainian president vowed that the Russian “invaders will die like dew on the sun”. Russia has probably increased the intensity of its attacks in the Donetsk area of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region over the past five days, according to British intelligence. Pro-Russia separatists have most likely made progress towards the centre of Pisky village, near Donetsk airport, but Russian forces overall have secured few territorial gains, the latest report from the UK Ministry of Defence says. Russia has blocked an agreement at the UN aimed at bolstering the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The failure to agree to a joint statement, due to Moscow’s objection to a clause about control over the Zaporizhzhia plant, is the latest blow to hopes of maintaining an arms control regime and keeping a lid on a rekindled arms race. Ukrainian sailors will be allowed to leave the country for work, Ukraine’s cabinet of ministers has said. The prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said men of draft age employed as crew members would be allowed to leave the country so long as they had permission from their local conscription offices to cross the border. Britain’s defence ministry has said it is giving six underwater drones to Ukraine to help clear its coastline of mines and make grain shipments safer. In addition, dozens of Ukrainian navy personnel will be taught to use the drones over the coming months, the ministry said. Kazakhstan, a neighbour and ally of Russia, has suspended all arms exports for a year, its government said, amid the conflict in Ukraine and western sanctions against Moscow. Poland and the Czech Republic have agreed to protect the airspace of their Nato ally Slovakia, as it upgrades its air force from legacy Soviet-made MiG-29 fighters to a new batch of F-16 jets from the US. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that Russian forces had turned the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant into a military military base, putting the whole continent at risk. He said on Twitter: For decades, nuclear safety has remained Ukraine’s top priority, especially given our tragic past. Russian invaders turned Zaporizhzhya NPP into a military base putting the entire continent at risk. Russian military must get out of the plant – they have nothing to do there! Russia and Ukraine have each traded accusations of each other shelling the area around the nuclear plant. As we reported earlier, Russia’s defence ministry claimed there was more Ukrainian shelling of the plant over the past two days. However, Ukrainian authorities said that Russian artillery fired at Ukrainian towns across the river from the power plant overnight. Regional governor Oleksandr Starukh said on Telegram on Sunday that Russian forces struck residential buildings in the region’s main city of Zaporizhzhia, about a two-hour drive from the plant, and the town of Orikhiv further east, Reuters reports. Emma Graham-Harrison reports for us from Chernihiv: The woods outside Chernihiv were quiet in late August when Anatoliy Pavelko scrambled into a 10-metre bomb crater with a trowel and an icebox full of sample jars. He wanted to find out what the Russian FAB-250 bomb left behind when it carved this gaping hole into the ground in the spring. Four months earlier, the environmental lawyer was dug in on a frontline just a few kilometres away, shells crashing around him in the bitter fight to keep Russian forces out of Kyiv. Now he has taken temporary leave from his unit of volunteers and returned to Chernihiv for a more familiar battle on a different front in the war against Moscow. Russia’s invasion has killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians and destroyed homes and entire cities. It is also devastating Ukraine’s environment, an “ecocide” that activists worry is going largely unrecorded amid the broader national tragedy.

Will his friends in the west rescue him? “The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. So wrote American author Henry David Thoreau in 1854. It’s a fate that is rapidly overtaking Vladimir Putin as he struggles to escape the disastrous trap he set for himself in Ukraine. Russia’s president keeps understandably schtum about his “special military operation”. But indefinite stalemate is not what he expected. He didn’t expect car bombs in Moscow and humiliating attacks on fortress Crimea, either. Least of all did Putin anticipate 80,000 Russian soldiers dead or wounded. Dying with them is his Peter the Great pipe dream of a “greater Russia”. Extinct already is his reputation as anything other than a killer and a crook. An endless military quagmire is not a scenario Putin can afford as slow-burn western sanctions corrode his economy and his military’s manpower and materiel are steadily depleted. So what are his options? Read more here: Putin is trapped and desperate. Will his friends in the west rescue him? These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. The Financial Times is reporting that the EU is set to suspend its visa travel agreement with Russia this week. The plan to freeze the 2007 deal will make it harder and more expensive for Russians to get Schengen-area documents, the FT reports. It comes after some eastern member states threatened to unilaterally close their borders to Russian tourists, with other countries calling for collective action to stop ordinary Russians from travelling to the EU on tourist visas. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has previously called for a complete ban. The FT reports: As a first step, ministers plan to give political support to suspending the EU-Russia visa facilitation agreement at a two-day meeting in Prague that begins on Tuesday, three officials involved in the talks told the Financial Times. A senior EU official involved in the talks said: It is inappropriate for Russian tourists to stroll in our cities, on our marinas. We have to send a signal to the Russian population that this war is not OK, it is not acceptable. Parts of the 2007 deal relating to free movement of government officials and businessmen were suspended in late February. A wider suspension would remove preferential treatment for Russians when applying for all EU visas, requiring more documents, making them more expensive and significantly increasing waiting times. The senior EU official added that deeper changes could be introduced by the end of the year: We are in an exceptional situation and it requires exceptional steps. We want to go beyond suspending the visa facilitation. Russia claims it has hit workshops at the Motor Sich factory in the Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine. The facility is where helicopters for the Ukrainian air force are being repaired, the defence ministry said. In an update on the conflict, Russia’s defence ministry said: The high-precision weapons of the Russian Aerospace Forces in the city of Zaporozhye, on the territory of the Motor Sich plant, hit the production shops, in which the helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force were repaired. They also claimed that Ukrainian forces have been shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant over the past two days. As we reported earlier, Ukraine and Russia continue to accuse each other of shelling near Europe’s largest nuclear facility in what has become a dangerous flashpoint in the war amid concerns about the potential for a radiation leak. Isobel Koshiw reports for us from Kyiv: Ukrainians are likely to experience the coldest winter in decades, its gas chief has said, as the thermostats on its Soviet-era centralised heating systems are set to be switched on later and turned down. Yurii Vitrenko, the head of the state gas company Naftogaz, said indoor temperatures would be set at between 17 and 18C, about four degrees lower than normal, and he advised people to stock up on blankets and warm clothes for when outdoor temperatures fall to and beyond the -10C winter average. “Heating season”, the period when the central heating is on, will come later and end earlier, said Vitrenko. The target depends on Ukraine’s international allies giving it the necessary funds to import 4bn cubic metres-worth of gas, as well as no wildcards playing out – such as Russia destroying gas infrastructure or further decreasing its gas supplies to Europe.

This is what you might have missed: It is unclear if Russia will try to fill its increase in armed forces members by recruiting more volunteer “contract” soldiers or by lifting annual targets for conscriptions, British intelligence says. President Vladimir Putin signed a decree this week to increase the size of the armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million in the wake of the country’s invasion of Ukraine, now in its sixth month. The latest UK Ministry of Defence briefing says that under the Russian legislation now in place, the decree is unlikely to make “substantive progress” towards increasing Russia’s combat power. Two people were killed in Russian firing on Bakhmut, the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Saturday. The eastern city is a significant target for Russian and separatist forces seeking to take control of the parts of Donetsk they don’t hold. Associated Press also reported local government officials as saying that in the Black Sea region of Mykolaiv, one person was killed and another wounded in Russian firing. On the opposite shore from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the towns of Nikopol and Marhanets were hit by shells on Saturday afternoon and evening, Nikopol’s mayor, Yevhen Yevtushenko, said on Telegram. Dell Technologies says it has ceased all Russian operations after closing its offices in mid-August, the latest in a growing list of western firms to exit Russia.

Around 46,750 Russian soldiers have been killed in the war with Ukraine, the country’s foreign ministry said on in an update posted on Twitter. The update added that Russia has also lost 3,171 vehicles and fuel tanks, 234 aircraft and 1,942 tanks, since the start of the conflict in February this year. Russia does not give a running total of troop losses or equipment destroyed or taken. The Ukrainian claims could not be independently verified. Rustem Umerov, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, thanked the UK for supplying the country with underwater drones. A press release on Saturday from the Ministry of Defence said: Six autonomous minehunting vehicles will be sent to the country to help detect Russian mines in the waters off its coast. Three of these will be provided from UK stocks, with a further three to be purchased from industry. The lightweight autonomous vehicle is designed for use in shallow coastal environments, operating effectively at depths of up to 100m to detect, locate and identify mines using an array of sensors so the Ukrainian Navy can destroy them. Dozens of Ukrainian Navy personnel will be taught to use the drones over the coming months, with the first tranche having already begun their training. Dan Sabbagh reports for us from Kramatorsk: A Russian missile slammed into Valentina’s garden on a residential street in Kramatorsk at about 6pm on a warm August evening, landing among the squash and cabbages to the rear of the pensioner’s house, smashing windows, destroying the roof, scattering glass, tiles, bricks and rubble everywhere. Valentina, 75, was sitting outside under a grapevine, just about far enough from the blast to escape only with cuts and bruises, some all too visible on a visit to her ruined home five days later. But while the wounds will heal, the trauma will linger. “All my life I worked hard. Why? Why? What did I do?” Valentina cried as she surveyed the wreckage, with no apparent prospect of help with the necessary clear-up, too shocked to know what to do next. Perhaps it was time to relocate to relative safety elsewhere in Ukraine? “How can I go? I have nothing to go with,” she asked. Read more: ‘We were born here’: Ukrainians in frontline towns face painful choice The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree allowing Ukrainian passport holders who have entered Russia since Moscow’s offensive to live and work in the country indefinitely. Until now, Ukrainians could stay in Russia only for a maximum of 90 days within a 180-day period. To stay longer or to work, special authorisation or a work permit was required. Agence France-Presse reports that the new measure allows Ukrainian citizens and people from Ukraine’s separatist eastern regions that Russia recognises as independent to work in Russia without a work permit and to live in the country “without a time limit”, according to the temporary decree published on Saturday. The decree also forbids the deportation of Ukrainian citizens, except for those released from prison or those deemed to pose a threat to Russia’s security. Dell Technologies says it has ceased all Russian operations after closing its offices in mid-August, the latest in a growing list of western firms to exit Russia. Reuters reports that the US computer firm – a key supplier of servers in Russia – has joined others in curtailing operations since Moscow’s February invasion of Ukraine. Dell suspended sales in Ukraine and Russia in February, saying it would monitor the situation to determine next steps. Dell spokesperson Mike Siemienas said on Saturday: In mid-August, we closed our offices and ceased all Russian operations. Russia’s industry ministry said on Friday that many of the researchers and engineers working for Dell in Russia had already been offered new jobs, after media reports saying the company was making a full exit. Miranda Bryant and Mark Townsend report: A “shocking” 50,000 Ukrainian refugees in the UK could be made homeless next year, the government has been warned, but ministers are refusing to offer a fresh package of support to offset the impending crisis. As the cost of living crisis bites and with no end in sight to the war with Russia, fears are mounting that the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme will unravel next month when refugees’ initial six-month placements with hosts end without alternative accommodation in place. Although Boris Johnson has framed the UK’s response to Russia’s invasion as a principled triumph, a number of organisations warn that a key response of his government to the conflict’s refugee crisis could prompt a “disastrous rise in homelessness”. Read more: 50,000 Ukrainian refugees in UK facing homelessness ‘disaster’ next year On the opposite shore from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the towns of Nikopol and Marhanets were hit by shells on Saturday afternoon and evening, Nikopol’s mayor, Yevhen Yevtushenko, said on Telegram. ‘Welcome to the refugee lifestyle,’ says Eno Enyieokpon, a fashion designer who is re-establishing his brand, Enno, in Budapest having left everything behind in Kyiv. Identifying as a black Ukrainian, Eno says most of the ideas that have changed his life as a designer have come from tough times in Ukraine. As he waits to bring his machines from Kyiv, and works on new shows while navigating the unfamiliar Hungarian system, he is optimistic about the future, telling other Ukrainian refugees: ‘If we had the will to withstand the Russians we also have the willpower to move and forge ahead in life.’ Russia has lost “tens of thousands” of troops and it is not yet clear how they will seek to recruit more soldiers, the latest British intelligence update said. The latest UK Ministry of Defence briefing said that President Vladimir Putin signed a decree this week to increase the size of the armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million in the wake of the country’s invasion of Ukraine, now in its sixth month. The briefing said that under the Russian legislation now in place, the decree is unlikely to make “substantive progress” towards increasing Russia’s combat power. This is because Russia has lost tens of thousands of troops; very few new contract servicemen are being recruited; and conscripts are technically not obliged to serve outside of Russian territory. However it “remains unclear” how Russia will try to fill its increase in armed forces members, said the MoD. It could recruit more volunteer “contract” soldiers or lift annual targets for conscriptions, the update added. Two people were killed in Russian firing on Bakhmut, the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Saturday. The eastern city is a significant target for Russian and separatist forces seeking to take control of the parts of Donetsk they don’t hold. Associated Press also reported local government officials as saying that in the Black Sea region of Mykolaiv, one person was killed and another wounded in Russian firing. We have not been able to independently verify these battlefield reports. Millions of tonnes of food from past harvests in Ukraine still need to be cleared to make room in silos for the next one, the United Nations coordinator for the grains agreement says. More than 1m tonnes of grains and other foods have been exported under the grains deal brokered by Turkey and the UN, Reuters reports. Amir Abdulla, the UN coordinator for the Black Sea grain initiative, said on Saturday that the deal “has started creating some space but much more grain needs to shift to make space for the new harvest”. Ukrainian and Russian forces continue to accuse each other of shelling near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, with Ukraine saying Russian forces fired on areas just across the river from the complex and Russia saying Ukrainian shells hit a building where nuclear fuel is stored. The claims on Saturday came amid continuing concerns about the potential for a radiation leak at Europe’s largest nuclear facility, Associated Press reports. The governor of Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, Valentyn Reznichenko, said Russian Grad missiles and artillery shells hit the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, each 10km (six miles) across the Dnieper River from the plant in south-eastern Ukraine. A Russian defence ministry spokesperson, Igor Konashenkov, said Ukrainian forces had fired on the plant from Marhanets. Seventeen Ukrainian shells hit the plant over the past day, he said, with four striking the roof of a building that stored nuclear fuel. Concern persists about the potential for a radiation leak at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s state energy operator has warned there are “risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances” at the Russian-occupied plant.

The hugely expensive and dangerous legacy of the UK’s 20th-century nuclear revolution amounts to 700,000 cubic metres of toxic waste – roughly the volume of 6,000 doubledecker buses. Much of it is stored at Sellafield in Cumbria, which the Office for Nuclear Regulation says is one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear sites in the world. As yet, there is nowhere to safely and permanently deposit this waste. Nearly 50 years ago the solution of a deep geological disposal facility (GDF) was put forward, but decades later the UK is no nearer to building one. Experts say new nuclear facilities will only add to the problem of what to do with radioactive waste from nuclear energy and that the “back end” issue of the hazardous toxic waste from the technology must not be hidden. An assessment by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) says spent fuel from new nuclear reactors will be of such high temperatures it would need to stay on site for 140 years before it could be removed to a GDF, if one is ever built in the UK. The prime minister’s nuclear ambition, it is understood, rests with even more modern nuclear reactors, known as advanced modular reactors. But nuclear waste experts say no one knows how to deal with the waste from such reactors, because they are such a new technology. “It is essential to talk about the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle when you are considering building new nuclear power stations,” said Claire Corkhill, a professor of nuclear material degradation at the University of Sheffield and a member of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, an independent body that advises the government. “Whilst we have a plan to finally and safely deal with the waste, it is less certain how this will be applied to the modern nuclear reactors that the government are planning to roll out. “These are completely different to previous reactors and we are at a very early stage of understanding how to deal with the waste. In my personal view, I do not think we should be building any new nuclear reactors until we have a geological disposal facility available.” The cost of decommissioning and disposing of the radioactive waste from nuclear power stations built in the 1950s, 1970s and 1990s has risen to £131bn, according to the latest NDA annual report. This is likely to rise further as the costs of building a deep geological disposal site rise to up to £53bn. Attempts to build an underground dump for nuclear waste have so far failed. Nine years ago an attempt to site one in Cumbria was rejected. A new attempt to find a site is in its early stages. Three sites in Cumbria and one in Lincolnshire are being examined. If it goes ahead, it could be years before building starts, and the GDF would only be available to receive waste from the late 2040s. “The amount of legacy waste is not small in terms of nuclear waste,” said Corkhill. “It is expensive to deal with. These materials are hazardous and we are looking at an underground footprint of some 20km at a depth of 200 metres to 1,000 metres. So regarding new nuclear sites, we need to think about whether it is possible to build a GDF big enough for all the legacy waste and the new nuclear waste.” The power stations that need decommissioning include 11 Magnox power stations built between the 1950s and 1970s, including Dungeness A in Kent, Hinkley Point A in Somerset and Trawsfynydd in north Wales, and seven advanced gas-cooled reactors built in the 1990s, including Dungeness B, which closed last year, Hinkley Point B and Heysham 1 and 2 in Lancashire. Waste from more recent nuclear facilities including Sizewell B, a pressurised water reactor in Suffolk, and two new EDF pressurised water reactors – Hinkley C, which is under construction in Somerset, and Sizewell C, which is planned for construction in Suffolk – will also need to be deposited in a GDF. It is likely to take until 2150 to deposit the legacy waste into a GDF, if one is built. Only then would a GDF be able to take waste from new nuclear reactors. Steve Thomas, a professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, said: “Despite 65 years of using nuclear power in Britain, we are still, at best, decades away from having facilities to safely dispose of the waste. Until we know this can be done, it is premature to embark on a major new programme of nuclear power plants.” NDA documents show that as of 2019, the volume of nuclear waste that needs to be permanently disposed of in a deep GDF is 773,000 cubic metres. Of that waste, 10% is from new nuclear facilities, while the rest is legacy waste. A government spokesperson said: “This is not an either/or situation. As the prime minister has said, nuclear will be a key part of our upcoming energy security strategy alongside renewables. We are committed to scaling up our nuclear electricity generation capacity, and building more nuclear power here in the UK, as seen through the construction of Hinkley Point C – the first new nuclear power station in a generation. “Alongside this we’re developing a GDF to support the decommissioning of the UK’s older nuclear facilities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-256-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-06T01:10:22Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 256 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-256-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-256-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 256 of the invasion","bodyText":"Russian troops have been looting Kherson ahead of a potential withdrawal from the south-eastern Ukrainian city. Items taken range from art and cultural exhibits to ambulances and tractors. There has been an assassination attempt on a judge who sentenced two Britons to death in Russian-controlled Ukraine. Alexander Nikulin, who said Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner should be shot by a firing squad, was shot in Vuhlehirsk, in Donetsk, on Friday night. The local supreme court justice is in a serious condition in hospital. Russian troops are allegedly searching for residents in the Kherson region who are refusing to evacuate, before the forces’ potential withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnieper River. The Ukrainian foreign ministry has claimed its forces killed another 600 Russian soldiers in the past 24 hours. Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, has said the country did supply Russia with drones but that it took place before President Vladimir Putin’s forces invaded Kyiv. The drones have been used in attacks on civilian infrastructure, notably targeting power stations and dams. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dismissed talk of limited Iranian supplies to Russia, saying Kyiv had downed 11 drones on Friday alone. He said: “If Iran continues to lie about the obvious, it means the world will make even more efforts to investigate the terrorist cooperation between the Russian and Iranian regimes and what Russia pays Iran for such cooperation.” Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, said Iran “should realise that the consequences of complicity in the crimes of Russian aggression against Ukraine will be much larger than the benefits of Russia’s support”. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant two days after it was disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged high voltage lines, the UN nuclear watchdog said. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said he does not believe Russia will use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. The 300,000 troops Putin conscripted as part of the mobilisation drive are providing “little additional offensive combat capability” as the Russian military is struggling to train them, UK’s Ministry of Defence has reported. Scheduled power cuts will take place on Sunday in seven Ukrainian provinces including major cities such as Kyiv. Other provinces affected are Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy and Poltava. About 500 power generators have been sent to Ukraine by 17 EU countries to help with the energy problems caused by Russian attacks. At least 112,000 Russians have emigrated to Georgia this year, border crossing statistics show. Reuters reported that the first large wave of 43,000 arrived after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February and the second wave came after Putin announced a nationwide mobilisation drive in late September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/25/russia-to-raise-ukraine-dirty-bomb-claim-at-un-security-council","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-25T21:35:18Z","webTitle":"Russia steps up Ukraine ‘dirty bomb’ claim in letter delivered to UN","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/25/russia-to-raise-ukraine-dirty-bomb-claim-at-un-security-council","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/25/russia-to-raise-ukraine-dirty-bomb-claim-at-un-security-council","fields":{"headline":"Russia steps up Ukraine ‘dirty bomb’ claim in letter delivered to UN","bodyText":"Russia has stepped up its nuclear propaganda and delivered a letter to the United Nations claiming that Ukraine is preparing to detonate a “dirty bomb” on its territory, an allegation dismissed by Kyiv, western governments and weapons experts as absurd and an attempt at distraction or pretext for Moscow’s own escalation. The letter was addressed to the UN secretary general and the Gabonese ambassador, who currently holds the rotating presidency of the security council, and follows calls by Russia’s defence minister to foreign ministers in recent days making similar unfounded allegations. At the same time, Russia circulated a 310-page document in the security council, repeating earlier debunked claims that Ukraine and its western backers had been working on a bioweapon. Asked about the Russian claims on Tuesday, US president Joe Biden said: “I spent a lot of time today talking about that.” The letter was delivered at a time when Russia is still suffering battlefield losses in Ukraine and anxious to reverse the momentum. Nato has entered its second week of annual drills rehearsing for nuclear war, and Russia is expected to launch its own annual exercises this week. The Russian UN letter presented no evidence for Moscow’s claim that Ukraine was preparing to detonate a dirty bomb, an explosive device designed to disperse radioactive materials over an area to render it at least temporarily uninhabitable. Instead, it lists all the possible sources of radioactive isotopes to which Ukraine could conceivably have access, but makes several mistakes, suggesting whoever drafted the letter had no grasp of the science involved, experts said. Ukraine’s uranium mines are listed as one possible source for material for a dirty bomb, but natural uranium ore would be useless for such a purpose. “You can’t make a dirty bomb with uranium ore. It’s a bunch of rock that contains tiny inclusions of uranium 99% of which only a tiny bit is radioactive. Only long-term sustained exposure can result in harm to humans,” said Mariana Budjeryn, a senior research associate at the project on managing the atom at the Harvard Kennedy school’s Belfer Center. Other sources of radioactive material the letter mentioned were spent fuel at the Chornobyl nuclear plant, but that has been cooling for decades and would not do much harm. Other sites it listed with potentially more toxic material are sealed and monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), so any diversion would be spotted and flagged. The letter also claimed Kyiv intended the bomb to be a false-flag operation, in which the Ukrainians would claim it was a Russian low-yield nuclear weapon containing highly enriched uranium, which would be detected in the atmosphere. But the traces left by a dirty bomb would be completely different from a real nuclear weapon, which would leave behind products of nuclear fission. “There is no world in which dispersed spent nuclear fuel or some kind of radioactive material from research facilities could be mistaken for, or misrepresented as, byproducts of a nuclear fission reaction,” Budjeryn said. “It is just elementary physics.” The Russian letter also pointed to another “heinous scenario” supposedly plotted by Kyiv, to sabotage a nuclear power plant under its control or shell the Zaporizhzhia plant under Russian occupation. But again it offered no evidence why Ukraine would carry out an act of such significant self-harm. The flimsiness of the claims led some diplomats and experts to suspect it was not intended to convince anyone but to send a message, but it is unclear what that message may be. One possibility is that it is meant to look like a cover for Russia’s own plans to use such a device in the latest of a long series of efforts to deter Ukraine’s backers from continuing their support. Another option is that it is simply a distraction from Russia’s continuing military setbacks in Ukraine, intended principally for domestic consumption. “I guess because they need something to sell to Russian media when they are pushed out of Kherson,” one western diplomat at the UN suggested. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Russia’s accusation was a sign that Moscow – which has threatened to use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine – was planning such an attack and preparing to shift the blame to Ukraine. In Washington on Tuesday Biden said: “Russia would be making an incredible, serious mistake if it were to use a tactical nuclear weapon.” Asked about the Russian dirty bomb claims, he replied: “I’m not guaranteeing that it’s a false flag operation yet. Don’t know, but it would be a serious mistake, a very serious mistake.” The Kyiv government has asked the IAEA to verify that no radioactive materials in Ukraine have gone missing, and the UN nuclear watchdog said it was preparing to send inspectors to two unidentified Ukrainian sites, both already subject to frequent inspections. At the same time, the Ukrainian nuclear power authority, Energoatom, reported that Russian occupying forces were carrying out secret construction work within the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Energoatom said it believed the Russians “are preparing a terrorist act using nuclear materials and radioactive waste” stored at the plant compound. The Russian allegations come amid reports suggesting Russian forces and Wagner mercenaries had suffered heavy losses in recent days in fighting in the key Donbas city of Bakhmut, which has been the focus of four months of ferocious Russian efforts to advance there with little to show for the effort. The flurry of Russian accusations has been met with deep scepticism in the west with analysts pointing to Moscow’s history of false allegations – including its characterisation of Ukraine as a “neo-Nazi” regime – to justify its own aggression. France, Britain and the US said the allegations were “transparently false” and Washington warned Russia there would be “severe consequences” if Russia used any nuclear material, while saying there were no signs of that yet. “There would be consequences for Russia whether it uses a dirty bomb or a nuclear bomb,” said the state department spokesperson, Ned Price. Perhaps significantly, the Russian allegation has prompted rare communication with the west, with Moscow’s armed forces chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, speaking on Monday to his US counterpart, Mark Milley, for the first time since May. Early on Tuesday, Ukraine’s army chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said he too had spoken to Milley. Most analysts believe there is little chance a false-flag dirty bomb attack could really be used as a pretext for a nuclear detonation. “If this was a false-flag event, we would know it instantly, nobody would blame Ukraine,” said William Alberque, an arms control expert at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Radiological weapons are so identifiable, so scrutinised. You can make a chemical weapon from scratch,” but “nuclear material has a fingerprint” based on the facilities used to create it, he told AFP."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jul/10/queensland-lnp-pledges-net-zero-2050-target-at-next-election-amid-deeply-troubling-rise-in-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-10T05:42:05Z","webTitle":"Queensland LNP pledges net zero 2050 target at next election amid ‘deeply troubling’ rise in emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/10/queensland-lnp-pledges-net-zero-2050-target-at-next-election-amid-deeply-troubling-rise-in-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jul/10/queensland-lnp-pledges-net-zero-2050-target-at-next-election-amid-deeply-troubling-rise-in-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Queensland LNP pledges net zero 2050 target at next election amid ‘deeply troubling’ rise in emissions","bodyText":"Queensland’s opposition has announced it will bring a net zero emissions target by 2050 to the next state election at the LNP’s annual convention in Brisbane over the weekend. LNP leader David Crisafulli said it was “deeply troubling” that emissions had increased in Queensland over the past several years. He told reporters on Sunday the “debate has moved on” and that the party would start considering how emissions reductions could be achieved. “The question now is how do we do it? How do we do it to make ourselves have energy that is affordable, reliable and sustainable? How do we make sure that we don’t just talk about targets that we actually achieve energy reduction?” The announcement drew immediate criticism from environmentalists and the Queensland Greens who argued the target did not go far enough. “Our emissions targets should be based on the science, not political manoeuvring,” Dave Copeman, director of the Queensland Conservation Council, said. “I hope the next LNP emissions reduction policy is in line with climate science necessary to keep warming to 1.5 degrees.” Copeman welcomed the LNP’s support of Labor’s policy on coal royalties but criticised the party’s consideration of nuclear power at the annual conference. “Regrettably senior LNP leaders continuing to raise the distraction of nuclear power, suggests they are still looking for soundbites, not science-based solutions,” he said. “Solar, wind and storage are the proven technology that provides cheaper, cleaner power … If we continue the climate wars, we risk missing out of the investment and future-proof jobs that the renewables transformation will create.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning South Brisbane MP Amy MacMahon tweeted that the Palaszczuk government and Queensland opposition now have the same net zero target by 2050. “It’s not science-based. And on our current trajectory, we’re not going to meet even this,” she said on Sunday. The Palaszczuk government last year accused the LNP of “crab walking” towards climate action and attempting to “cobble something together” in the lead-up to the federal election. In New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, the Liberals have backed a target to reach net zero emissions by 2050. In Western Australia, the Liberals have promised zero emissions by 2030. While the federal Liberals support a target of net zero emissions by 2045. The Queensland state government took their net zero emissions target by 2050 to the state election in 2020, alongside its existing 2030 target to cut emissions from 2005 levels by 30%. In response, the LNP said it would scrap both the interim target and the net zero target by 2050 and instead align the state to the federal government’s targets. The Coalition did not have a net zero target at the time but had committed to an emissions reduction of 26–28% below 2005 levels by 2030. “Unlike Labor who have promised change to only go backwards, the LNP will work with the private sector, energy market institutions, households and businesses as we transition towards a sustainable energy future,” Crisafulli said when he was the environment spokesperson. “To increase the amount of renewable energy, the LNP will fast-track approvals for major projects, including renewable energy projects to reduce power bills and create more green jobs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/22/germany-chancellor-visits-canada-russian-gas-energy-olaf-scholz","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T21:38:25Z","webTitle":"German chancellor says he is working fast to find alternatives to Russian gas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/22/germany-chancellor-visits-canada-russian-gas-energy-olaf-scholz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/22/germany-chancellor-visits-canada-russian-gas-energy-olaf-scholz","fields":{"headline":"German chancellor says he is working fast to find alternatives to Russian gas","bodyText":"The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said he is working as fast as he can to extricate Germany from its dependence on Russian gas and pursue new energy supplies, as pressure mounts on his government to come up with solutions to tackle a looming crisis. On the first day of a three-day visit to Montreal, Scholz met Canada’s prime minster, Justin Trudeau, on Monday. “Canada plays a really, really central role for the development of green hydrogen,” Scholz said. “That’s why we are very glad to be able to expand our cooperation in this area on this occasion too.” The two leaders are set to sign a deal for Canada to supply clean hydrogen to Germany, but Trudeau downplayed the likelihood of a separate agreement on direct exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), due to logistical constraints and costs. “There are a number of potential projects that are in the books for which there has never been a strong business case,” Trudeau said. “It needs to make sense for Germany to import LNG from the east coast.” Scholz thanked Canada for allowing the export – despite sanctions on Moscow – of a refurbished turbine that Russia said it needed to continue providing natural gas to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The fact Russia has yet to request the needed turbine, which is currently in Germany, showed the Russian claims about technical issues hampering gas supplies to Russia were a ruse, he said. “Russia is no longer a reliable business partner,” Scholz said. “It has reduced gas deliveries everywhere in Europe, always referring to technical reasons that never existed. And that’s why it’s important not to walk into [Russian president Vladimir] Putin’s trap.” The visit is taking place amid a heated debate in Germany triggered by growing concerns that Russia may completely close down its already considerably reduced gas flows to the country. The government faces pressure to prolong the life of Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations, which are due to go offline by the end of the year as part of a withdrawal strategy announced in 2011. In recent days there have even been calls for it to reinstate the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, which was mothballed by the German government as a reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Scholz said at the weekend a decision on the nuclear power plants would probably be made in the coming days. But Robert Habeck, Germany’s vice-chancellor and economy minister and the leading Green, stressed this would only help to decrease gas consumption by about 2% and said “for the little it would bring us, it’s the wrong decision”. The government has dismissed out of hand the idea of resurrecting the defunct Nord Stream 2 project, repeatedly referring to the idea as “morally reprehensible”. But the fact it has been brought up at all illustrates the extent to which the pressure is growing on Scholz to come up with workable strategies to cope with the unprecedented situation, which threatens to plunge the German economy into recession and leave millions facing soaring energy bills and freezing homes. The deals struck with Canada will do little to help Germany in the near future, with this winter and next expected to be beset by an energy shortage and record prices. The head of the intelligence service has warned of the dangers of unrest from a radicalised minority consisting of rightwing extremists and conspiracy theorists, which he said were planning to exploit the situation. Leading economists have warned that rising energy bills on top of other living cost hikes will push increasing numbers of Germans into poverty and could trigger social unrest. Against this backdrop the government is keen to stress that once the infrastructure is in place to support hydrogen and LNG Germany will be on a safer footing. The optics of Scholz and Habeck landing in Montreal with their delegation are seen as sending an important immediate message to German voters that the government is taking action. In recent months it has often come across as stunned into stasis as it reeled from the shock realisation that Europe’s largest economy had made itself dangerously dependent on a single energy source in its pursuit of a green transition. Ahead of the visit, Habeck said Germany was “staring in the face of a very critical winter”. Habeck told German TV that the rapid filling up of national gas storage facilities – which are currently at just under 80% capacity – was encouraging, but warned that Russia could yet further reduce the flow and there was therefore no room for complacency. At present only about 20% of the levels of gas due via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline are reaching Germany."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/14/penny-wong-hits-back-at-chinas-claim-aukus-nuclear-submarines-will-fuel-an-arms-race","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-14T06:14:32Z","webTitle":"Penny Wong hits back at China’s claim Aukus nuclear submarines will fuel an arms race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/14/penny-wong-hits-back-at-chinas-claim-aukus-nuclear-submarines-will-fuel-an-arms-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/14/penny-wong-hits-back-at-chinas-claim-aukus-nuclear-submarines-will-fuel-an-arms-race","fields":{"headline":"Penny Wong hits back at China’s claim Aukus nuclear submarines will fuel an arms race","bodyText":"The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has hit back at China’s response to Aukus, insisting that its criticisms of the nuclear-powered submarine deal are “not grounded in fact”. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Wong also signalled that she planned to make further visits to south-east Asia and the Pacific to reassure the region that Australia does not seek to escalate military tensions. After the announcement of a multi-decade plan that could cost as much as $368bn between now and the mid-2050s, Wong said no rational observer could conclude Australia was the source of a regional arms race. She urged China to take up a US offer to agree on “guardrails” to avoid an outbreak of war, despite the concept being derided by Beijing last week. Australia has previously accused China of lacking transparency about its own rapid military buildup. “Nobody wants to see escalation. Nobody wants to see a miscalculation,” Wong said on Tuesday. “I think the region is entitled to seek that the great powers manage competition respectfully and appropriately.” Hours after the Aukus plans were announced by the US, the UK and Australia on Tuesday, China’s foreign ministry repeated its longstanding position that the deal reflected “a typical Cold War mentality” that would stimulate an arms race and “sabotage” the international nuclear non-proliferation system. China’s mission to the UN also denounced the “irony” that “two nuclear weapons states who claim to uphold the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard are transferring tons of weapons-grade enriched uranium to a non-nuclear-weapon state”. When asked about that comment, Wong said: “That response is not grounded in fact.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Wong said Australia had been “very clear” that it would not acquire nuclear weapons. She also said “a number of other countries have” nuclear-powered submarines – and they were allowed under the NPT. “Australia’s motivation is peace,” she said. Observers say the Aukus arrangement is novel, because it would be the first time that fissile material and nuclear technology had been transferred from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. But the Australian government is believed to disagree with this being characterised as a “loophole”, and it has promised not to enrich uranium or reprocess spent fuel as part of the program. Wong vowed to continue talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency to put in place “the highest quality arrangement … to ensure this material is managed in a way that is consistent with the NPT”. The UK and the US say they will provide Australia with nuclear material in “complete, welded nuclear power units that will not require refuelling” during the more than 30-year lifetime of the submarines. In a fact sheet issued on Tuesday, the Australian government added: “The nuclear fuel Australia receives cannot be used in nuclear weapons without further chemical processing, requiring facilities that Australia does not have and will not seek.” The government has, however, promised to store the nuclear waste in Australia in a location yet to be decided. In recent weeks, Australian ministers and officials have paved the way for the Aukus announcement in a series of calls and meetings with counterparts across the Indo-Pacific. But ambassadors in Canberra are expected to be briefed in detail over the coming days. Australian officials contacted their counterparts in Beijing on Monday to offer a briefing. Wong said the government had put in place “a comprehensive strategy” leading up to the announcement and made it a priority to re-engage with the Pacific and south-east Asia “in a very focused way”. The Aukus plan would give Australia “a greater capability of contributing to that strategic equilibrium which is necessary for the sort of region we all want to live in”. “Certainly it gives Australia a capability that very few countries have and that comes with responsibilities, which we are very aware of,” Wong said, adding that the plans would not undercut diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions. “Our focus and our attention should be on averting conflict, on keeping the region stable, peaceful and prosperous, and ensuring that sovereignty can be protected.” The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said the best way to reassure the region would be for Australia to sign and ratify the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Indonesia – which joined with Malaysia to raise strong concerns about Aukus after it was first announced in 2021 – responded more cautiously on Tuesday. The Indonesian foreign ministry said it was the responsibility of all countries to maintain peace and stability in the region, and it expected Australia to develop “a verification mechanism that is effective, transparent and non-discriminatory”. On the eve of the announcement, China’s nationalistic Global Times newspaper quoted Chinese analysts as claiming Australia was “planting a time bomb” and would bear the cost of its “expensive mistake”. But the incoming Australian ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, said last week Aukus should be seen in the context of China’s own push to build the world’s largest navy. China currently operates 56 submarines, of which 12 are nuclear-powered, according to the latest Pentagon assessment. Australia plans to buy at least three and as many as five Virginia-class submarines from the US in 2030s. The first Australian-built submarines, based on a yet-to-be-completed British design, should enter into service in the 2040s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-346-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-04T02:22:37Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 346 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-346-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-346-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 346 of the invasion","bodyText":"The United States has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $2.2bn (£1.8bn) which will include precision-guided rockets and Hawk air defence firing units, as well as other munitions and weapons, the US state department said. Significantly, it includes the ground launched small diameter bomb (GLSDB) for the first time, which will double Ukraine’s strike range and allow Ukraine’s military to strike deep behind the frontlines of the war. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine will continue to fight for Bakhmut as long as it can, vowing that “nobody will give away” the eastern “fortress” city. Speaking at a press conference following a summit in Kyiv with European Union leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, Ukraine’s president said the country would be able to begin to liberate occupied Donbas if weapons supplies were “quickened, specifically long-range weapons”. France and Italy have finalised technical talks for the joint delivery of the Samp/T air defence system to Ukraine in spring 2023, the French defence ministry has announced. It comes after Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said on Thursday that the system would be operational in Ukraine “within seven to eight weeks”. The system can track dozens of targets and intercept 10 at once. It is the only European-made system that can intercept ballistic missiles. The EU has promised that a tenth package of sanctions against Russia will be in place by 24 February, the first anniversary of the war. The EC president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the package would cover trade worth €10bn (£8.9bn/$10.8bn) and “hit the trade and technology that supports [Russia’s] war against Ukraine”. The next round of EU sanctions, however, is not expected to include nuclear power, which Hungary has already threatened to block. Air raid sirens twice sounded across Ukraine on Friday as Zelenskiy hosted the EU leaders in Kyiv. The first air alert in Kyiv was on Friday morning. The second, hours later, followed a joint news conference involving Zelenskiy, von der Leyen and Charles Michel. There were no immediate reports of any Russian airstrikes on Kyiv throughout the day. EU member countries have agreed on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products, the Swedish presidency of the EU said. Ambassadors of the 27 EU states agreed at a meeting on Friday to impose a $100-a-barrel cap on premium products such as diesel and a $45 cap on low-end products, according to diplomats. The price cap comes into effect on Sunday, as does the EU’s ban on Russian oil product imports. EU leaders offered strong support for Ukraine but set “no rigid timelines” for its accession to the bloc. Zelenskiy had hoped the EU would put Ukraine on a rapid track to membership, but western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv’s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. “There are no rigid timelines but there are goals that you have to reach,” von der Leyen told the news conference. An American medic has been killed while working on the frontlines in Ukraine, just weeks after arriving in the country. Pete Reed, 34, was killed on Thursday while he was helping evacuate civilians when his vehicle was reportedly hit by a missile in Bakhmut. The EU will launch a humanitarian de-mining programme in Ukraine worth €25m, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has confirmed, saying de-mining was “crucial to save the lives of civilian population”. New tanks supplied by Nato allies will serve as an “iron fist” in a counteroffensive by Kyiv to break through Russian defensive lines, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said. Western supplies of 155-mm artillery would be vital for Ukraine to deter Russian attacks in the south and in the east, Reznikov said at a joint news conference with his Polish counterpart, Mariusz Błaszczak. Germany has approved the export of older Leopard 1 battle tanks, which would add to the raft of fighting vehicles Berlin promised last week. A spokesperson said Olaf Scholz’s government had granted an export licence for the German-made tanks first produced in the 1960s and replaced within Germany’s own military by Leopard 2 tanks in 2003. Ukraine has unveiled a criminal case against Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. Prigozhin has been charged with encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine and of waging a war of aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said Wagner fighters of all ranks would be held responsible, including those who fled abroad."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/31/who-will-fund-sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-when-will-it-be-built-explainer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-31T16:35:02Z","webTitle":"Who will fund Sizewell C nuclear plant and when will it be built? | explainer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/31/who-will-fund-sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-when-will-it-be-built-explainer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/31/who-will-fund-sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-when-will-it-be-built-explainer","fields":{"headline":"Who will fund Sizewell C nuclear plant and when will it be built?","bodyText":"Boris Johnson is poised to sign off as prime minister by giving the green light for a new nuclear reactor costing up to £30bn. The decision to offer funding for the Sizewell C in Suffolk, in his final week in Downing Street, is expected to unlock significant private funding for the project after years bogged down in planning approvals. However, it would come after Johnson promised not to make any major spending decisions before leaving office. Here is the state of play. What is Sizewell C? The power station is planned to sit alongside the existing Sizewell B nuclear reactor on the Suffolk coast. When complete, it is estimated the 3.2 gigawatt plant will be capable of generating electricity for 6m homes for up to 60 years. Sizewell C is expected to plug a gap in Britain’s nuclear capabilities – most UK plants will be shut by 2030. Sizewell B is due to close in 2035, although its lifetime may be extended. How is it going to be funded? The plans were originally developed by France’s EDF, which holds an 80% stake in the project, and the Chinese state-backed nuclear power company CGN, which has a 20% holding. However, ministers are keen to avoid further Chinese involvement in UK nuclear sites amid worsening relations between Britain and China. CGN holds a stake in Hinkley Point C – the delayed and over-budget Somerset plant upon which plans for Sizewell are based. The UK government and EDF are expected to each take a 20% stake, while bankers at Barclays have been tasked by officials with finding investors for the remainder. Pension and infrastructure specialist funds are seen as the most probable candidates to invest. How much will it cost? Estimates have crept up from £20bn to a current range of £20bn to £30bn. The government will make a final decision on how much taxpayer funds will be put in – thought to be around £6bn – next year. Ministers have already committed £100m to the project and plan to use a so-called “regulated asset base” funding model. RAB funding gives investors a set return during the construction phase of a project, reducing their risk to encourage their involvement in vital infrastructure deals. However, it shifts the risk of delays and extra costs on to taxpayers. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has estimated that taxpayer backing will add an extra £1 a month to household bills. However, research by the University of Greenwich business school seen by the Guardian shows the average monthly cost could reach £2.12, or £25.40 a year. The average estimate in the study put the combined cost at £35bn, or £2.3bn a year. When will it be built? The site is a crucial pillar in Johnson’s plan to green-light eight new nuclear reactors over the next eight years. However, the approval process has suffered multiple delays. The progress of Hinkley Point C – which earlier this year pushed back its opening to June 2027, a decade later than planned – has not provided an encouraging blueprint. The University of Greenwich forecasts predict it will take 15 years to build Sizewell C, or 17 years under its gloomiest forecast, and cost £43.8bn. Greg Clark, the levelling up secretary, this week unveiled proposals designed to speed up the approval of nuclear power stations and off-shore windfarms. The fast-track process will also be applied to major roads and airport runways. What are the objections against Sizewell C? The project has faced opposition on several fronts from critics who say nuclear projects are too slow to build and costly, as well as those concerned over safety and nuclear waste. Campaigners question the track record of the pressurised water reactor proposed for the site and the cost to consumers. Opponents also worry whether local infrastructure is capable of handling a site that could bring 6,000 workers to the area and thousands of extra vehicles. The threat to water supplies in an area officially designated as seriously water stressed and risk of coastal erosion and flooding have also been raised. What happens next? A final decision is expected from the government on the project next year. With Johnson’s decision before his departure, the situation has echoes of Hinkley Point C, when Theresa May put the project on hold in 2016 in her first weeks as prime minister amid security concerns. May eventually approved the project and, if Liz Truss is successful in the Tory leadership race, her rumoured chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, is understood to be supportive of Sizewell C. However, the process may also be held up by a legal challenge by the Together Against Sizewell C campaign, over planning consent for the plant, which was given against the advice of the independent Planning Inspectorate in July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/09/ukraine-war-missile-strikes-attacks-hit-kyiv-power-out-odesa-kharkiv","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T17:17:27Z","webTitle":" Russia launches six hypersonic missiles in massive barrage against Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/09/ukraine-war-missile-strikes-attacks-hit-kyiv-power-out-odesa-kharkiv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/09/ukraine-war-missile-strikes-attacks-hit-kyiv-power-out-odesa-kharkiv","fields":{"headline":" Russia launches six hypersonic missiles in massive barrage against Ukraine","bodyText":"Russia launched six hypersonic missiles able to evade air defences in the early hours of Thursday morning as it unleashed its largest missile barrage against Ukraine in three weeks. Critical infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions had been hit, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. At least six people were killed in a missile strike on a residential area in the western Lviv region, 440 miles (700km) from the frontline, according to emergency services. Three buildings were destroyed by fire after the strike and rescue workers were combing through rubble looking for more possible victims. “The occupiers can only terrorise civilians. That’s all they can do. But it won’t help them. They won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done,” Zelenskiy said in a statement. In the capital, Kyiv, the seven-hour alert through the night was the longest of Russia’s five-month air campaign. Ukrainian officials said Moscow had fired six of its Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, an unprecedented number, which Ukraine has no way of shooting down. Russia is believed to have only a few dozen of the missiles, which the president, Vladimir Putin, regularly touts in speeches as a weapon for which Nato has no answer. For much of Thursday the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s largest – was forced to rely on diesel-powered generators after Ukrainian authorities said missile attacks had damaged power lines. The plant, which Russia has held since capturing it early in the war, is near the frontline and both sides have warned of a potential for nuclear accidents there caused by fighting. The power grid operator Ukrenergo said in the afternoon that the power supply had been restored and the plant was switching away from generators. Russian-installed officials called the temporary cutoff a Ukrainian provocation. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, urged again for a protection zone around the plant. “Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,” he told the International Atomic Energy Agency’s 35-nation board of governors. Ukraine’s air force said the attack comprised, in total, “81 missiles of various types”, launched from Russian aircraft and carriers in the Black Sea. Defence forces destroyed 34 cruise missiles and four drones, it added. “Unfortunately, a missile of the Kinzhal type hit an infrastructure object,” said Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv region’s military administration. The military administration said 40% of people in the capital were without heating on Thursday morning. The city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions were reported in the Holosiivskyi district, and two people were wounded in the Sviatoshynskyi district. Smoke could be seen rising from a facility in Holosiivskyi and police cordoned off all roads leading to it. The governor of Odesa region said a mass missile attack hit an energy facility in the port city, cutting power. Residential areas were also struck. Kharkiv was left without electricity as a result of the overnight attack, according to Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. The regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov, said the city and region had been hit by 15 strikes, with targets including infrastructure. Synyehubov said two women in their 70s were injured in Pisochyn and an agricultural facility was damaged in Slobozhanske. Multiple settlements were shelled on Wednesday, damaging houses and commercial buildings, he added. Other blasts were reported in the central city of Dnipro and regions throughout Ukraine. The Russian defence ministry said the strikes were in response to what Moscow called a terrorist attack in Bryansk region last week, when members of a group called the Russian Volunteer Corps staged an incursion from Ukraine. Russia said two civilians were killed in the incident, which Ukraine accused Moscow of staging as a false “provocation”. The missile barrage came after Ukraine’s military said late on Wednesday it had managed to push back intense Russian attacks on the city of Bakhmut, despite a Russian claim of control over its eastern half. As one of the bloodiest battles of the year-long war ground on in the small city’s ruins, Ukrainian defenders – who last week appeared to be preparing for a tactical retreat – remained defiant. “The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a letup in storming the city of Bakhmut,” the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said on Facebook. “Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.” The battle for Bakhmut, which is still under Kyiv’s control, has raged for seven months, with thousands of people killed and hundreds of buildings collapsed or charred. The few remaining civilians have been confined to basements for months with no running water, electricity or gas. Ukrainian military and political leaders now speak of hanging on to positions and inflicting as many casualties as possible on the Russians to grind down their fighting capability. Despite rumours of an imminent retreat of his troops, Zelenskiy said during an address on Wednesday evening that he had instructed the Ukrainian army to find forces to bolster the defence of the city. “I told the chief of staff to find the appropriate forces to help the guys in Bakhmut. There is no part of Ukraine about which one can say that it can be abandoned,” Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy said the battle for Bakhmut and the surrounding Donbas region was “our first priority”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/17/angela-merkel-germany-highest-order-of-merit-grosskreuz","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-17T18:10:41Z","webTitle":"Angela Merkel awarded Germany’s top order of merit despite criticism of legacy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/angela-merkel-germany-highest-order-of-merit-grosskreuz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/17/angela-merkel-germany-highest-order-of-merit-grosskreuz","fields":{"headline":"Angela Merkel awarded Germany’s top order of merit despite criticism of legacy","bodyText":"Germany’s former leader Angela Merkel has been awarded the country’s highest order of merit despite criticism over her legacy, receiving praise for her discipline and passion during 16 years as chancellor. She was presented with the honour by the president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, in Berlin on Monday evening in recognition of her contribution to German political life at an event attended by her political allies, including the current chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the former national football coach Jürgen Klinsmann, Ulrich Matthes, an award-winning actor who had helped improve how she delivered speeches, as well as family and friends. The Großkreuz, or “large cross”, is the most important order of its kind. It has been received by two previous chancellors: Konrad Adenauer in 1954 and Helmut Kohl in 1998. Paying tribute to Merkel, Steinmeier, who served in her government as foreign minister, praised her “enormous stamina, tremendous amount of self-discipline” in steering Germany, from 2005 to 2021, including through the pandemic, and the crises over eurozone debt and refugees. He also referred to her attempts to prevent Russian aggression after the annexation of Crimea. Steinmeier said Merkel stood out as Germany’s first female chancellor and as a citizen from the communist East Germany in a male-dominated party who had succeeded in politics. She achieved this despite having “no role model, no old boys’ network to guide” her through the “political undergrowth”, he said, adding: “Your mainly male adversaries often struggling to read you.” Merkel looked on, often biting or pursing her lips nervously and only occasionally smiling, appearing uncomfortable at the praise being heaped on her and having to recall some of the events mentioned. She could not have avoided the criticism surrounding the event. But some commentators and opponents said the award had come too close to the end of Merkel’s 16-year chancellorship to allow an assessment of her legacy. Others have called it problematic that her actions arguably contributed to the problems Germany – and Europe – is now facing. Merkel’s decisions to withdraw Germany from nuclear power and to try to forge a working relationship with Moscow including encouraging energy dependency on it – now seen by most Germans as a huge mistake – are both under heavy scrutiny given Russia’s war against Ukraine. Allies of Merkel have defended her record, pointing out her attempts to keep Germany and Europe on an even keel during a period of considerable upheaval. Accepting the award, Merkel, fighting the effects of a cold to which she briefly referred, thanked those she said had supported her during her time in office, individually naming those she had personally invited, including Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, Neil MacGregor, the British art historian and former museum director who she said had helped broaden her cultural horizons at a time when she was forced to be tunnel visioned about life. Merkel also thanked Klinsmann, who had unexpectedly ignited her interest in football as coach of the German national team. “He doesn’t really fit into today’s concept, because I’m not particularly sporty,” she said to laughter, but added that she had “never let him out” of her sight and that he was the person who showed her what it was “possible to achieve”. She also paid tribute to her husband, Joachim Sauer, a leading German quantum chemist whose passion for his field had “sometimes helped him I believe” to endure the daily strain of his wife’s job over 16 years. Before the ceremony at Berlin’s Bellevue Palace, Steinmeier had come under particular criticism and faced accusations he was trying to save his reputation, which was tarnished over the close ties he sought with Russian politicians, including Sergei Lavrov, his then counterpart in Moscow, when he served as foreign minister under Merkel. Some of the sharpest criticism in the run-up to the ceremony came from within the ranks of Merkel’s party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Carsten Linnemann, the deputy chair of the CDU, told German breakfast television that while it was clear Merkel had contributed greatly to Germany, “especially internationally”, she had also “made mistakes, even flagrant ones”. In particular he cited her decision to withdraw Germany from nuclear energy after the Fukushima disaster of 2011 as “a mistake in the way it was carried out”, because he said there had been little thought as to how it could be achieved. “There was no thought as to how exactly we wanted to reasonably become self-sufficient regarding our energy supplies,” he said, in reference to Germany’s dependence on Russian gas and lack of adequately developed alternative energy supplies. Linnemann also called Merkel’s refugee politics a “blatant failure”, because, he said, “we did not protect the borders, which is something that needs to be discussed as openly as the positive aspects”. Criticism also came from within the leadership ranks of the pro-business Free Democratic party and the far-left Die Linke. In contrast, the party leaders of her effective rivals the Social Democrats and the Greens, Saskia Esken and Omid Nouripour, voiced their praise for her and their support for the decision to reward her. Esken told the news portal RND: “In particular I value her diplomatic skill and her empathic wisdom with which she repeatedly managed to forge viable coalitions and compromises on the national as well as the international stage.” Nouripour said Merkel had shaped Germany “like only few others have done”. He said it was not necessary “to be in agreement with everything she did in order to recognise her great service”. Merkel has rarely been seen in public since her time in office ended in December 2021. Last year she condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine but emphasised her diplomatic efforts to avert the conflict, saying “I therefore will not apologise”, when asked if she would do so. She is writing a book about her time in office with her longstanding adviser, Beate Baumann, which is due for publication in autumn 2024 simultaneously in Germany, North America and the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/01/russians-fled-chernobyl-with-radiation-sickness-says-ukraine-as-iaea-investigates","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-01T11:49:42Z","webTitle":"UN nuclear watchdog to head mission to Chernobyl as Russians withdraw from site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/russians-fled-chernobyl-with-radiation-sickness-says-ukraine-as-iaea-investigates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/01/russians-fled-chernobyl-with-radiation-sickness-says-ukraine-as-iaea-investigates","fields":{"headline":"UN nuclear watchdog to head mission to Chernobyl as Russians withdraw from site","bodyText":"The head of the UN atomic watchdog has said he aims to lead a mission to Chernobyl as soon as possible, after Russian troops were reported to have largely withdrawn from the decommissioned nuclear power station. Rafael Grossi tweeted on Friday that he would head an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) “assistance and support” mission to the highly contaminated site of the world’s worst nuclear accident in the first of a series of such visits to Ukrainian nuclear plants. The announcement came after Ukrainian officials said the Russian soldiers who had occupied the highly contaminated plant since 24 February – the first day of the invasion – had left taking several Ukrainian service personnel with them. Some Russians remained in the surrounding exclusion zone, they said. The Ukrainian state power company Energoatom alleged that the pullout followed a number of Russian soldiers receiving “significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches in the forest in the exclusion zone, a claim the IAEA said it could not independently confirm but would investigate. Energoatom said the troops had “panicked at the first sign of illness”, which “showed up very quickly”. Chernobyl’s No 4 reactor exploded on 26 April 1986, killing hundreds and spreading radioactive contamination west across Europe. The IAEA said earlier on Friday Kyiv had informed it that Russia had transferred control of the site back to the Ukrainians charged with overseeing the safe storage of spent fuel rods and maintaining the concrete-encased ruins of the reactor. But the UN agency said it could not independently confirm the claim that the Russian soldiers, whose capture of the plant raised fears around the world of increased radiological risks, had been exposed to radiation. Energoatom did not say how many soldiers were involved and gave no details of how they had been affected. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk also said Russian troops were exposed to radiation after digging trenches in the forest. Some Ukrainian reports have suggested the soldiers were taken to a special medical facility in nearby Belarus after driving tanks through the exclusion zone, kicking up radioactive dust. The Kremlin has not commented on the claims. Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists, told the Associated Press on Friday it seemed unlikely a large number of troops would develop severe radiation illness, but added that it was impossible to know for sure without more details. Citing plant workers, Energoatom said in a statement on Friday that the “Russian occupiers, as they ran away from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, took members of the national guard, whom they had held hostage since 24 February, with them”. The Ukrainian government had repeatedly expressed safety concerns about Chernobyl and demanded the immediate withdrawal of the Russian troops, whose presence prevented the normal rotation of personnel for several weeks. Russian forces also retreated from the nearby town of Slavutych, where Chernobyl workers lived, Energoatom said, and the IAEA said it was preparing to send its first assistance and support mission to Chernobyl within the next few days. Grossi was due to hold talks with senior Russian officials in Kaliningrad on Friday after visiting a nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on Wednesday on his first trip to the country since the invasion. The IAEA chief, who has repeatedly warned of the dangers of the conflict – Ukraine has 15 reactors at four active nuclear power plants, as well as stores of nuclear waste at Chernobyl and elsewhere – was expected to hold a press conference at the IAEA’s headquarters in Vienna later on Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-400-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-30T14:06:55Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 400 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-400-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-400-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 400 of the invasion","bodyText":"A Moscow court has formally arrested a reporter for the Wall Street Journal in relation to espionage allegations, according to Russian law enforcement agencies. Russia’s top security agency said Evan Gershkovich was detained in the Ural Mountains city of Ekaterinburg while allegedly trying to obtain classified information. The security service alleged that Gershkovich “was collecting classified information about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military industrial complex.” The Wall Street Journal “vehemently denies” allegations of espionage against Gershkovich, the newspaper said in a statement. The Moscow court has ordered Gershkovich should be held in pre-trial custody for nearly two months until 29 May, according to a court document. Gershkovich told the court that he was not guilty of espionage, state-run Tass news agency is reporting. A lawyer representing Gershkovich was not allowed to attend the hearing, according to Tass. Russian forces have had some success in the eastern frontline city of Bakhmut, Ukrainian military officials said on Wednesday evening, adding that their fighters were still holding on in a battle that has lasted several months. The US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War’s regular update appears to support this, saying, “geolocated footage published on March 28 and 29 indicates that Russian forces advanced in southern and southwestern Bakhmut.” Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said Moscow will continue to give the US advance notice about its missile tests despite suspending participation in the New Start nuclear arms treaty, reversing a statement he made on Wednesday. The White House on Tuesday said the US had told Russia it would cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces after Moscow’s refusal to do so. Alexei Moskalyov, a Russian man who was sentenced to two years in prison for discrediting the Russian armed forces, and whose daughter was taken into care, has been detained after fleeing house arrest, human rights activist and lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov said on Thursday. It was earlier reported that Moskalyov was arrested in Minsk in Belarus, having fled his house arrest. The UK Ministry of Defence reports, citing Russian media, that authorities are preparing to launch a major recruitment campaign aimed at signing up 400,000 new troops to fight in Ukraine. Ukrainian volunteers who have been evacuating civilians from the frontlines of the war with Russia say some parents have been hiding their children in basements to prevent them from being taken. While parents have given different reasons, most volunteers have attributed the phenomenon to a combination of poverty and the psychological condition of the families, who have been living under bombing for months. European Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski would support curbs on trading with Ukraine if Poland proposed such a solution, he said on Thursday, amid anger from farmers over the effect of Ukrainian imports on grain prices. Lawmakers from the pro-Russia, far-right Freedom Party walked out of the lower house of Austria’s parliament on Thursday during a speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, protesting that it violated Austria’s neutrality. Austria says its neutrality prevents it from military involvement in the conflict and while it supports Ukraine politically it cannot send the country weapons in its fight against the Russian invasion. The Freedom Party (FPÖ) had warned days before that it would hold some form of protest against the address. Four bankers who helped a close friend of Vladimir Putin move millions of francs through Swiss bank accounts have been convicted of lacking diligence in financial transactions. The four were found guilty on Thursday of helping Sergey Roldugin, a concert cellist who has been dubbed “Putin’s wallet” by the Swiss government. China said its military was willing to work together with the Russian military to strengthen strategic communication and coordination. Dymtro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, has criticised the fact that Russia will take over chairing the UN security council on 1 April, describing it as a “bad joke”. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to attend the Nato foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on 3 April to 5 April. He will meet Kuleba, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell and Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg. King Charles III lauded the current unity between the UK and Germany in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying “the scourge of war is back in Europe”. The king said both the UK and Germany had shown “vital leadership” and praised Berlin’s decision to provide large military support to Ukraine as “remarkably courageous, important and appreciated”. Criticism by some European governments – including Ukraine’s – of a plan for a full return of Russian and Belarusian athletes to international sport is deplorable and cuts into the autonomy of sport, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) president, Thomas Bach, said on Thursday. Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Thursday that Moscow was still talking to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the idea of a safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that has been controlled by Russian forces since March 2022. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, had made a second visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine on Wednesday amid an escalation in the fighting around it. Rafael Mariano Grossi was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: “It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked.” Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday. Vladimir Putin has aimed to make the Yars missile system, which replaced the Topol system, part of Russia’s “invincible weapons” and the mainstay of the ground-based component of its nuclear arsenal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/27/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T19:00:37Z","webTitle":"What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

Six months of hell in Ukraine: how Putin’s war reached deadlock This week, Ukraine celebrated 31 years of independence from Soviet rule and marked six months of fighting against Moscow’s forces. The Russian president’s hopes of a swift victory have come to nothing. Peace talks have stalled. Where do we go from here? asks Shaun Walker. In the early hours of the morning of 24 February, the Russian assault began, with missiles raining down on targets across Ukraine and ground troops pouring into the country from three directions. That fateful decision has changed Ukraine, Russia and the world irrevocably over the intervening six months. Thousands of Ukrainians are dead and millions displaced. In the chaotic first days, events moved incredibly fast. By the end of the first week, the country had already settled into a new reality. Split-second decisions often meant life or death. Throughout the occupied areas around Kyiv, Russian soldiers committed murder and other war crimes, leaving psychological wounds that are likely to fester for generations. In the southern city of Mariupol, stories of burying bodies in shallow courtyard graves, of sheltering in damp, freezing basements, of illness, miscarriages, starvation and deprivation, were reminiscent of the second world war. However, amid all the horror and trauma, an uplifting story emerged of a newly united country where previous divisions evaporated in the face of the existential threat from the east. Ukraine independence day overshadowed by fear Isobel Koshiw and Emma Graham-Harrison reported from Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, where the fear of escalating Russian attacks overshadowed a sombre independence day on Wednesday. A display of destroyed Russian tanks and other military equipment on the main street replaced the usual military parade through the city centre, both a celebration of Ukraine’s military success and a trolling of Moscow’s expectations of a quick victory. “I’m constantly worried and praying that our skies remain blue,” said Yana Pasychnyk, a choral singer in one of Ukraine’s national choirs. “People I know, my godson even, is fighting at the front. There’s no celebration today. I can’t even believe that this is happening”. Many in the capital took stock of both their achievements and losses. Few outside Ukraine, even among its allies, expected the country to hold off Russia’s army so effectively, including in a decisive victory outside Kyiv. Shortly before Zelenskiy was scheduled to appear before the UN security council, news of a Russian strike at a train station in the eastern Ukrainian town of Chaplyne surfaced. At least 25 people were killed and 50 wounded. Shelling disconnects Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from Ukraine grid Fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. The plant was disconnected twice after a blaze at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plant affected the fourth and last connection into the plant’s reactors, Isobel Koshiw explained. Disconnecting the plant from the grid is dangerous because it raises the risk of catastrophic failure of the electricity-run cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods. “Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster,” Zelenskiy claimed late on Thursday. “If the diesel generators had not turned on … if our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident.” Earlier in the week, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company shared a detailed plan drawn up by Russia to disconnect the plant with Emma Graham-Harrison. Petro Kotin said Russian engineers had already drawn up a blueprint for a switch on the grounds of emergency planning should fighting sever remaining power connections. “The precondition for this plan was heavy damage of all lines which connect Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Ukrainian system.” The plant’s electricity connections were already in a critical situation, with three of the four main lines connecting it to Ukraine’s grid broken during the war, and two of the three back-up lines connecting it to a conventional power plant also downed, Kotin added. Daughter of Putin ally killed by car bomb in Moscow Andrew Roth covered the moment the daughter of an ultranationalist Russian ideologue and ally of Vladimir Putin was killed in a car bomb on the outskirts of Moscow on Saturday night. Darya Dugina, whose father is the Russian political commentator Alexander Dugin, died when the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving was ripped apart by a powerful explosion at about 9.30pm local time (1930 BST), according to investigators. Prominent Russian hawks tried – without evidence – to quickly blame Kyiv for the attack, calling it an “assassination attempt” orchestrated by Ukraine’s intelligence services. Kyiv has strongly denied the allegations. Shaun Walker mused how each new claim over the attack seemed to raise more questions than it answered. Russia’s FSB security service claimed to have cracked the case, alleging a Ukrainian woman from the country’s Azov regiment entered Russia with her 12-year-old daughter in tow before moving around in her Mini Cooper, planting and detonating a professional explosive device and finally leaving the country undetected. If the FSB’s version of events were true, it is a shocking agency failure and, if false, it is a strangely self-incriminating tale to invent. Other versions of events floated also seemed far from watertight. The former Russian MP Ilya Ponomarev, now living in exile in Kyiv, claimed that partisans from a hitherto-unknown group called the National Republican Army were behind the attack. But Ponomarev did not provide any evidence, and many observers have dismissed the claim as a publicity stunt. Officials in Ukraine suggested the killing was more likely to be a “false flag” operation, organised by the Russian state in order to frame Ukraine and provide a justification for further violence. Five predictions for the next six months in the Ukraine war Dan Sabbagh provides a rundown of what to expect for the next six months of Russia’s invasion. 1. The war will probably run on for a year at least but is essentially deadlocked and its intensity is lessening. Six months of war may have gone by, but neither Ukraine nor Russia are ready to stop fighting. There have been no recent negotiations and movement in the frontlines has been minimal since June. Both sides are struggling for momentum and increasingly appear combat-exhausted. 2. Ukraine has no means of effective conventional counterattack, while guerrilla raids are an optimistic way to precipitate a Russian collapse. Ukraine would like to retake Kherson in the south but has so far failed to do so, shifting its strategy to mounting long-range missile attacks and daring special forces raids on Russian bases deep behind the frontlines. 3. Russia is likely to be shifting to holding on its gains and annexing Ukraine territory. Russia has no new offensive plan but by holding large swathes of Ukrainian territory in the east and south, it is actively talking about holding annexation referendums. With cooler weather fast approaching, it is likely to focus on consolidating what it has. 4. Winter will precipitate a fresh refugee crisis and create an opportunity for whoever can best prepare. Ukraine has no gas heating available for many in frontline areas, and is concerned Russia will target its energy grid and even turn off the vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, precipitating what could be a fresh wave of migration abroad in the winter. Spring, though, could be the time for a renewed attack, with each side wanting to replenish and prepare for another fighting season. 5. The west needs to decide if it wants Ukraine to win or just hold on. Ukraine would have been defeated without western military aid. But at no point so far has the west supplied enough artillery or other weapons, such as fighter jets, that would allow Kyiv to drive the invaders back. At the same time, the west needs to match humanitarian help to the huge and growing need.

No wonder Australian kids don’t vote conservative","bodyText":"Among the myriad indicators of Liberal dysfunction, one statistic leaps out: voters under 34 now prefer the Greens to the Coalition. The figures suggest Australian youth reject the traditional alternative government, opting instead for a party considerably to Labor’s left. No one should be surprised that conservatism does not appeal to those with nothing to conserve, nor that young people reject a status quo so manifestly stacked against them. The recent stories about student debt illustrate the rigged hand dealt to the young. Hecs-Help debts don’t gather interest. That’s because they’re not meant to grow – but, suddenly, they are. Back in the day, the indexation of student loan to inflation didn’t signify much. In today’s economy, however, an average debt of $25,000 jumps by $1,760 after June. According to the National Union of Students, the latest rise in CPI increases the liabilities of graduates by a remarkable $4.5bn. The hike feels both grotesquely unfair, but also, in a way, entirely predictable, another grim example of young people punished for doing everything right. The social theorist Stuart Hall famously described race as the modality through which class gets lived. Something similar might be said about age, a category into which every injustice seems to crystallise. Consider housing. Despite a softer property market, home ownership remains impossible for much of the population. If rising interest rates pushed prices down marginally, they rendered mortgages correspondingly less viable, while contributing to a precipitous increase in rents. To put it another way, people still can’t buy houses – and now they can’t rent them, either. The housing crisis screws lots of people (Anglicare describes fewer than 1% of rental properties as within the budget of those on the minimum wage) but, in particular, it screws the young, who can’t muster deposits for bank loans, and feel deep in their bones they never will. Understandably, many contrast their circumstances with the norms prevailing a few decades ago, back when Matt Groening could conceive a TV show centred on a schlubbish everyman in a dead-end job and then portray Homer Simpson living in a spacious suburban house with a wife and three kids. Homer still toils in Springfield’s nuclear power plant but his demographic cohort now runs the world. In Australia, most of our politicians attended (as did this writer) university back when students paid next to nothing for education. Not coincidentally, the average parliamentarian owns, or has a stake in, two houses, with many MPs having considerably more. Karen Andrews, for instance, reportedly owns seven properties and Tony Burke, six; one-time public housing tenant Anthony Albanese now gets $115,000 in rent from his real estate portfolio. The generational unfairness evident manifests just about everywhere. Take a look at the ABC’s mind-blowing visualisation (really – just look at it!) of the stage-three tax cuts, a policy to which Labor apparently remains committed. As Guardian columnist Greg Jericho writes: “Almost half of the total benefits go to the richest 3% and so massive are the costs at $300bn over 9 years, that you could raise jobseeker from its current rate of $693 a fortnight to $1,925 and you would still end up with a smaller government deficit in 2032-33 than you would with the Stage 3 tax cuts.” But it’s also worth noting that, as well as facilitating a tremendous transfer of wealth to the rich (such as politicians, who stand to benefit by $18m in the next decade), the change disproportionately rewards older Australians, with those under 25 receiving only 2.8% of the billions directed to the ageing and the well-to-do in 2024. Even as he slashes the governmental revenue base, Albanese wants to spend $368bn on nuclear submarines. I’ve written previously on the dangers of the arms race playing out in Asia Pacific and the astonishing insouciance with which strategists now discuss conflict between nuclear powers. But recall, too, how when the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald convened a panel of anti-China hawks to urge a “psychological shift” in preparedness for war, its experts also suggested the reintroduction of military service. Now, we’re not going to see conscription any time soon but the very suggestion illustrates the dynamic of intensifying geostrategic tension: old people might plan wars but young people will have to fight them. And then there’s climate change, the most profound generational crime imaginable. Environmentalists describe the period after the second world war as “the great acceleration”, when the spread of American-style consumer capitalism massively intensified the depletion of nature. That era also coincided with the baby boom. By contrast, if you’re 20 now, you’ll turn 47 in 2050, meaning you’ll still be in the prime of life as, on current trends, parts of the planet become too hot for human habitation, extreme weather grows increasingly common, millions of people get driven from their homes and extinctions cascade through the biosphere. That’s the legacy handed to young people by their elders, a crisis on a scale unparalleled in human history. No wonder the kids don’t vote Liberal – and that so many of them mistrust the ALP. Of course, as a theory of social change, generationalism only gets you so far. Poverty, racism and bigotry affect people of all ages. No one can live on Australia’s welfare system – but, statistically, one of the biggest groups forced to do so consists of women over 45. While most voters under 30 despise the conservatives, you can still find plenty of young men attracted to the far right. For all the memes mocking Karens, today’s progressives owe a huge intellectual debt to a New Left founded by boomers. Sure, some Vietnam-era protesters aged into a sour conservatism but plenty of them didn’t: at any environment or refugee rally, you’ll encounter octogenarians far more militant than the gen Zers around them. As for climate change, it’s an oppression multiplier, with global heating disproportionately affecting all the traditional victims of injustice. Nevertheless, it’s entirely right for young people to feel cheated by what they’ve inherited, to despair about those politicians who won’t live to see the consequences of their environmental timidity, and to despise the greybeards wringing their hands about gender diversity and drag queens while lauding as a comic genius an old guy in a dress. A thousand years or so ago, Bob Dylan warned parents that their sons and daughters were beyond their command. If youth rebellion was justified then, it’s a million times more warranted today. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/30/extend-life-hinkley-point-b-reactor-avert-blackout-risk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-30T19:03:56Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point B owner says it will not extend life of nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/30/extend-life-hinkley-point-b-reactor-avert-blackout-risk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/30/extend-life-hinkley-point-b-reactor-avert-blackout-risk","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point B owner says it will not extend life of nuclear plant","bodyText":"The owner of one of the UK’s six nuclear power plants has said it will not extend its life beyond a planned shutdown in summer, despite officials raising concerns over the danger of blackouts in the months that follow. The French-owned EDF Energy sent a memo to staff on Monday in which it said it would not postpone the closure of the two reactors at Hinkley Point B in Somerset, which are scheduled to be shut down on 8 July and 1 August. The closure of the plant will remove nearly a gigawatt of power generation capacity from the UK’s system – enough to supply 1.5m homes – before a winter in which the war in Ukraine is expected to weigh heavily on electricity supplies. The government has played down fears of power cuts later this year, after it emerged that officials had modelled a “reasonable worst-case scenario” that could include millions of households being forced to limit their electricity consumption at peak times. That modelling, which was first reported by the Times, included an option to extend Hinkley Point B, something mooted by experts and politicians for months. But it is understood the government had not made any formal request for EDF to keep the reactors open. The government is scrambling to secure enough electricity to maintain buffers during the winter as households struggle with a cost of living crisis driven by energy prices that are expected to increase further in the autumn. Last week the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, wrote to the National Grid’s electricity system operator, asking it to work with the owners of coal-fired power plants that were due to closed down in September to extend their operating lives. This was despite the government’s commitment to rapidly phase out the heavily polluting fuel. Chris Philp, a culture minister who does not have oversight of the energy industry, told Times Radio on Monday morning that Kwarteng was considering whether Hinkley Point B might continue beyond its “planned end of life”. But later in the day EDF wrote to staff: “Although it is technically feasible to extend operations [at the nuclear plant] for up to six months, the time required to do this and to be confident we would be ready for winter operating has now run out.” The memo, which was revealed by the Financial Times, added that an extension would involve compiling a detailed safety case that would have to be approved by the UK’s nuclear regulator. A government source said any decision to apply for an extension would be a matter for EDF and the regulator, and added that the government had secured enough power capacity even without extending the operation of the coal or nuclear plants. However, industry sources with knowledge of the matter said it was very likely that EDF would require a written request from a minister before deciding to go through the laborious process of submitting a new safety case to the regulator, which is run at arm’s length from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). “On Hinkley B, there is no technical reason it can’t continue to operate, if they can satisfy the regulators. For EDF, it will be fundamentally an economic decision,” said Malcolm Grimston, an honorary senior research fellow at Imperial College London’s centre for energy policy and technology. Insiders in the sector expressed concern over the lack of time the government had left to take any action, with one saying: “They’ve left it right to the very end, and we’re not sure if it’s possible.” Sue Ferns, the senior deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, which represents engineers including those who work in the nuclear industry, said: “All options to prevent energy blackouts this winter must be explored. “The government must ask nuclear power plant operators to urgently explore safely extending the life of reactors due to be decommissioned in the coming months, including Hinkley Point B, which is otherwise due to come offline this summer.” A spokesperson for Boris Johnson said: “Neither the government or National Grid expect power cuts this winter.” Sources at BEIS also suggested the prospect of rolling blackouts was “very unlikely”. EDF declined to comment. A government spokesperson said: “Any extensions to operational dates for the UK’s nuclear power stations are a matter for the operator of the stations, EDF and the regulator the Office of Nuclear Regulation, which are based on safety considerations. “The government has no direct involvement in this process and has not made any requests of this kind.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/02/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-power-plant-physical-integrity-violated-un-nuclear-chief-says","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-02T20:32:32Z","webTitle":"Physical integrity of Zaporizhzhia plant ‘violated’, says UN nuclear chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/02/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-power-plant-physical-integrity-violated-un-nuclear-chief-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/02/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-power-plant-physical-integrity-violated-un-nuclear-chief-says","fields":{"headline":"Physical integrity of Zaporizhzhia plant ‘violated’, says UN nuclear chief","bodyText":"The “physical integrity” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in south-eastern Ukraine has been “violated”, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said, as Ukraine’s authorities accused Russia of misleading the inspection mission. After leading a team of inspectors to the Russian-occupied plant, the biggest nuclear power station in Europe, Rafael Grossi said that two IAEA experts would stay on permanently to provide constant monitoring and an uninterrupted flow of information to IAEA headquarters in Vienna. Grossi hoped the agency’s presence would help “stabilise” the situation there, after recent instances of shelling of the plant. But he said he remained very concerned about safety. “It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” Grossi told reporters. “Irrespective of the kinetic power of whatever you are throwing at the plant, it’s unacceptable under any safety and security criteria.” He said his other two main concerns were the external power supply which had been interrupted recently triggering the emergency diesel generators to switch on to keep cooling and other systems going, and the condition of the staff. Once back in Vienna, Grossi said it was “admirable” that Ukrainian technical staff were continuing to work to keep the plant going (two of the six reactors are still functioning) and maintaining professional relations with their Russian counterparts, but he added: “There is a latent tension there because of the obvious reasons of the war.” Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, Energoatom, had claimed that the IAEA was not shown certain areas of the site, and instead had witnessed a staged “show”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of intimidating residents in the nearby town of Enerhodar to lie to the IAEA representatives about events at the plant and “sign things”. Grossi insisted he and his team had seen “everything I request to see”, but he conceded he was not able to talk to any of the Russian soldiers who have commandeered the plant’s crisis centre as their headquarters. “The military presence there did not approach us in any way and were not available when I asked for a couple of occasions to talk to one of them,” he said. The IAEA chief said an alternative crisis centre has been set up but added that he will be requesting the military to hand back the purpose built facility they are occupying. Grossi left six of his staff behind at the site, but four of them will leave next week, leaving two IAEA experts there permanently. The IAEA is there to stay for as long as it is needed. We are not leaving. We’re not going anywhere,” Grossi said. “For those who may have intentions on the plant, knowing that international inspectors are there, witnessing and informing immediately what is happening, has an inherently very important stabilising effect.” Ukraine and Russia have traded blame over attacks on and near the plant, with Ukraine claiming they are false-flag operations carried out by Russia. Zelenskiy also voiced concerns over Ukrainian and international journalists not being allowed to travel with the delegation, as previously agreed. He said the occupying forces did not allow the journalists to cross the frontlines. “Unfortunately, IAEA representatives did not protect representatives of independent media,” said Zelenskiy, who said only Russian propagandists were present. Zelenskiy said the key thing for Ukraine and the international community was the demilitarisation of the plant. He said it was “bad that we have not yet heard the appropriate calls [for demilitarisation] from the IAEA”. Russian state media have published videos of Russian officials from Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear agency, giving the mission a tour of the plant. Grossi said his agency would complete a full report on the visit by early next week and he would brief the UN security council on the visit next Tuesday. The Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, told Ukraine’s 1+1 television channel that “it is important for us that the station must be under national control, meaning that the station must be returned to the control of Ukraine”. Grossi said the security situation was “pretty difficult” during his visit. “There were moments where fire was obvious, heavy machine gun, artillery, mortars two or three times – we were very concerned.” But he said the mission received “splendid support from the UN security team”. “I think we showed that the international community is there, could be there and we will be continuing this,” Grossi said. Zaporizhzhia, has faced repeated shelling in recent weeks, with Kyiv and Moscow blaming each other for the attacks, raising concerns of a possible disaster. On Thursday, a dawn shelling attack on the area forced one of the plant’s six reactors to shut down. On Friday afternoon the electricity supply to a reactor was reconnected after it was cut for the second time in 10 days because of shelling, according to Energoatom. The plant needs electricity for its cooling and security systems. In the event all supply lines are cut, the plant’s workers would have 90 minutes to avoid dangerous overheating. In a video address late on Thursday, Zelenskiy reiterated his frequent calls that all troops be removed from the plant. “The main thing that must happen is the demilitarisation of the station’s territory,” he said. “Demilitarisation and full control of Ukrainian nuclear workers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/apr/19/rolls-royce-expecting-uk-approval-for-small-nuclear-reactors-by-mid-2024","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-19T10:20:29Z","webTitle":"Rolls-Royce expects UK approval for small nuclear reactors by mid-2024","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/rolls-royce-expecting-uk-approval-for-small-nuclear-reactors-by-mid-2024","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/apr/19/rolls-royce-expecting-uk-approval-for-small-nuclear-reactors-by-mid-2024","fields":{"headline":"Rolls-Royce expects UK approval for small nuclear reactors by mid-2024","bodyText":"Rolls-Royce is to start building parts for its small modular nuclear reactors in anticipation of receiving regulatory approval from the British government by 2024, one of its directors has said. Paul Stein, the chairman of Rolls-Royce SMR, a subsidiary of the FTSE 100 engineering company, said he hoped to be providing power to the UK’s national grid by 2029. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are seen by their proponents as a way to build nuclear power plants in factories, a method that could be cheaper and quicker than traditional designs. The technology, based on the reactors used in nuclear submarines, is seen by Rolls-Royce as a potential earner far beyond any previous business such as jet engines or diesel motors. The government under Boris Johnson put nuclear power at the centre of its energy strategy announced earlier this month, in response to climate concerns and a desire to ditch Russian gas. SMRs are expected to play an inportant role in an expansion of nuclear to supply a quarter of the UK’s energy needs. Lower costs would be crucial in justifying the nuclear push, given that onshore wind is seen as much cheaper and quicker to install. Speaking to Reuters in an interview conducted virtually, Stein said the regulatory “process has been kicked off, and will likely be complete in the middle of 2024. We are trying to work with the UK government, and others to get going now placing orders, so we can get power on grid by 2029.” Other companies are also planning to build SMRs, including the US’s Westinghouse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/05/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-163-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-05T12:31:57Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 163 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-163-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/05/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-163-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 163 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine has accused Russian forces of strikes near a nuclear reactor at the Zaporizhzhia power plant in the country’s southeast, which has been occupied since the early days of the invasion. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-run operator of the country’s nuclear power plants, said in a statement: “Three strikes were recorded on the site of the plant, near one of the power blocks where the nuclear reactor is located.” Three ships carrying almost 60,000 tonnes of grain between them have departed Ukrainian Black Sea ports and are on their way to Britain, Ireland and Turkey respectively. Oleksandr Kubrakov, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, said he plans “to ensure ports have the ability to handle more than 100 vessels per month”. Vladimir Putin has met Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for talks that were expected to focus on Russia’s war in Ukraine and that are being rumoured to include Kremlin efforts to circumvent western sanctions. Putin welcomed Erdoğan to Sochi, a resort city on the Black Sea, by thanking the Turkish president for help in securing an international deal that resumed exports of grain from Ukraine that had been disrupted by the Kremlin war machine – as well as Russian foodstuffs and fertilisers – to world markets. They agreed to boost cooperation in the transport, agriculture, finance and construction industries, they said in a joint statement after a four-hour meeting. Russia says it is ready to talk about a prisoner swap with the US following Wednesday’s nine-year jail sentence for US basketball player Brittney Griner. However, the Kremlin says any such negotiations should not be played out publicly. Amnesty International has said it stands by its accusation that Ukraine is endangering civilians by creating army bases in residential areas to counter Russian forces, after a report from the rights group prompted a furious response from Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, criticised Amnesty over the report published on Thursday, saying the rights group was drawing a false equivalence between Ukraine as victim of aggression and the Russian invaders. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has raised concerns about the “security and safety” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is under Russian control. It says Russia has “used artillery units based in these areas to target Ukrainian territory on the western bank of the Dnipro river”. An EU plan to cut gas use and help Germany wean itself off dependency on Russia will come into effect early next week, the bloc’s presidency said on Friday. Last week, EU member states agreed to reduce their use of gas by 15% over the winter, with exceptions for some countries and despite opposition from Hungary. Canada is sending up to 225 Canadian armed forces to the UK to recommence the training of Ukrainian military recruits, the Canadian defence minister has announced. Since 2015, Canada has trained 33,000 Ukrainian military and security personnel but in February paused aspects of the training. A US official has accused Moscow of preparing to plant fake evidence to make it look like the recent mass killing of Ukrainian prisoners in an attack on a Russian-controlled prison was caused by Ukraine. Kyiv and Moscow have traded blame over the strikes on the prison in Kremlin-controlled Olenivka, in eastern Ukraine, last week. A leading Russian hypersonics expert has been arrested on suspicion of treason, the state-controlled TASS news agency reported on Friday. Andrei Shiplyuk heads the hypersonics laboratory at the Novosibirsk Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, according to the institute’s website, and has in recent years coordinated research to support the development of hypersonic missile systems, Reuters reports. Ukraine has ceded some territory in the Donbas region to Russian forces, with Kyiv acknowledging Russia’s “partial success” in recent days. Zelenskiy has described the pressure his forces are under in the east of the country as “hell”. They have recaptured two villages near the city of Sloviansk, according to Ukrainian general Oleksiy Hromov, but have been forced to abandon a coal mine regarded as a key defensive position as forces are pushed to the outskirts of Avdiivka. Russia may launch an offensive in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson to try to wrest back momentum from Kyiv and has been visibly building up forces, Hromov said on Thursday. Much of the region is already occupied by Russia after it captured areas at the beginning of its invasion, but Ukrainian forces have been developing a counter-offensive to regain territory."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-289-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-09T01:22:36Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 289 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-289-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-289-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 289 of the invasion","bodyText":"Russian forces have shelled the “entire front line” in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, has said. The fiercest fighting was near the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, he said, adding that Russian troops were also trying to advance near Lyman, which was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in November. US basketball star Brittney Griner has been released in a prisoner swap with Russia in exchange for former arms dealer Viktor Bout and was heading back to the United States on Thursday, ending what President Joe Biden called months of “hell” for her and her wife. Russian forces have installed multiple rocket launchers at Ukraine’s shut-down Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials claimed Thursday, raising fears Europe’s largest atomic power station could be used as a base to fire on Ukrainian territory, heightening radiation dangers. Ukraine’s state-run power agency has accused Russian forces of abducting two senior Ukrainian staff at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Energoatom said the two abducted members of staff were beaten before being driven off in an “unknown direction” on Thursday. A third worker, who was detained, was responsible for safety at the plant, it said. Vladimir Putin mentioned a potential settlement to end his war in Ukraine on Friday while still claiming that his “special military operation” was going to plan. Putin also discussed the potential for a nuclear war in his remarks on Friday, saying that Russian nuclear doctrine doesn’t allow for a preventive strike and that in the case of all-out war, strikes against Russia would be “inevitable”. Putin’s remarks came a day after he appeared to revel in recent Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. Drinking what appeared to be sparkling wine, Putin vowed to keep battering Ukraine’s energy grid despite an outcry against the systematic attacks that have plunged millions into cold and darkness as winter sets in. Putin also said Russia may cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the G7’s price cap on its oil. His comments came after the G7, the EU and Australia announced a $60-a-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil last week. The UK’s ambassador to the UN, Barbara Woodward, said Russia is attempting to obtain more weapons from Iran, including hundreds of ballistic missiles. Moscow is offering Tehran an “unprecedented level” of military and technical support in return for it supplying weapons for the war in Ukraine, Woodward told reporters. Meanwhile, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, warned that Russia is “expanding and modernising its nuclear arsenal”. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Thursday the United States is confident that Finland and Sweden will be approved soon for membership of Nato despite ratification delays from members Turkey and Hungary. After meeting his Finnish and Swedish counterparts on Thursday, Blinken said both countries had proved their bona fides to join the alliance, most notably in joining Nato to provide support to Ukraine to counter Russia’s invasion. Russia is still set on seizing parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that Putin claimed as his own, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. He added that the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Russia annexed in 2014, was vulnerable to attacks by Ukrainian forces, after officials there said they had shot down a drone near a key naval base. The US has announced fresh sanctions on dozens of people and entities over alleged human rights abuse or corruption across nine countries, including Russia, China and Iran. The latest sanctions list includes Russia’s Central Election Commission, which Washington accused of helping to oversee and monitor what the US said are “sham referendums” held in Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine, as well as 15 of its members. President Joe Biden has authorised $275m in military aid for Ukraine, the White House said. The new package will include weapons and artillery rounds, as well as equipment to help Ukraine boost its air defences, according to a statement by the US defence department. Russian shelling of a town in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine has left one person dead and two injured, according to the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. At least 12 houses were destroyed by the shelling in the town of Toretsk, he said in a Telegram post. The UK Ministry of Defence has said Russia has likely received a resupply of Iranian Shahed-131 and 136 loitering munitions. Friday’s intelligence update comes following new reports over the past three weeks of attacks involving these devices. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian general staff reported shooting down at least 14 Shahed-136s. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has announced in the Guardian that he will place new sanctions on 2,000 individuals and 400 entities across the world with connections to the Kremlin. “We are right to express our horror and revulsion, but our words will always count for more when they are backed by action,” Cleverly wrote. “I will ensure this remains the theme of British diplomacy. We are not passive observers and we should not merely voice our feelings: we will use our country’s leverage to make a difference.” Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, discussed the latest Russian attacks on the country’s infrastructure in a phone call on Friday. Sunak said “more anti-air guns and further short-range air defence missiles would arrive in the coming weeks”, Downing Street said. About 10,000 Ukrainian service personnel and roughly the same number of Ukrainian civilians are believed to be being held in Russian detention facilities, according to a Ukrainian official. Oleksandr Kononenko, who oversees human rights in the security and defence sector on behalf of Ukraine’s parliament, said the civilians were being detained illegally as prisoners of war because of their alleged association with the Ukrainian army or state. Russian forces have fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid during the war. The grid is still working despite taking major damage, a senior official said. Volodymyr Kudrytsky, the chief executive of the grid operator Ukrenergo, also told a meeting arranged by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that his officials were scouring the world for the complex equipment needed for repairs. Ukraine has introduced new emergency power cuts as it tries to repair energy infrastructure damaged in Russian airstrikes. The grid operator Ukrenergo said the situation was complicated by the weather, with western regions facing frost, rain, snow and strong winds that were causing wires to ice over, but the most difficult situation was in eastern areas, where fighting has been fiercest. Russian troops are reportedly taking part in tactical exercises in Belarus, according to the Russian defence ministry. Video clips posted by the ministry showed Russian soldiers in snow gear training near tanks in a winter landscape, firing weapons including artillery. A Russian court has sentenced the opposition politician Ilya Yashin to eight and a half years in prison on charges of spreading false information meant to discredit the Russian army. The verdict marks the most high-profile case to date of a Russian dissident being jailed for opposing the invasion of Ukraine. The EU plans to tighten up sanctions on Russia’s military and industrial complex, pro-Kremlin media and Russian nationalist groups fighting in Ukraine, according to leaked papers. A total of eight individuals are facing personal sanctions, including Russian officials said to be involved in the illegal transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children in Russia, as well as the leaders of rightwing nationalist groups. Representatives from Russia and the US met in Istanbul on Friday to discuss “difficult questions”, Russian state media reported. A US embassy spokesperson confirmed that a senior State department official met with Russian interlocutors to discuss “a narrow set of bilateral issues” that did not involve the war in Ukraine. Russia has told Zambia it pardoned a Zambian student to go and fight in Ukraine, where he was killed, according to the Zambian foreign affairs minister. Zambia has demanded answers over the death of Lemekhani Nyirenda, after Russia announced he had been killed on the battlefield in Ukraine in September. A senior Orthodox Christian cleric has been accused of engaging in anti-Ukrainian activity by supporting Russian policies in social media posts, Ukraine’s security service (SBU) said. The SBU’s statement followed a series of raids of property used by a Ukrainian branch of the Orthodox church, including the 1,000-year-old Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex, as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”. Pope Francis broke down and wept as he prayed for peace in Ukraine during a traditional Christmas visit to the Spanish Steps in Rome. Reuters reports that Francis had to stop speaking and was unable to continue for about 30 seconds, and his head trembled. He later tweeted that “peace is possible; disarmament is possible” Russian athletes have been offered a path to compete at the Paris 2024 Games even if the war in Ukraine continues to rage for another 18 months.

The defence secretary said: “We’re not going to send our own Typhoon jets in the short term to Ukraine,” in an interview with Sky News to coincide with the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion on Friday. But the comments deal a blow to Zelenskiy, who travelled to the UK this month to make a dramatic request for “wings for freedom” in a rare address by a foreign leader to both Houses of Parliament in Westminster. Instead, Wallace said that if other countries with Soviet-origin aircraft wanted to supply Ukraine instead, the UK would be willing to help provide air cover for that country to make up for the loss of jets. Downing Street said it had always believed that western jets “wouldn’t help in the immediate future given the training timelines and support systems required” but added that RAF Typhoons could help other countries. “The PM has previously described our willingness to help support other countries who might be able to offer their capabilities, we could help backfill for example, in a range of things they might be required to do,” a spokesperson added. Poland has repeatedly said it is willing to supply Ukraine with its fleet of 28 MiG-29s “as part of a wider coalition”, although at least some of the jets are thought to have been broken up and supplied to Kyiv’s air force covertly as spare parts. Kyiv has also called for it to be supplied with US-made F-16s, the most widely available fighter jet worldwide, and discussions between the US and Ukraine continue, despite an initial rejection of the plan by Joe Biden, the US president, in late January. Ukrainian pilots will need to be retrained to use any western fighter aircraft – with the process taking anywhere from three months, as some of Kyiv’s pilots say, to six to nine months, as suggested by RAF insiders. Labour said it would support the government on whatever decision it made on fighter jets. The party leader, Keir Starmer, said: “We are not going to politically divide on this. We will support the government in the decision that it makes.” Part of the problem, Wallace added, was that a rapid deployment would have to involve hundreds of British ground crew having to relocate to Ukraine for support – although Ukraine hopes to train its own engineers as needed. “Gifting a fighter jet comes with hundreds of people: engineers, pilots, training, electronic warfare. The more complicated the platform, the greater the tail,” Wallace said, referring to the need for ground support. “The west is not going to be putting troops into Ukraine in those scales. The idea that we would put Typhoons in – we would have to send 200 RAF people and we’re not going to do that … at this current stage,” he added. Aviation experts have questioned whether RAF Typhoons, which traditionally fly from long, clear runways, would be suitable for Ukraine, given its need to operate in rough, dispersed airstrips to prevent planes being shot down by Russia. King Charles offered his support for Ukraine in a personal message issued on Friday. The country’s people, he said, have “suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack” and “shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy”. A minute’s silence was led by Rishi Sunak at 11am outside No 10. Joined by his wife, Akshata Murthy, the prime minister paid his respects to Ukrainians killed in the fighting, along with Kyiv’s ambassador to Britain, Vadym Prystaiko, and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said Ukraine must not be forced into a “Munich agreement-like compromise”, referring to the failed 1938 pre-war agreement that led to the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. The Anglican leader, writing in the Daily Telegraph, also called for a “just peace” between Russia and Ukraine, and a settlement that Moscow could consider fair. “Russia cannot end up like Germany after 1919; it must be able to recover and be secure without being allowed to repeat its aggression,” he added. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, has announced an export ban on any equipment Russia is found to have used on the battlefield. The ban will mean companies cannot supply Russia with a range of items, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components. The Foreign Office also announced new sanctions on executives at several Russian companies, including the state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, two defence companies and four banks. Ukraine’s president thanked Sunak and the British people for “unwavering support” in “the fight against aggression”. Zelenskiy praised the prime minister for the sanctions package, and made no mention of the announcement regarding Typhoons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/nov/17/britishvolt-saga-exposes-the-danger-of-short-termism","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T16:33:56Z","webTitle":"Britishvolt saga exposes the danger of short-termism | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/17/britishvolt-saga-exposes-the-danger-of-short-termism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/nov/17/britishvolt-saga-exposes-the-danger-of-short-termism","fields":{"headline":"Britishvolt saga exposes the danger of short-termism","bodyText":"David Edgerton rightly draws attention to the emphasis so often placed on startup companies in UK industrial policy – or at least in political gestures towards the manufacturing sector (The woes of startup Britishvolt should shock the UK out of its Brexit self-delusion, 11 November). Real success is no easy win, especially in turning acorns into productive oak trees. For example, civil aerospace production, one of the UK’s major industrial successes, now supports several thousand jobs and reels in millions annually in foreign exchange. This achievement stands on the back of more than 75 years of largely public investment. For much of the time this was unprofitable. Up to 1974, the UK government had invested nearly £740m in civil aircraft for a return of less than £54m. The breakthrough was a result of joining the Airbus consortium. Even then, success came only with the third member of the Airbus family, the A320. This has handsomely repaid government investment of £400m, with more than £1bn returned over 30 years. Returns from later Airbus types have been more modest, but the A320 rolls into its fifth decade with 9,000 sales to date. Scouring the archives on the Airbus saga reveals persistent Treasury opposition and sceptical politicians. The lesson is that turning innovation (in this case a brilliant wing design) into solid economic success requires patience. Prof Keith Hayward London • Re the sorry story of Britishvolt, it didn’t have to be like this. In 1977, I brought together a British/Danish team to work on new materials for advanced batteries. We were the first such multinational project to receive EU funding. As part of this, the new materials that made possible the lithium-ion battery were invented by Prof John Goodenough and his team at Oxford. He received the Nobel prize for this work in 2019. I ensured a worldwide patent was taken out by my then employer, the UK Atomic Energy Authority at Harwell. Every battery later made by other companies provided licence and royalty income to the then privatised AEA Technology. This could have been used to create a world-leading advanced battery industry by now. The scientists were ready, but nothing happened. Unsurprisingly, AEA went into administration. Blame City short-termism, not government hot air. Bruce Tofield London • Dave Edgerton’s perceptive article highlights the failings of hi-tech boosterism expounded by successive Tory governments. Yet, to meet today’s challenges on climate change, the left needs to offer a new growth and innovation paradigm. To achieve this, we have to discard the baggage of the industrial era, with its blind defence of producer interests and a supply-side fixation on economically unproven technologies, such as carbon storage, or expensive and risky ones such as nuclear power. Decarbonising the country’s 28m households requires technical innovations combined with new financial models to ensure the transformation is done affordably and at scale. Labour’s green deal has the potential to meet this challenge. But it needs to break from the top-down industrial model and recognise that the decentralised innovation model offers more broad-based regeneration, providing jobs across the country.

Framatome, a subsidiary of the energy giant EDF, told Agence France-Presse news agency that it was “supporting resolution of a performance issue” at the plant. “According to the data available, the plant is operating within the safety parameters,” it said, adding that an extraordinary meeting of the power plant’s board had been called “to present all the data and the necessary decisions”. The statement came shortly after the US TV network CNN reported that Framatome had previously warned the US energy department of an “imminent radiological threat” in a letter. According to CNN, the letter included an accusation that the Chinese safety authority was “raising the acceptable limits for radiation detection outside the Taishan nuclear power plant in Guangdong province in order to avoid having to shut it down”. China’s state-run China General Nuclear Power Group said on Sunday that operations at its nuclear power station in south China met safety rules and the surrounding environment was safe. A US official told CNN “the Biden administration believes the facility is not yet at ‘crisis level’”. EDF later said there was an “increase in the concentration of certain noble gases in the primary circuit of reactor No 1” at Taishan, referring to a part of the cooling system. Noble gases are elements like argon, helium and neon, which have low chemical reactivity. Their presence in the system “is a known phenomenon, studied and provided for in the reactor operating procedures”, EDF said. Radiation levels in Hong Kong, 85 miles from the Taishan plant, were normal on Monday, according to the Hong Kong Observatory, which monitors radiation around the city. Powered up in 2018, the Taishan plant was the first worldwide to operate a next-generation EPR nuclear reactor, a pressurised water design that has been subject to years of delays in similar European projects in Britain, France and Finland. There are now two EPR power units at the plant in the city of Taishan, which sits close to the coastline of southern Guangdong – China’s most populous province. EPR reactors have been touted as promising advances in safety and efficiency over conventional reactors while producing less waste. Nuclear plants supplied less than 5% of China’s annual electricity needs in 2019, according to the National Energy Administration, but this share is expected to grow as Beijing attempts to become carbon neutral by 2060. China has 47 nuclear plants with a total generation capacity of 48.75m kilowatts – the world’s third highest after the US and France – and has invested billions of dollars to develop its nuclear energy sector. Last month, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, hailed close ties between their countries as they launched work on Russian-built nuclear power plants in China. And in December, state media reported that China had successfully powered up its “artificial sun” nuclear fusion reactor for the first time, the HL-2M Tokamak reactor, which uses a powerful magnetic field to fuse hot plasma and can reach temperatures of more than 150m C. It is China’s largest and most advanced nuclear fusion experimental research device, and scientists hope the device can potentially unlock a powerful clean energy source.

But, say experts, the extreme nature of the crisis means carers should look at specialist techniques to help calm anxieties. Mike Hughesman, a former principal educational psychologist for Service Children’s Education who has worked with children whose parents and carers are in active combat in Afghanistan and Germany, said that in acute contexts like these, it is “vital that we source advice on the lived experiences of families that have faced adversity and learned to deal with it successfully. “Too much advice is based on the study of patients who have experienced difficulty and found it hard to cope with adversity,” he said. “Not enough is based on study of the lived experiences of families and individuals that succeed against the odds.” Hughesman recommends solution-focused therapy. “It empowers people to seek out what helps them to succeed, rather than dwell on all the reasons why they haven’t,” he said. In short, he said, parents and carers must deal first with their children’s emotions before calmly exploring the facts as the children themselves see them. The next steps are to help children stay grounded on a day-to-day basis through routines. “Finally,” he said. “We need to find ways to help them be proactive and overcome their sense of powerlessness.” Prof Vivian Hill, programme director at UCL Institute of Education’s department of psychology and human development, warned that fake news on social media can make the situation feel even more frightening and unpredictable than it is already. “It is important to reassure children and talk to them in a way that reflects their age and understanding,” she added. “Don’t overcomplicate things for younger children: stick to the facts. Older children may want to discuss political and historical events. Use reliable sources to support this process. Children are best supported by people they can trust but they may feel too frightened to even ask about this so be sensitive to their mood.” She recommended talking to children about diplomacy, how nobody wants there to be a nuclear attack and everything possible will be done to find a safer way to resolve this conflict. “Try to remain optimistic,” she said. “Keep to routines, do pleasurable and diverting activities with your children.” To remain optimistic, Hill said it was important for parents and carers to be aware of their own feelings and to get support from friends and family. “Some may be able to lean on support from older generations who have lived through the cold war and have direct experiences to draw on,” she said. Judith Wenban-Smith, a forensic psychologist with a special interest in families, advised that it was important to acknowledge to a child how worrying it can be to think about nuclear weapons but that they should be reassured that all countries have nuclear weapons held in very safe ways and are determined not to use them. “Then encourage the child to do something, like join CND, ask for a school assembly on the subject, contribute to a campaign or fundraiser,” she said. “Parents should not dominate the conversation: encourage the child to talk and respond to their worries specifically.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-newborn-killed-in-russian-strike-on-hospital-says-zaporizhzhia-governor","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-23T22:12:23Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: death toll rises after Russian strikes across Ukraine; European parliament ‘under cyber-attack’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-newborn-killed-in-russian-strike-on-hospital-says-zaporizhzhia-governor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-newborn-killed-in-russian-strike-on-hospital-says-zaporizhzhia-governor","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: death toll rises after Russian strikes across Ukraine; European parliament ‘under cyber-attack’","bodyText":"It’s slightly past midnight in Kyiv. Here’s a look at the biggest developments throughout the day: UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the UN security council on Wednesday that an exchange of 35 Russian and 36 Ukrainian prisoners was a positive development amid the “dark news” of Russian strikes on Ukraine. DiCarlo encouraged the parties to continue prisoner releases and follow international humanitarian law in relation to prisoners of war, Reuters reports. A Russian court on Wednesday extended by six months the detention of opposition politician Ilya Yashin, who risks being jailed for 10 years for denouncing president Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine. The 39-year-old Moscow city councillor is in the dock as part of an unprecedented crackdown on dissent in Russia, with most opposition activists either in jail or in exile. He faces up to 10 years behind bars, if convicted. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it had faith in the “success” of its offensive in Ukraine. “The future and the success of the special operation are beyond doubt,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on a visit to Armenia, using the official Moscow term to describe Russia’s assault, Agence France-Presse reports. European cities were urged to send spare generators to Ukraine to help the country through the winter in the face of Russia’s attacks on electricity infrastructure. Ukraine’s power grid came under bombardment again as the European parliament president, Roberta Metsola, launched an appeal to get generators to Ukraine. Dozens of Russian missiles were launched against Ukraine on Wednesday morning, with explosions heard in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russian forces launched 70 missiles at Ukraine in its latest “large-scale attack on crucial infrastructure facilities,” Ukraine’s armed forces said. Air raid alerts were heard across all over the country. At least seven people have been killed – including a 17-year-old girl – and 36 injured after a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, according to officials. Oleksii Kuleba, head of the regional military administration, said the entire Kyiv region was without electricity after Moscow’s airstrikes targeted critical infrastructure. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, has said the entire western Ukrainian city is “without light” after Russian strikes. Sadovyi warned that there would be “interruptions” with the city’s water supply and that he was awaiting additional information from energy experts. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm, Energoatom, has said power units of three Ukrainian nuclear power plants were switched off after Russian missile strikes across the country. In a statement, it said “due to a decrease in frequency in the energy system of Ukraine” emergency protection was activated at the Rivne, Pivdennoukrainsk and Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plants. The European parliament came under “sophisticated cyber-attacks” officials said, hours after it voted to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. The president of the European parliament, Roberta Metsola, said a pro-Kremlin group has claimed responsibility for the denial of service attack on the European parliament’s website. The European parliament has declared Russia “a terrorist regime” over its brutal war on Ukraine. In a non-binding resolution approved by a large majority of MEPs, the European parliament urged the EU’s 27 member states to make the same designation “with all the negative consequences this implies”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed the declaration. The US has announced a new $400m (£332.5m) aid package to Ukraine which will include weapons, munitions and air defence equipment. The package also includes more than 200 generators to help Ukraine deal with power outages caused by Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the UN security council on Wednesday that an exchange of 35 Russian and 36 Ukrainian prisoners was a positive development amid the “dark news” of Russian strikes on Ukraine. DiCarlo, addressing a meeting of the council requested by Ukraine, encouraged the parties to continue prisoner releases and follow international humanitarian law in relation to prisoners of war, Reuters reports. A Russian court on Wednesday extended by six months the detention of opposition politician Ilya Yashin, who risks being jailed for 10 years for denouncing president Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine. The 39-year-old Moscow city councillor is in the dock as part of an unprecedented crackdown on dissent in Russia, with most opposition activists either in jail or in exile. He faces up to 10 years behind bars, if convicted. Yashin refused to leave after Putin sent troops to Ukraine on 24 February and regularly took to his YouTube channel, which has 1.3 million subscribers, to condemn his country’s offensive. Yashin insisted in court that he would not flee the country, but the judge extended his detention by six months. I love my country and in order to live here I am ready to pay with my freedom,” he said, adding, “I am a Russian patriot,” Agence France-Presse reports. Prosecutors argued that Yashin should be kept in detention because he had “inflicted considerable damage to Russia” and “increased political tensions during the special military operation” – Russia’s term for its invasion of Ukraine. One of the opposition activist’s lawyers, Vadim Prokhorov, said that extending Yashin’s detention until 10 May was against the law. The next hearing is expected to take place on 29 November. Yashin is an ally of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny and was close to Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician assassinated near the Kremlin in 2015. France and Spain on Wednesday lambasted the European Commission’s proposed price cap on wholesale natural gas, set so high that critics have questioned if it would ever be used. Agence France-Presse reports: The EU executive on Tuesday unveiled a gas “safety ceiling” of 275 euros per megawatt hour as the bloc grapples with high energy prices spurred by Moscow’s war in Ukraine and supply cuts. But the conditions meant the cap would only kick in when EU gas prices breach that threshold for two weeks running, calculated on advance purchases through the bloc’s main gas price benchmark, TTF. The cap was also contingent on the TTF price for liquefied natural gas – an easily transportable form of gas that can be shipped worldwide – exceeding 58 euros for 10 days within that same two-week period. The only time the TTF gas price has gone above the 275-euro limit was between August 22 and 29 this year. It was running at around 120 euros in trading on Tuesday. Spanish ecological transition minister Teresa Ribera called the commission’s proposal a “joke”, saying it would cause steeper price hikes and hamper efforts to tame decades-high inflation. The French energy transition ministry criticised an “insufficient” scheme that “does not respond to the reality of the market”. “The commission must propose an operational text, not simply a text that is political grandstanding and may have negative or no effects,” it said. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it had faith in the “success” of its offensive in Ukraine. The future and the success of the special operation are beyond doubt,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on a visit to Armenia, using the official Moscow term to describe Russia’s assault, Agence France-Presse reports. He spoke to reporters as the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was set to address an urgent meeting of the UN security council later on Wednesday and after the European parliament recognised Russia as a “state sponsor of terrorism”. Peskov did not address the symbolic political step of the European legislators. But Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova earlier in the day said on messaging app Telegram: I propose designating the European parliament as a sponsor of idiocy,” she said. European cities were urged to send spare generators to Ukraine to help the country through the winter in the face of Russia’s attacks on electricity infrastructure. Ukraine’s power grid came under bombardment again as the European parliament president, Roberta Metsola, launched an appeal to get generators to Ukraine. Millions of Ukrainians are facing blackouts as Russian forces bombard key infrastructure. Ukrainians are currently without electricity as a result of Russia’s attacks on critical civilian targeted infrastructure,” Agence France-Presse reported Metsola saying. Dario Nardella, the mayor of Florence, Italy, heads a network of local authorities in Europe and said he was looking to coordinate a group of 200 European cities to send generators they have in storage to Ukraine. We’ve got the potential of sending several hundred, even industrial-sized, generators which will be able to produce quite a lot of power,” Nardella said. It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Dozens of Russian missiles were launched against Ukraine on Wednesday morning, with explosions heard in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russian forces launched 70 missiles at Ukraine in its latest “large-scale attack on crucial infrastructure facilities,” Ukraine’s armed forces said. Air raid alerts were heard across all over the country. The UN’s security council will hold an urgent meeting on Wednesday on Russia’s latest strikes at the request of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy said Ukrainians are “unbreakable” and that the country will rebuild damaged infrastructure and “get through all of this”. At least seven people have been killed – including a 17-year-old girl – and 36 injured after a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, according to officials. Oleksii Kuleba, head of the regional military administration, said the entire Kyiv region was without electricity after Moscow’s airstrikes targeted critical infrastructure.

In a statement, it said “due to a decrease in frequency in the energy system of Ukraine” emergency protection was activated at the Rivne, Pivdennoukrainsk and Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plants. Russian missile strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure caused blackouts across half of neighbouring Moldova, the deputy prime minister of Moldova said. Moldelectrica, the state-owned energy firm, is working to reconnect more than 50% of the country to electricity, Andrei Spînu, said. Moldova’s foreign affairs minister, Nicu Popescu, said he has asked for Russia’s ambassador to be summoned. A newborn baby was killed after an overnight Russian rocket attack struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s state emergency service said that a woman with her two-day-old baby and a doctor had been in the facility in the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia, that was destroyed. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said warned the Ukrainian capital faces “the worst winter since World War II” after Russian attacks on the city’s energy infrastructure. Residents in Kyiv had to be ready for the “worst case scenario” of widespread power cuts at low temperatures in which parts of the capital would have to be evacuated, he said in an interview with the German newspaper Bild. A Ukrainian security official has said suspected Russian citizens, cash and documents were seized in a raid on a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv and other Orthodox sites. The raid, which took place on Tuesday, was part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the national security and defence council, said. The European parliament came under “sophisticated cyber-attacks” officials said, hours after it voted to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. The president of the European parliament, Roberta Metsola, said a pro-Kremlin group has claimed responsibility for the denial of service attack on the European parliament’s website.

The package also includes more than 200 generators to help Ukraine deal with power outages caused by Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. Germany has angrily dismissed claims by Boris Johnson that in the run-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine it said it would be better for Ukraine to fold than to become embroiled in a long war. Johnson, interviewed by CNN, also claimed that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was in denial about the threat of invasion, and that Italy, led at the time by Mario Draghi, said it could not help because it was so dependent on Russian hydrocarbons. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog met a Russian delegation in Istanbul on Wednesday to discuss safety at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the watchdog said. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling at the weekend, leading to renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster. The UK is sending helicopters to Ukraine for the first time, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has announced. Three Sea King helicopters will be provided, with the first already in Ukraine, according to PA Media. Wallace also said an extra 10,000 artillery rounds were being sent to help Ukraine secure the territory it has recaptured from the invading forces in recent weeks. Russia has probably launched a number of Iranian manufactured uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) against Ukraine since September, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said. It’s also likely that Russia has nearly exhausted its current stock of Iran-made weapons and will seek resupply, the ministry said in its daily intelligence update. A German government spokesperson, Steffen Hebestreit, rejected Boris Johnson’s claim that Berlin wanted Ukraine to fold and give in to Russia. Hebestreit told reporters: I’m tempted to switch to English and say it’s ‘utter nonsense’ what Boris Johnson said. Taking a swipe at the former prime minister, he added that Johnson has his “own relationship with the truth”. According to the Kyiv mayor, 21 of the 31 cruise missiles fired at the capital were intercepted. One of the 10 which evaded the defences hit an apartment block in Vyshgorod, a northern suburb of Kyiv, killing three people and wounding 15. There was a kindergarten in the lower ground floor of the building, but it was evacuated just in time after the air raid sirens went off. The blast left a 3 metre crater just in front of the building, destroying the apartments around it, blowing the tops off nearby trees and leaving a children’s playground a charred wreck filled with debris. “It flew right over us. We heard a whistling sound and then it came round down on the building,” Ruslan Vorona, a local resident, said. He and his eight-year-old son, Oleksii, were sheltering and charging their phones in an insulated tent set up by the emergency services. “There were a few explosions. Two were quieter and one was louder, and one of the missiles went straight over my head,” a 28-year-old local man, Oleksandr, who would not give his last name, said. Rescue workers were last night trying to salvage the remaining household possessions of the families left homeless by the blast, tying what they could find in sheets and throwing them to the ground from the four-storey brick building. There was not much left, but the emergency workers had made promises they would save what they could and they risked serious injury clambering through the wreckage to keep their word. The death toll from today’s Russian strikes across Ukraine has risen to seven, according to officials. Oleksii Kuleba, the head of Kyiv region military administration, said four people had died in the Kyiv region. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said at least three people had died after the attack on the capital. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head office of Ukraine’s president, said each new Russian attack “only strengthens our character”. The Kremlin “still does not know a damn thing about Ukraine” if it believes that power outages caused by Russian strikes will make Ukrainians “overthrow government and beg for mercy”, Podolyak wrote on Twitter. The UN’s security council will hold an urgent meeting later today on Russia’s latest strikes across Ukraine at the request of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. A spokesperson for the US mission to the UN said the US, Albania and Ukraine requested the meeting to discuss “Russia’s massive missile strikes today damaging critical civilian infrastructure across Ukraine”. The meeting is scheduled for 9pm UK time. The US has announced a new $400m (£332.5m) aid package to Ukraine which will include weapons, munitions and air defence equipment. In a statement, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said: The artillery ammunition, precision fires, air defence missiles, and tactical vehicles that we are providing will best serve Ukraine on the battlefield. The Pentagon said the package included additional munitions for Nasams air defence systems, high mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars), plus heavy machine guns with thermal imagery sights to counter Russian drones, and more than 20m rounds of small arms ammunition. The package also includes more than 200 generators to help Ukraine deal with power outages caused by Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. Pentagon press secretary, Brig Gen Pat Ryder, said the generators are “intended to support both civilian and military power needs … to ease the pressure on the grid”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, thanked President Joe Biden for the new package and vowed his country “will not be scared by cowardly inhumane terrorist attacks of Russian war criminals”. Two months after mobilising tens of thousands of Russian men, the Kremlin has said that Vladimir Putin will grant some of their mothers and wives an audience to quell fears over the mass call-up. But advocates for soldiers’ families have said they were passed over for the meeting and are expecting it to be a whitewash covering up the Kremlin’s disregard for its own soldiers fighting in Ukraine. Valentina Melnikova, a veteran advocate for soldiers’ families going back to 1989, said in an interview with the Guardian that she had not been approached about the meeting with Putin, which is expected to take place later this week. “Of course they didn’t invite us and we of course don’t want to go,” she said. She said it would be one thing to go alone and meet the Russian president as representative of the Soldiers’ Mothers Committee, which she says has received thousands of complaints, more than in the years of the Russian war in Chechnya. But she said that, like other rights activists who have not been chosen to take part in the meeting, she believed the Kremlin would handpick its representatives or perhaps even fill out their ranks with planted audience members, in order to stage Putin’s meeting with the “public”. To go together with the relatives of mobilised [soldiers] who are agreed to their husbands and sons dying on the front is not comfortable for us. We have somewhat different interests and different problems. Read the full story here: The head of Ukraine’s football association, who served on Fifa’s disciplinary body until 2020, has been accused of fraud and money laundering related to the construction of an artificial grass factory. Andriy Pavelko was served with papers by Ukraine’s national police on Tuesday, notifying him that he was suspected of abuse of power and conspiracy to misappropriate and launder funds. When approached by the Guardian, Pavelko, who has been president of the Ukrainian FA (UAF) since 2015, denied any wrongdoing. The UAF issued a statement in which it said that a previous national anti-corruption agency investigation had cleared Pavelko and other individuals. They accused pro-Russian forces of being behind the current investigation. The statement said: The real reason for the criminal pressure on the leadership of the UAF is the attempt of pro-Russian politicians to force the association to stop the fight against the Russian Federation, as well as to block the process of Ukraine’s preparation to participate in the role of organiser in the 2030 World Cup. Pavelko, who has been president of the Ukrainian FA since 2015, was photographed with his face covered as he emerged from the public prosecutor’s office in Kyiv on Tuesday. A leaked police document said Pavelko was suspected of “taking possession of someone else’s property by abuse of his official position as an official, committed on a particularly large scale by prior collusion by a group of persons”. Read the full story here: Russian forces launched 70 missiles at Ukraine in its latest “large-scale attack on crucial infrastructure facilities,” Ukraine’s armed forces said. Ukrainian defence forces shot down 51 of the Russian cruise missiles launched across the country today, as well as five attack drones, according to the top general Valeriy Zaluzhniy. A total of 21 out of 31 missiles targeting Kyiv were downed by defence forces, according to the capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukrainians are “unbreakable” after new Russian strikes across the country. Ukraine will rebuild infrastructure damaged by today’s attacks and “get through all of this”, he said in a video address posted to Telegram. Zelenskiy said: Today, the European parliament recognised Russia as a terrorist state … And then Russia proved that all this is true by using 67 missiles against our infrastructure, our energy grid, and ordinary people. He also said Ukraine will request an urgent meeting of the UN’s security council to discuss the latest Russian strikes against power-generating facilities. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said warned the Ukrainian capital faces “the worst winter since World War II” after Russian attacks on the city’s energy infrastructure. Residents in Kyiv had to be ready for the “worst case scenario” of widespread power cuts at low temperatures, he said in an interview with the German newspaper Bild. Parts of the capital would have to be evacuated in this scenario, he said. Klitschko said: We must also prepare for the worst scenario. That would be if there were widespread power cuts and the temperatures were even colder. Then parts of the city would have to be evacuated, but we don’t want it to come to that. He accused Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, of trying to intimate people and force them out of the city by ordering shelling on civilian infrastructure. He said: Putin wants to terrorise people, make them freeze, without light. But that won’t happen. My impression is that people will only get angrier, more determined. We will not die or flee as Putin wants. The head of the National Police of Ukraine, Ihor Klymenko, said six people were killed and 36 wounded following a fresh wave of Russian strikes across Ukraine. The actual number of casualties is expected to be higher, he added. The number of people injured in today’s missile attack in Kyiv has risen to nine, according to its mayor Vitali Klitschko. Three people were killed, he said. The International Rescue Committee has condemned an overnight Russian rocket attack that struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine, killing a newborn baby. In a statement, the IRC’s vice president for emergencies, Bob Kitchen, said this morning’s attack on the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia, was part of a “dangerous global trend of increasing attacks on health in conflict”. He said: The tragic images of rescuers working at the site of a maternity ward we saw this morning illustrate that women and children continue to pay the highest price for this war. No child should be born under a barrage of missile strikes. No child should die buried in rubble remaining from hospitals, where their mothers seek safety and protection. Health facilities are protected under international law and should be “safe havens in times of crisis and conflict”, he added. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian presidential office, has shared an image of 36 of his country’s servicemen who have returned after being held captive in Russia. Among those who were returned in a prisoner-of-war exchange with Russia were fighters at the Azovstal steelworks of the southern port city of Mariupol, he added. Here are some of the images we have received from the aftermath of the Russian missile strikes across Ukraine today. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm, Energoatom, has said power units of three Ukrainian nuclear power plants were switched off after Russian missile strikes across the country. In a statement, it said “due to a decrease in frequency in the energy system of Ukraine” emergency protection was activated at the Rivne, Pivdennoukrainsk and Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plants. Energoatom added: Currently, they (power units) work in project mode, without generation into the domestic energy system. The president of the European parliament, Roberta Metsola, has confirmed that it came under “sophisticated cyberattacks, hours after MEPs voted to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. A pro-Kremlin group has claimed responsibility for the denial of service attack on the European parliament’s website, she said. She added that IT experts were “pushing back” against the cyberattack and protecting their systems. She added: My response: #SlavaUkraini Boris Johnson’s claim that Germany wanted Ukraine to quickly “fold” after Russia’s invasion has been dismissed as “utter nonsense” by Berlin. PA media reports: The former prime minister, who was in office when Vladimir Putin’s troops invaded in February, said Germany wanted Ukraine to quickly lose, rather than have a lengthy war, for “all sorts of sound economic reasons”. But German government spokesperson, Steffen Hebestreit, on Wednesday sharply refuted his comment. “We know that the very entertaining former prime minister always has a unique relationship with the truth; this case is no exception,” he said, according to German media. Berlin swiftly decided to send arms to Ukraine after Moscow launched its invasion, chancellor Olaf Scholz’s spokesperson said, noting the “facts speak against [Johnson’s] claims”. Switching to English, Hebestreit added: “This is utter nonsense.” Germany’s ambassador to the UK tweeted the official’s rejection of Mr Johnson’s claim, which will not have helped UK-German relations. Johnson earlier told US broadcaster CNN: “The Germans, for all sorts of sound economic reasons, really didn’t want it to … I’ll tell you a terrible thing – the German view was at one stage that if it were going to happen, which would be a disaster, then it would be better for the whole thing to be over quickly and for Ukraine to fold. “I couldn’t support that. I thought that was a disastrous way of looking at it, but I could understand why they thought and felt as they did.” The ex-PM also said France was in denial “right up until the last moment” when Russian forces crossed the border. “This thing was a huge shock. We could see the Russian battalion tactical groups amassing but different countries had very different perspectives,” he said. “Be in no doubt that the French were in denial right up until the last moment.” This is from Miguel Berger, the German ambassador to the UK. For more live updates from the UK, do follow my colleague Andy Sparrow’s UK politics blog. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Dozens of Russian missiles were reportedly launched against Ukraine on Wednesday morning, with explosions heard in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Air raid alerts were heard across all over the country as Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, urged people to stay in shelters. At least three people have been killed – including a 17-year-old girl – and six injured after a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, according officials. Three people have died and at least 11 injured from the strikes, mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Oleksii Kuleba, head of the regional military administration, said the entire Kyiv region was without electricity after Moscow’s airstrikes targeted critical infrastructure. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, has said the entire western Ukrainian city is “without light” following Russian strikes. Sadovyi warned that there would be “interruptions” with the city’s water supply and that he was awaiting additional information from energy experts. Ukraine’s nuclear energy firm, Energoatom, reported that a number of units were shut down at the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. “Everything is fine with the station. There is nowhere to generate electricity,” a spokesperson said. Russian missile strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure caused blackouts across half of neighbouring Moldova, the deputy prime minister of Moldova said. Moldelectrica, the state-owned energy firm, is working to reconnect more than 50% of the country to electricity, Andrei Spînu, said. Moldova’s foreign affairs minister, Nicu Popescu, said he has asked for Russia’s ambassador to be summoned. A newborn baby was killed after an overnight Russian rocket attack struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s state emergency service said that a woman with her two-day-old baby and a doctor had been in the facility in the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia, that was destroyed. A Ukrainian security official has said suspected Russian citizens, cash and documents were seized in a raid on a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv and other Orthodox sites. The raid, which took place on Tuesday, was part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, said. The European parliament was hit by a cyber-attack, officials said, hours after it voted to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. In a non-binding resolution approved by a large majority of MEPs, the European parliament urged the EU’s 27 member states to make the same designation “with all the negative consequences this implies”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed the declaration. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog met a Russian delegation in Istanbul on Wednesday to discuss safety at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the watchdog said. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling at the weekend, leading to renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster. The UK is sending helicopters to Ukraine for the first time, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has announced. Three Sea King helicopters will be provided, with the first already in Ukraine, according to PA Media. Wallace also said an extra 10,000 artillery rounds were being sent to help Ukraine secure the territory it has recaptured from the invading forces in recent weeks. Russia has probably launched a number of Iranian manufactured uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) against Ukraine since September, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said. It’s also likely that Russia has nearly exhausted its current stock of Iran-made weapons and will seek resupply, the ministry said in its daily intelligence update. Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The European parliament was hit by a cyberattack, officials said, hours after it voted to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. Jaume Duch, a spokesperson for the EU parliament said its website was down due to a distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attack. Russia’s defence ministry said 35 prisoners of war who had been held captive in Ukraine were returned after talks. In a statement, it said: On November 23, as a result of the negotiation process, 35 Russian servicemen were returned from the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime, who were in mortal danger in captivity. The servicemen will be transported by air to Moscow “for treatment and rehabilitation at medical institutions of the Russian defence ministry”, it said. They will be given medical and psychological assistance, it added. A 17-year-old girl is among those killed in Russian airstrikes on Kyiv this afternoon, mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. Three people have died and at least 11 injured from the strikes, he said. A top Ukrainian security official has said that suspected Russian citizens and cash documents were seized in a raid on a 1,000-year-old Orthodox Christian monastery in Kyiv and other Orthodox sites early on Tuesday as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, said there was an ongoing investigation into what had been going on in the network of catacombs. The SBU website said the agency had found pro-Russian literature, over $100,000 in cash, and “dubious” Russian citizens. “We are not going to talk about money right now,” Danilov told the Guardian. There’s certain documents were found there. And certain citizens were found there … most likely citizens of the Russian federation. And now we’re trying to find out what they do in there and why they were there. Located south of the city centre, the sprawling Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex – or Kyiv Monastery of the Caves – is the headquarters of the Russian-backed wing of the Ukrainian Orthodox church that falls under the Moscow patriarchate, as well as being a Ukrainian cultural treasure and a Unesco world heritage site. The raid on Pechersk Lavra was part of a broad sweep of the church’s property. The SBU said in all, about 850 people had their identities checked and 50 underwent “in-depth counterintelligence interviews”, including with the use of a polygraph. More than 350 church buildings were searched including two other monasteries and the headquarters of the Moscow patriarchate’s diocese in western Ukraine, the agency said. Read the full story by my colleagues Julian Borger and Lorenzo Tondo here: Rescuers work at a site of a Russian missile strike, amid Russia’s attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv today. Moldova’s foreign affairs minister, Nicu Popescu, says he has asked for Russia’s ambassador to be summoned after strikes on Ukraine left his country “in the dark, again”. Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, has said the entire western Ukrainian city is “without light”. Sadovyi warned that there would be “interruptions” with the city’s water supply and that he was awaiting additional information from energy experts. Ukraine’s nuclear energy firm, Energoatom, has reported that a number of units were shut down at the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. An Energoatom spokesperson said: Everything is fine with the station. There is nowhere to generate electricity. At least three people have been killed and six injured after a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, according to the city administration. Oleksii Kuleba, head of the regional military administration, said the entire Kyiv region was without electricity after Moscow’s air strikes targeted critical infrastructure. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, also reported on Telegram that the city’s water supply had been cut off. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, has said Russia is trying to “punish Ukraine for daring to be free” by launching “cruel” new strikes across the country. America will stand with Ukraine, she said. Andrei Spînu, Moldova’s deputy prime minister, has reported “massive” power outages in his country following Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Moldelectrica, the state-owned energy firm, is working to reconnect more than 50% of the country to electricity, he added. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called for his country to get “all necessary air defence systems ASAP” after fresh Russian strikes across Ukraine. Moscow launched “new missile terror” against Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities to “celebrate” the European parliament’s recognition of Russia as a terrorist state, Kuleba said on Twitter. Authorities in Kyiv said at least one person was killed by the latest Russian attack on the capital. Another person was also injured by the strike, which damaged a two-storey building, according to the city’s military government. My colleague Lorenzo Tondo reports for us from Kyiv: According to preliminary information, in the Kyiv region, Russian strikes hit a residential area and critical infrastructure objects, said Ukrainian authorities. Explosions were also heard in Lviv and Kremenchuk, in the Poltava oblast. Power outages have been reported across Ukraine. An air raid alert was issued across Ukraine and Ukrainian media carried reports of air defence systems in action in several parts of the country. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Guardian correspondents in Kyiv heard several explosions. Emergency power outages began in Kyiv, a local energy provider said. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on the Telegram messaging app: (Missiles) Hit one of the capital’s infrastructure facilities. Stay in shelters! The air alert continues. He gave no details of what infrastructure was hit. But Russian forces have increasingly targeted Ukrainian critical infrastructure in recent weeks as they faced setbacks on the battlefield following their 24 February invasion. At least one person has been injured by the latest Russian attack on Kyiv, according to the city’s military administration. Russia has launched new missile strikes on Ukraine, hitting at least one critical infrastructure target in Kyiv with explosions heard echoing across the capital. An air raid alert was issued across the country. Ukrainian media reported air defence systems in action in several parts of the country. Vitaliy Kim, governor of the southern Mykolaiv oblast, said Russian forces had launched five missiles in the region. Explosions have also been reported in Lviv. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head office of Ukraine’s president, said a new “massive attack” on the country’s infrastructure facilities was under way. Emergency power outages began in Kyiv, a local energy provider said. Lviv’s mayor has also reported power outages in the whole of the city. My colleague Lorenzo Tondo reports from Kyiv: A series of explosions were heard in Kyiv a few minutes ago, as Russia has unleashed another wave of rockets across Ukraine. Explosions heard in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Some impacts have been reported. Ukraine’s air defence took out some of them. Mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, confirmed a strike on critical infrastructure. Explosions followed by power outages. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, has shared a video showing a Russian rocket flying over Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Post’s Jason Jay Smart has also posted a video reportedly showing missiles flying over Dnipro in central Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent’s Illia Ponomarenko writes that a Russian missile has just been heard over Bucha, in Kyiv Oblast. An air raid alert has been issued across almost all of Ukraine, according to reports. Officials in at least two Ukrainian regions said local air defences were in operation against Russian missiles, according to Reuters. A large number of Russian cruise missiles have been reported heading towards Kyiv, a Ukrainian military source has told Jimmy Rushton, a freelance security and foreign policy analyst. The European parliament has declared Russia “a terrorist regime” over its brutal war on Ukraine and called on democracies around the world to follow suit. In a non-binding resolution approved by a large majority of MEPs, the European parliament said Russia was “a terrorist regime as a consequence of its deliberate physical destruction of civilian infrastructure and mass murder of Ukrainian civilians with the aim of eliminating the Ukrainian people”. It urged the EU’s 27 member states to make the same designation “with all the negative consequences this implies”. The vote was passed by 494 MEPs, with 58 votes against and 44 abstentions. The parliament, which often takes bold foreign policy stances, cannot compel EU governments or the European Commission to follow its policy recommendations, which include changing EU law to allow states to be designated as a sponsor or perpetrator of terrorism. MEPs say this legal step would allow the EU to widen its sanctions against Russia, to target its political, legislative, military and executive bodies as well as holding it responsible for the crime of military aggression. MEPs have also called for Russia to be excluded from the UN security council. Since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, the EU has adopted sanctions against 1,241 individuals and 118 organisations, including Russian president Vladimir Putin, his leading ministers and allies, many Russian oligarchs and Russian Duma deputies. Five EU countries - Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltic states - have already declared Russia a state sponsor of terrorism, while the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe - which is not part of the EU - has also declared the current Russian regime “a terrorist one”. The resolution listed Russia’s “terrorist acts”, including supplying weapons to Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and deliberate atttacks on Syrian civilians; the poisoning of the Skripals and the downing of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014, which killed 298 people. In Ukraine, the resolution said that Ukrainian authorities had documented more than 34,000 war crimes committed by Russian and proxy troops. More than 90 % of these attacks were against civilian population and, or are with the aim of destroying civilian facilities. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has welcomed the decision by the European parliament to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. Russia must be “isolated at all levels” so that it will “end its long-standing policy of terrorism in Ukraine and across the globe”, he urged. Air raid alerts have been heard across all of Ukraine amid reports of explosions in southern and eastern regions of the country, according to Reuters. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, said Russia had launched another rocket attack and urged people to stay in shelters. More to follow. The European parliament has voted to designate Russia as a “state sponsor of terrorism”. In a largely symbolic vote, MEPs argued that Russia’s military strikes on civilian targets such as energy infrastructure, hospitals, schools and shelters violate international law. Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, said he was grateful to the European parliament for this “crucial step which strengthens the international isolation of Russia and rightfully confirms its pariah status” The European parliament’s vice-president, Dita Charanzová, called for President Vladimir Putin to be held accountable for his crimes. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest developments from Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines so far: An overnight rocket attack struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine, killing a newborn baby, Ukrainian authorities said on Wednesday. The child’s mother and a doctor were pulled alive from the rubble. The region’s governor said the rockets were Russian, AP reported. The strike in the city of Vilniansk adds to the gruesome toll suffered by hospitals and other medical facilities – and their patients and staff – in the Russian invasion entering its tenth month this week. The UK is sending helicopters to Ukraine for the first time, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has announced, in an escalation of support for Kyiv’s resistance against Vladimir Putin. Three Sea King helicopters will be provided, with the first already in Ukraine, according to PA Media. They are the first piloted aircraft to be sent by the UK since the Russian invasion began in February. Russia has probably launched a number of Iranian manufactured uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) against Ukraine since September, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said. It’s also likely that Russia has nearly exhausted its current stock of Iran-made weapons and will seek resupply, the ministry said in its daily intelligence update posted on Twitter. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog met a Russian delegation in Istanbul on Wednesday to discuss safety at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the watchdog said. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling at the weekend, leading to renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster, Reuters reported. The Russian foreign ministry criticised Ukraine as “godless”, “wild” and “immoral” on Wednesday for raiding an old Orthodox Christian Monastery in Kyiv. Ukraine’s SBU security service and police raided the 1,000-year-old Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex – or Kyiv Monastery of the Caves – early on Tuesday as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services,” the SBU said. Special “invincibility centres” will be set up around Ukraine to provide electricity, heat, water, internet, mobile phone connections and a pharmacy, free of charge and around the clock, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his nightly video address on Tuesday. Russian attacks have knocked out power for long periods for up to 10 million consumers at a time. Ukraine’s national power grid operator said on Tuesday the damage had been colossal. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has come under pressure to apologise after posting a video of himself at a football match wearing a scarf that depicted historical Hungary, including parts of Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said on Tuesday Kyiv would summon Hungary’s ambassador “who will be informed of the unacceptability of Viktor Orbán’s act”. Moldova will pay for gas withheld in Ukraine, Moldova’s deputy prime minister Andrei Spinu said on Wednesday. Accusing Ukraine of keeping volumes of gas that were destined for Moldova, Gazprom said it could start reducing gas supplies to Moldova via Ukraine from 28 November. The Group of Seven nations are set to soon announce the price cap on Russian oil exports and the coalition will probably adjust the level a few times a year rather than monthly, a senior US Treasury official said on Tuesday. The G7, including the United States, along with the EU and Australia are slated to implement the price cap on sea-borne exports of Russian oil on 5 December, as part of sanctions intended to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. In Crimea, Russian air defences were activated and two drone attacks were repelled on Tuesday, including one targeting a power station near Sevastopol, the regional governor said. Sevastopol is the home port of Russia’s Black Sea fleet. Russian-installed Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev called for calm and said no damage had been caused. I’ll be back in a few hours but my colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. The UK is sending helicopters to Ukraine for the first time, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has announced, in an escalation of support for Kyiv’s resistance against Vladimir Putin. Three Sea King helicopters will be provided, with the first already in Ukraine, according to PA Media. They are the first piloted aircraft to be sent by the UK since the Russian invasion began in February. “Our support for Ukraine is unwavering. These additional artillery rounds will help Ukraine to secure the land it has reclaimed from Russia in recent weeks,” Wallace said during a visit to Norway. The defence secretary also said an extra 10,000 artillery rounds were being sent to help Ukraine secure the territory it has recaptured from the invading forces in recent weeks. Pope Francis said on Wednesday that Ukrainians today were suffering from the “martyrdom of aggression” and compared the war to the “terrible genocide” of the 1930s, when Soviet leader Joseph Stalin inflicted famine on the people there. He was speaking at the end of his general audience before thousands of people in St Peter’s Square. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog met a Russian delegation in Istanbul on Wednesday to discuss safety at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the watchdog said. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling at the weekend, leading to renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster, Reuters reported. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling at the plant in recent months that has damaged buildings and knocked out power lines supplying the plant that are crucial to cooling the six reactors’ fuel and avoiding a nuclear meltdown. “IAEA Director General @rafaelmgrossi met a Russian delegation led by Rosatom DG Alexey Likhachev in Istanbul today, for consultations on operational aspects related to safety at #Zaporizhzhya NPP in Ukraine &amp; on urgently establishing a nuclear safety &amp; security protection zone,” the IAEA tweeted. Grossi has been warning for months of the risk of a potentially catastrophic accident because of the shelling. The nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on back-up generators a number of times. An overnight rocket attack struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine, killing a newborn baby, Ukrainian authorities said on Wednesday. The child’s mother and a doctor were pulled alive from the rubble. The region’s governor said the rockets were Russian, AP reported. The strike in the city of Vilniansk adds to the gruesome toll suffered by hospitals and other medical facilities – and their patients and staff – in the Russian invasion entering its tenth month this week. They have been in the line of fire from the outset, including a 9 March airstrike that destroyed a maternity hospital in the now-occupied port city of Mariupol. The Russian foreign ministry criticised Ukraine as “godless”, “wild” and “immoral” on Wednesday for raiding an old Orthodox Christian Monastery in Kyiv. Ukraine’s SBU security service and police raided the 1,000-year-old Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex – or Kyiv Monastery of the Caves – early on Tuesday as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services,” the SBU said. The site is a Ukrainian cultural treasure and the headquarters of the Russian-backed wing of the Ukrainian Orthodox church that falls under the Moscow Patriarchate, Reuters reported. The foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said there was no justification for the raid and compared the “Kyiv regime” to Bacchus, the Roman god of wine whose name is often associated in Russian with immoral mayhem, chaos and revelry. “This is just some kind of total godless Bacchanalia. There is no justification or explanation for this. And there cannot be,” Zakharova said on Sputnik radio. “This is another part of the absolutely immoral and wild actions of the Kyiv regime.” Russia’s Orthodox church said on Tuesday the search was an “act of intimidation”. Russia has probably launched a number of Iranian manufactured uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) against Ukraine since September, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said. It’s also likely that Russia has nearly exhausted its current stock of Iran-made weapons and will seek resupply, the ministry said in its daily intelligence update posted on Twitter. The Russian attacks have been a combination of UAVs and traditional reusable armed systems, it added. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. My colleague Tom Ambrose will take you through the rest of the day’s news. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has come under pressure to apologise after posting a video of himself at a football match wearing a scarf that depicted historical Hungary, including parts of Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said on Tuesday Kyiv would summon Hungary’s ambassador “who will be informed of the unacceptability of Viktor Orbán’s act”. “The promotion of revisionism ideas in Hungary does not contribute to the development of Ukrainian-Hungarian relations and does not comply with the principles of European policy,” Nikolenko wrote on Facebook. “We are waiting for an official apology from the Hungarian side and a refutation of the encroachments on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.” Ukrainian media showed images of Orbán meeting a Hungarian footballer wearing a scarf which the outlet Ukrainska Pravda reported depicted a map of “Greater Hungary” including territory that is now part of the neighbouring states of Ukraine, Austria, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia and Serbia. Romania’s foreign ministry also responded angrily, saying it had submitted to the Hungarian ambassador in Bucharest its “firm disapproval of the gesture: Special “invincibility centres” will be set up around Ukraine to provide electricity, heat, water, internet, mobile phone connections and a pharmacy, free of charge and around the clock, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his nightly video address on Tuesday. Russian attacks have knocked out power for long periods for up to 10 million consumers at a time. Ukraine’s national power grid operator said on Tuesday the damage had been colossal. “If massive Russian strikes happen again and it’s clear power will not be restored for hours, the ‘invincibility centres’ will go into action with all key services,” Zelenskiy said. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said this week that 8,500 power generator sets are being imported to Ukraine daily. The first snow of the winter has fallen in much of the country over the past week. Authorities have warned of power cuts that could affect millions of people to the end of March – the latest impact from Russia’s nine-month invasion that has already killed tens of thousands, uprooted millions and pummelled the global economy. Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities follow a series of battlefield setbacks that have included a retreat of its forces from the southern city of Kherson to the east bank of the Dnipro River that bisects the country. The Ministry of Defence has announced it will send helicopters to Ukraine for the first time since the war began. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said it will be the first time piloted aircraft were sent to the war-torn nation since Russia’s invasion. According to the BBC, three former Sea King helicopters will be provided. The first of which has already arrived in Ukraine. Wallace, who made the announcement from Oslo where he is meeting allies to discuss ongoing military support for Kyiv, added that the UK will also send an additional 10,000 artillery rounds. It comes after Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, used a visit to the Ukrainian capital to set out a new 50m package of defence aid which included 125 anti-aircraft guns and equipment to counter Iranian-supplied drones. Moldova will pay for gas withheld in Ukraine, Moldova’s deputy prime Minister Andrei Spinu said on Wednesday. Accusing Ukraine of keeping volumes of gas that were destined for Moldova, Gazprom said it could start reducing gas supplies to Moldova via Ukraine from 28 November. “Gazprom accuses Ukraine and Moldova of something that is not happening. All gas supplied to the right bank of Moldova will be paid by Moldova,” Spinu said on messaging app Telegram.” Here are photos of the aftermath of the attack, posted by Zaporizhzhia governor Oleksandr Staruk, via the Kyiv Independent: Zaporizhzhia governor Oleksandr Starukh said on Telegram in the early hours of Wednesday morning that a Russian missile strike on a maternity ward in the Zaporizhzhia oblast city of Vilniansk has killed a newborn baby. “Grief fills our hearts,” he said. Hello, this is the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next while. Zaporizhzhia governor Oleksandr Starukh said on Telegram in the early hours of Wednesday morning that a Russian missile strike on a maternity ward in the Zaporizhzhia oblast city of Vilniansk has killed a newborn baby. “Grief fills our hearts,” he said. The Guardian has not been able to verify the claim independently, but if true, it would not be the first strike by Russian forces on maternity wards in Ukraine. In March, Russian bombs destroyed a children’s and maternity hospital in Mariupol, killing three people and injuring 17. A pregnant woman who was in the hospital when it was attacked died later, after being taken to another hospital, as did her baby. We’ll have more on the strike in Zaporizhzhia as it comes in. In the mean time, here are the other key recent developments: The Group of Seven nations are set to soon announce the price cap on Russian oil exports and the coalition will probably adjust the level a few times a year rather than monthly, a senior US Treasury official said on Tuesday. The G7, including the United States, along with the EU and Australia are slated to implement the price cap on sea-borne exports of Russian oil on 5 December, as part of sanctions intended to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainians needing basic services if Russia knocks out power stations and other facilities this winter can turn to special “invincibility centres,” president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday. Thousands of centres spread across the country will offer electricity, heat, water, internet service, mobile phone connections and a pharmacy, free of charge and around the clock. Ukrainians are likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, the head of a major energy provider said, as the government started free evacuations for people in Kherson to other regions. Kyiv will summon the Hungarian ambassador to protest that prime minister Viktor Orbán went to a football match wearing a scarf depicting some Ukrainian territory as part of Hungary, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said on Tuesday. Ukrainian media showed images of Orbán meeting a Hungarian footballer wearing a scarf which the outlet Ukrainska Pravda said depicted a map of “Greater Hungary” including territory that is now part of the neighbouring states of Austria, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia, Serbia and Ukraine. Russia’s Gazprom has threatened to cut its gas flows to Europe via Ukraine as early as next week. In a statement, the Russian state-owned energy giant said some gas flows being kept in Ukraine were actually meant for Moldova, and accused Kyiv of obstructing the delivery of 52.52m cubic metres from transiting to Moldova. In Crimea, Russian air defences were activated and two drone attacks were repelled on Tuesday, including one targeting a power station near Sevastopol, the regional governor said. Sevastopol is the home port of Russia’s Black Sea fleet. Russian-installed Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev called for calm and said no damage had been caused. The Polish president spoke to a hoax caller pretending to be France’s Emmanuel Macron on the night that a missile hit a village near the Ukrainian border, his office has admitted. “Emmanuel, believe me, I am extra careful,” Duda tells the caller in a recording of the call posted on the internet. “I don’t want to have war with Russia and believe me, I am extra careful, extra careful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/19/poland-could-send-leopard-tanks-to-ukraine-without-german-approval","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-20T00:17:53Z","webTitle":"Poland could send Leopard tanks to Ukraine without German approval","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/19/poland-could-send-leopard-tanks-to-ukraine-without-german-approval","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/19/poland-could-send-leopard-tanks-to-ukraine-without-german-approval","fields":{"headline":"Poland could send Leopard tanks to Ukraine without German approval","bodyText":"The Polish prime minister has said his country would be willing to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine without securing Germany’s approval if Berlin does not agree to their re-export at Friday’s meeting of western defence ministers at Ramstein airbase. Mateusz Morawiecki said in a radio interview on Thursday that “consent was of secondary importance” when it came to German-made tanks, because the key issue was to get military aid to Ukraine urgently. “We will either obtain this consent quickly, or we will do it ourselves,” Morawiecki added, heaping further pressure on Berlin to allow German made Leopard 2s to be sent to Ukraine in preparation for a spring offensive. His comments came as the US Defense Department formally announced new military assistance for Ukraine valued at up to $2.5bn, including armoured vehicles and support for Ukraine’s air defence. The aid includes 59 Bradley fighting vehicles and 90 Stryker armoured personnel carriers, but not Abrams tanks. Poland, along with Finland, has said it wants to give 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, which would normally require German approval, but it is one of a number of countries trying to force the pace at a time when Berlin is still negotiating. Arvydas Anusauskas, Lithuania’s defence minister, said others could follow suit at the Ramstein meeting on Friday. “Some of the countries will definitely send Leopard tanks to Ukraine, that is for sure,” he said. Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, met his newly appointed German counterpart, Boris Pistorius, in Berlin on Thursday, but neither mentioned the Leopard standoff in brief commentsbefore their meeting. Previously, German officials signalled Berlin was willing to break the logjam if the US would also agree to send over some of its own Abrams tanks to Ukraine. But the US said on Wednesday it did not want to do that, because the Abrams, which has a jet turbine engine, is fuel inefficient and so requires complex logistics support. Colin Kahl, the US undersecretary of defence for policy, said: “The Abrams tank is a very complicated piece of equipment. It’s expensive, it’s hard to train on, it has a jet engine – I think it’s about three gallons to the mile with jet fuel. It is not the easiest system to maintain.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said for the second time in two days there was little time to be wasted wrestling with decisions. Speaking by video link at a special event at the Davos gathering of the global elite, he said: “This is not a cinema where you wait for the film to start.” Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, however, warned that if Russia was to be defeated in a conventional war in Ukraine, it could lead to nuclear war. “The defeat of a nuclear power in a conventional war may trigger a nuclear war,” he wrote, adding: “Nuclear powers have never lost major conflicts on which their fate depends.” Few believe such rhetoric should be taken at face value, Russian nuclear messaging is usually designed to intimidate or provoke anxiety in the west just as leaders weigh up how much military aid to provide to Ukraine this week. But there was little sign of hesitation among many western nations, putting the focus squarely on Germany. Britain, which has already said it will supply 14 of its own Challenger 2 tanks, said it would provide an extra 600 Brimstone anti-tank missiles, at a pre-meeting of nine countries in Estonia. “We’re in it for the long haul,” said Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary. The grouping, which includes Poland and the Baltic states as well as Britain, released a joint pledge declaring: “We commit to collectively pursuing delivery of an unprecedented set of donations including main battle tanks, heavy artillery, air defence, ammunition, and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine’s defence.” Estonia announced a military aid package worth €113m and said the total value of its support was more than 1% of its GDP in the period since the war began. Sweden said it would donate 50 Type 90 infantry fighting vehicles and Archer artillery. Denmark announced it will donate 19 French-made Caesar howitzers. France, too, hinted it might consider sending its Leclerc tanks to Ukraine as part of an arrangement with Germany. “The subject is complicated and hasn’t been settled yet in Paris. But we are thinking about it,” a French official told Politico. It could be discussed at a joint Franco-German cabinet on Sunday, they suggested."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/mar/04/starmer-calls-on-tories-to-sack-co-chair-ben-elliot","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T17:20:19Z","webTitle":"Starmer calls on Tories to sack co-chair Ben Elliot over party links to Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/04/starmer-calls-on-tories-to-sack-co-chair-ben-elliot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/mar/04/starmer-calls-on-tories-to-sack-co-chair-ben-elliot","fields":{"headline":"Starmer calls on Tories to sack co-chair Ben Elliot over party links to Russia","bodyText":"Keir Starmer has called on the Conservatives to sack their co-chair, Ben Elliot, for being “at the heart” of links between the party and Russian money. The Labour leader said Elliot should step back from his role or be removed after revelations about his firm’s Russian business and the Tories accepting donations from wealthy Russians or companies linked to Russia. Elliot has been chair of the party while it has taken donations from Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of Vladimir Putin’s former finance minister, and Aquind, a company co-owned by the billionaire Viktor Fedotov. Neither is subject to any sanctions and the Conservatives have previously said in relation to Chernukhin and Aquind that all donations were “properly and transparently” declared in line with electoral law. Chernukhin, who has British citizenship, has condemned the invasion of Ukraine and called Putin’s regime “despotic”. Elliot is also co-owner of Quintessentially, a “concierge” service for the super-wealthy that has counted many Russians among its clients, including reportedly Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner who has also faced calls from Starmer for UK sanctions to be imposed on him. Quintessentially this week deleted a webpage detailing its presence in Russia, with about 50 staff in the country. An archived page version said: “Quintessentially Russia has nearly 15 years’ experience providing luxury lifestyle management services to Russia’s elite and corporate members. Our office employs over 50 lifestyle managers, each of whom has completed a specialised training programme. They work around the clock 365 days per year to provide personal concierge services to each member. From restaurant bookings to backstage concert access, a bespoke luxury lifestyle is at our clients’ fingertips.” A spokesperson for Quintessentially said the group “completely condemns President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine” and was monitoring its member base to ensure it was not servicing any individual or corporate body on sanctions lists, confirming that there were none so far. With concerns heightened after the invasion of Ukraine, Starmer said it was time for the Conservatives to act to remove Elliot. Speaking during a visit to Birmingham Erdington, where Labour won a byelection on Thursday, Starmer said: “I think there is growing concern about the links between the Conservative party and Russian money. Ben Elliot is at the heart of that. We need to strip Russian money away from our politics, not to allow it to influence our politics. “There will always be this danger if the Conservative government doesn’t go really hard on this that people will say it must be because you are reliant on Russian money that you are not going more quickly. “So, it’s in everybody’s best interests that Ben Elliot steps back from his role – and I think he should actually be sacked from it.” A Conservative source said: “This Conservative government has been leading the world in arming and training Ukrainian troops and imposing severe sanctions on Russia while Keir Starmer attempts to score cheap political points.” In a reference to a row over support for Stop the War, the source added: “He would be better off trying to rid his own party of the Putin apologists who blame Nato for the invasion of Ukraine, many of whom sit as Labour MPs.” Abramovich has said he is a non-political person and was not linked to Putin or the Russian state. Meanwhile the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith called for British politics to be “scrubbed clean” of Russian money, saying: “It’s all political parties: we’ve all got to clean house … I think it should all be revisited, all of what went on in the past.” Duncan Smith suggested it was not just politicians who had been too lax about accepting Russian cash but also “lawyers, estate agents, accountants – enablers” who should now reconsider their roles. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, called on the government to use legislation due to be passed next week to force UK citizens to sever their links with Russian companies if the government believed they were connected to the Kremlin. “We are in an economic war,” he said. “One of the things we should do in the economic crime bill is that we should require British citizens not to hold posts on the boards of companies which the government believes have a link with Putin. They should certainly not be in receipt of large sums of money from such companies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/27/russia-ukraine-war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-situation-still-very-risky-says-zelenskiy-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-27T17:15:56Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: risk of radioactive leak at ‘repeatedly shelled’ Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, operator warns – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/27/russia-ukraine-war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-situation-still-very-risky-says-zelenskiy-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/27/russia-ukraine-war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-situation-still-very-risky-says-zelenskiy-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: risk of radioactive leak at ‘repeatedly shelled’ Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, operator warns – as it happened","bodyText":"Concern about the potential for a radiation leak at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is persisting.

Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling the area around Europe’s largest nuclear plant. Moscow’s troops have “repeatedly shelled” the site of the nuclear plant over the past day, the Ukrainian state nuclear company, Energoatom, said. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed Ukraine’s troops “shelled the territory of the station three times” in the past day. A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog is poised to make an emergency visit to the Zaporizhzhia plant, according to reports. Sources have told the Wall Street Journal it is “almost certain” that a mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency will visit the plant early next week, although details are still being finalised. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has issued a statement marking Ukraine’s Aviation Day, in which he pledged that Kyiv’s troops will “destroy the occupiers’ potential step by step”. The Ukrainian president vowed that the Russian “invaders will die like dew on the sun”. Russia has probably increased the intensity of its attacks in the Donetsk area of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region over the past five days, according to British intelligence. Pro-Russia separatists have most likely made progress towards the centre of Pisky village, near Donetsk airport, but Russian forces overall had secured few territorial gains, the latest report from the UK Ministry of Defence says. Russia has blocked an agreement at the UN that was aimed at bolstering the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). The failure to agree to a joint statement, due to Moscow’s objection to a clause about control over the Zaporizhzhia power plant, is the latest blow to hopes of maintaining an arms control regime and keeping a lid on a rekindled arms race. Ukrainian sailors will be allowed to leave the country for work, the country’s cabinet of ministers has said. The prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said men of draft age employed as crew members will be allowed to leave the country so long as they have permission from their local conscription offices to cross the border. Britain’s defence ministry has said it is giving six underwater drones to Ukraine to help clear its coastline of mines and make grain shipments safer. In addition, dozens of Ukrainian navy personnel will be taught to use the drones over the coming months, the ministry said. Kazakhstan, a neighbour and ally of Russia, has suspended all arms exports for a year, its government said, amid the conflict in Ukraine and western sanctions against Moscow. Poland and the Czech Republic have agreed to protect the airspace of their Nato ally Slovakia, as it upgrades its air force from legacy Soviet-made MiG-29 fighters to a new batch of F-16 jets from the US. UK organisations have been urged to strengthen their cyber defences to prepare for an extended period of “heightened threat” due to the war in Ukraine. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) published the guidance along with advice to help companies bolster their protections. Paul Maddinson, NCSC director for national resilience and strategy, said: “From the start of the conflict in Ukraine, we have been asking organisations to strengthen their cyber defences to help keep the UK secure, and many have done so. “But it’s now clear that we’re in this for the long haul, and it’s vital that organisations support their staff through this demanding period of heightened cyber threat.” The UK is giving underwater drones to Ukraine and training Ukrainian personnel in Britain to use them to clear their coastline of mines, the Ministry of Defence has announced. Dozens of Ukrainian personnel will be taught to use the autonomous minehunting vehicles by the Royal Navy and US partners over the coming months, with some already commencing their training. Six autonomous minehunting vehicles are being sent to search for Russian mines in the waters off its coast. Three vehicles are due to be sent from UK stocks while another three will be bought from industry. The lightweight autonomous vehicles can be used in shallow coastal environments and are designed to operate at depths of up to 100 metres to detect, locate and identify mines with a series of sensors. Kazakhstan, a neighbour and ally of Russia, has suspended all arms exports for a year, its government said, amid conflict in Ukraine and western sanctions against Moscow. The former Soviet republic – which also has active economic ties with Kyiv – has avoided taking sides in the Ukrainian crisis while calling for its peaceful resolution. The country’s government did not give a reason in Saturday’s statement for the decision to halt arms exports, Reuters reports. Kazakhstan produces a wide range of military equipment including boats, armoured and artillery vehicles, machine guns, night visors, grenades, torpedoes and protective gear. The government has not said these items were being exported. Poland and the Czech Republic have agreed to protect the airspace of their Nato ally Slovakia, as it upgrades its air force from legacy Soviet-made MiG-29 fighters to a new batch of F-16 jets from the US. The agreement is due to come into effect at the beginning of September and will last a year and a half, the defence ministers of the countries agreed at a meeting during the Slovak International Air Fest. Slovakia has expressed a willingness to transfer the grounded planes to Ukraine but the defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said no deal had been reached with Kyiv. Nad said: “The possibility is on the table, and once there is an agreement we will inform you.” The woods outside Chernihiv were quiet in late August when Anatoliy Pavelko scrambled into a 10-metre bomb crater with a trowel and an icebox full of sample jars. He wanted to find out what the Russian FAB-250 bomb left behind when it carved this gaping hole into the ground in the spring. Four months earlier, the environmental lawyer was dug in on a frontline just a few kilometres away, shells crashing around him in the bitter fight to keep Russian forces out of Kyiv. Now he has taken temporary leave from his unit of volunteers and returned to Chernihiv for a more familiar battle on a different front in the war against Moscow. Russia’s invasion has killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians and destroyed homes and entire cities. It is also devastating Ukraine’s environment, an “ecocide” that activists worry is going largely unrecorded amid the broader national tragedy. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Concern about the potential for a radiation leak at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is persisting.

A Russian rocket hit Kharkiv’s historic district in the early hours of Saturday, leaving one person injured, according to police. The rocket damaged nearby buildings, leaving a large crater in the road. A local police officer told Reuters: There are no military objects, no military equipment. Only residential buildings with regular citizens near the place of impact. Tetiana Zviahintseva, a local shopkeeper who was sweeping scattered shards of broken glass in her store, said: Horror and nightmare – they [Russians] torture our city. The endless shelling exhausted everybody. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has issued a statement marking the country’s Aviation Day, in which he pledged that Kyiv’s troops will “destroy the occupiers’ potential step by step”. On Telegram, the Ukrainian leader posted a series of photos dedicated to the country’s air force and vowed that the Russian “invaders will die like dew on the sun”. Zelenskiy said: Ukrainian soldiers will destroy the occupiers’ potential step by step, and the day will come when the enemy will perish in Zaporizhzhia, in the south, in the east of the country, and in Crimea. The invaders will die like dew on the sun, and our defence is and will be this sun. Happy Ukraine Aviation Day! • This post was amended on 30 August 2022 to provide a link to President Zelenskiy’s statement on Telegram. Ukraine’s military command said its forces have beaten back assaults by Russian forces around Soledar, Zaitseve and Mayorsk in the Donetsk region. Ukraine’s southern military command reported that a Ukrainian air strike destroyed a Russian air defence system in the Kherson region, while the Antonovsky and Daryivskiy bridges remained unusable by heavy vehicles after previous strikes, Reuters reports. In its daily briefing the Russian defence ministry said it had destroyed a large ammunition depot in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region that had contained US-made Himars rocket systems and shells for M777 howitzers, Reuters reports. The Russian air force also claims to have shot down a MiG-29 aircraft in the eastern Donetsk region and to have destroyed another six missile and artillery weapons depots in the Donetsk, Mykolaiv and Kherson regions. Reuters reports two South Korean companies have signed a $5.76bn contract with Poland to export tanks and howitzers, Seoul’s arms procurement agency said. This comes after Warsaw agreed to ramp up arms imports amid tensions with Russia. Ukrainian sailors will be allowed to leave the country for work, the Kyiv Independent reports. The cabinet of ministers of Ukraine has announced that sailors will be allowed to travel abroad for work. The prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said men of draft age employed as crew members will be allowed to leave the country so long as they have permission to cross the border from their local conscription offices. Until now, men aged 18 to 60 who were capable of military service were not allowed to travel outside Ukraine. According to Shmyhal, more than 100,000 Ukrainians work in the shipping industry Ukrainian sailors have been working to encourage the authorities to release them to work abroad, with some sailors recording videos with their wives and children with messages for Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, requesting the right to work overseas. From 1 September, sailors will be allowed to leave Ukraine for business trips for up to seven days. Ukraine’s state energy operator has warned that there is a risk of a radioactive leak at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Moscow’s troops have “repeatedly shelled” the site of the nuclear plant over the past day, Energoatom said. As of midday on Saturday local time (9am GMT) the plant “operates with the risk of violating radiation and fire safety standards”, the operator said in a statement. Energoatom said: As a result of periodic shelling, the infrastructure of the station has been damaged, there are risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is high. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed Ukraine’s troops “shelled the territory of the station three times” in the past day. Hungary has issued regulatory approval for the construction of two new nuclear reactors by the Russian state-owned company Rosatom, Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, announced yesterday. The £10.6bn construction of two nuclear reactors will begin in the coming weeks, as part of a 2014 deal between Moscow and Budapest aimed at expanding Hungary’s existing Paks nuclear plant. Szijjártó said on Facebook: This is a big step, an important milestone. We can now move from planning stage to construction. You’ll see that at the Paks site in the coming weeks. He added it is “realistic” that the new reactors could enter service by 2030. Russia’s nuclear industry has not been included in EU sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, and the fact that the construction is moving forward has been seen as another sign of the close ties between Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, and Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Ukraine’s state nuclear company, Energoatom, has claimed Russian forces shelled the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant complex in southern Ukraine. In a statement, Energoatom said: Over the last [24 hours], Russian troops again shelled the grounds of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The damage is currently being ascertained. Russia’s defence ministry earlier accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the nuclear plant complex three times in the last 24 hours. It is not possible to verify either side’s claims. On Friday, Energoatom said Ukrainian technicians had managed to partly reconnect the Zaporizhzhia plant to its grid under the gaze of occupying forces. The situation, however, remains fragile as fighting continues around the plant. My colleague Shaun Walker has been reporting on the propaganda drive in Russian-occupied Kherson that Russia hopes will help cement its hold over the southern Ukrainian city. Russian authorities have resurrected the Soviet-era newspaper Naddnepryanskaya Pravda, which now claims to have a print run of 250,000. The newspaper’s content gives a good insight into the propaganda priorities for the Russian administration, Shaun writes. There are repeated articles promising residents increased benefits, pensions and more work opportunities. There are repeated claims of the “overwhelming desire” of Kherson residents to hold a referendum to join Russia, but there are also plenty of threats. One front page article warns of “tough measures” against those who threaten public order, indicating that speaking out against Russian rule is now considered to be against the law. Here’s some more detail on the British defence ministry’s announcement that it is donating undersea minehunter drones to help Ukraine clear its coastline. Six autonomous minehunting vehicles will be sent to the country to help detect Russian mines in the waters off its coast, the ministry said. Three of these drones will be provided from the UK’s own stocks, with a further three to be purchased from industry. In addition, dozens of Ukrainian navy personnel will be taught to use the drones over the coming months, the ministry said. The first tranche have already begun their training, it added. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said in a statement: Russia’s cynical attempts to hold the world’s food supply to ransom must not be allowed to succeed. This vital equipment and training will help Ukraine make their waters safe, helping to smooth the flow of grain to the rest of the world and supporting the armed forces of Ukraine as they look to defend their coastline and ports. Britain’s defence ministry has said it is giving six underwater drones to Ukraine to help clear its coastline of mines and make grain shipments safer. Britain will also train dozens of Ukrainian navy personnel to use the drones, the ministry said in a statement. A US citizen has recently died in Ukraine, according to a state department spokesperson. Officials are in touch with the family and are providing consular assistance, they added. The spokesperson added: We also once again reiterate US citizens should not travel to Ukraine due to the active armed conflict and the singling out of US citizens in Ukraine by Russian government security officials, and that US citizens in Ukraine should depart immediately if it is safe to do so using any commercial or other privately available ground transportation options. Two civilians have been killed and 12 others injured by Russian forces in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, according to officials. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor, wrote on Facebook: On August 26, Russians killed two civilians in Donetsk region – in Bakhmut. Twelve people were injured. Note: It has not been possible to independently verify this information. Russia has blocked an agreement at the United Nations that was aimed at bolstering the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) because Moscow objected to a clause about control over the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine. The failure to agree to a joint statement after four weeks of debate and negotiation among 151 countries at the UN in New York is the latest blow to hopes of maintaining an arms control regime and keeping a lid on a rekindled arms race. The closing session was put off for more than four hours over Russia’s refusal to agree to a lengthy statement of support for the NPT which included a reference to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is occupied by Russian forces close to the frontline in Ukraine’s south-east. Alarm was raised on Thursday when the plant was temporarily cut off from the Ukrainian electricity grid but the connection was restored. Russian forces are reportedly planning to sever the plant more permanently from the grid, raising concerns of a possible disaster. A paragraph in the final draft text on Friday stressed “the paramount importance of ensuring control by Ukraine’s competent authorities of nuclear facilities … such as the Zaporizhzia nuclear power plant”. The Russian delegation was the only one to speak against the agreed text, but blamed the breakdown of the conference on Ukraine and its “protectors”, calling the negotiations a “one-sided game”. After delivering its statement, the Russian delegation walked out of the UN chamber. Read the full article here. French energy firm TotalEnergies says it is divesting its stake in a Russian gas field that was reported this week to be providing fuel that ends up in Russian fighter jets. The company said it had signed a deal on Friday with its local Russian partner, Novatek, to sell its 49% in the Termokarstovoye gas field “on economic terms enabling TotalEnergies to recover the outstanding amounts invested in the field”. Agence France-Presse reported it saying Russian authorities approved the divestment on 25 August. That was the day after an article appeared in French daily Le Monde reporting on the alleged refining of natural gas condensates from Termokarstovoye into jet fuel for fighter-bombers involved in Russia’s assault on Ukraine since February. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has stressed the need to boost security along the alliance’s northern flank to counter Russia, as he concluded a visit to Canada that included a tour of its Arctic defences. “The high north is strategically important for Euro-Atlantic security,” Agence France Presse reported Stoltenberg as telling a news conference at an air base in Alberta. With Finland and Sweden joining Nato, he noted, seven of eight Arctic states would be members. Referring to the North American aerospace defence command (Norad), a US-Canadian organisation, Stoltenberg said: The shortest path to North America for Russian missiles and bombers would be over the North Pole. This makes Norad’s role vital for North America and therefore also for Nato. Stoltenberg said Russia’s capabilities in the far north “are a strategic challenge for the whole alliance”, citing a significant Russian military buildup in the region. That included the reopening of “hundreds of new and former Soviet-era Arctic military sites” and its use of the high north “as a testbed for the most advanced weapons including hypersonic missiles”. The Nato chief also expressed concerns about China’s reach into the Arctic for shipping and resources exploration, with plans to build the world’s largest icebreaker fleet. Beijing and Moscow have pledged to intensify practical cooperation in the Arctic. This forms part of the deepening strategic partnership that challenges our values and our interests. The governor of the Donetsk region says three-quarters of its population has been evacuated amid Russian assaults in Ukraine’s east. Pavlo Kyrylenko told Ukrainian TV: There is practically not a single major town or city that is not subject to [Russian] shelling. Reuters also reported the Ukrainian military general staff as saying Russian aircraft had attacked several sites and was focusing on more than a dozen towns in the south, including Mykolaiv near the Black Sea. There were also air strikes against several towns in the Sumy region near the Russian border, the general staff said, and Russian forces had shelled and carried out air attacks against the Kharkiv region in the north-east. Also on Friday, Washington confirmed reports that a US citizen had recently died in Ukraine, but declined to provide further details. Russia has probably increased the intensity of its attacks in the Donetsk area of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region over the past five days, according to British intelligence. Pro-Russia separatists have most likely made progress towards the centre of Pisky village, near Donetsk airport, but Russian forces overall had secured few territorial gains, the latest report from the UK Ministry of Defence says. It adds: There is a realistic possibility that Russia has increased its efforts in the Donbas in an attempt to draw in or fix additional Ukrainian units, amid speculation that Ukraine is planning a major counter-offensive. Ukraine suspects Moscow intends to divert power from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed by Russian troops in 2014. Washington warned on Thursday against such a move, with State Department spokesman Vedant Patel saying attempts to redirect power to occupied areas were “unacceptable”. The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine. Agence France-Presse also reported that Britain’s defence ministry said satellite imagery showed an increased presence of Russian troops at the occupied power plant in south-eastern Ukraine, with armoured personnel carriers deployed within 60m (200 feet) of one reactor. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Adam Fulton and here are the latest developments as it has just passed 9am in Kyiv on this Saturday 27 August 2022. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remained “very risky” after two of its six reactors were reconnected to the grid following shelling that caused Europe’s largest nuclear power plant to be disconnected for the first time in its history. “Let me stress that the situation remains very risky and dangerous,” he said in his regular evening address on Friday, praising Ukrainian experts working to “avert the worst-case scenario”. Residents near the Zaporizhzhia plant have reportedly been given iodine tablets amid mounting fears that the fighting around the Russian-occupied complex in south-eastern Ukraine could trigger a catastrophe. Zelenskiy said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” on Thursday when electricity to the Zaporizhzhia plant was cut for hours after fires broke out around it. A team of inspectors from the United Nations nuclear watchdog are poised to make an emergency visit to the Zaporizhzhia plant, according to reports. Sources have told the Wall Street Journal it is “almost certain” that a mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency will visit the plant early next week, although details are still being completed. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has announced plans to expand mandatory evacuations for civilians living on the war’s frontlines. Speaking on national television, she said evacuating women with children and elderly people would be a priority from some districts of the eastern Kharkiv region, and the southern Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv regions. Ukrainian forces have struck an important bridge used by Russian occupying forces in the southern Kherson region, according to Ukraine’s southern military command. The Daryivskiy Bridge is the only Russian-controlled crossing across the Inhulets river, which splits the Russian-occupied land west of the Dnipro into two parts. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, an ally of President Vladimir Putin, said in a French television interview on Friday that Russia was prepared to hold talks with Volodymyr Zelenskiy subject to certain conditions, but warned Moscow would not stop its assault until its goals had been achieved. “Renouncing [Ukraine’s] participation in the North Atlantic alliance is now vital, but it is already insufficient in order to establish peace,” Medvedev told LCI television in quotes reported by Russian news agencies. EU energy ministers will gather for an urgent meeting as soon as possible to discuss the energy crisis following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Czech prime minister said. The Czech Republic currently holds the presidency of the European Council. Russia’s claim that it is deliberately slowing the pace of its military campaign in Ukraine is “almost certainly deliberate misinformation”, according to British intelligence. The latest UK Ministry of Defence report said Russia’s offensive had stalled “because of poor Russian military performance and fierce Ukrainian resistance”. The Belarusian president has said his country’s SU-24 warplanes have been re-fitted to carry nuclear armaments. Alexander Lukashenko said he had previously agreed to the move with his Russian counterpart, Putin, and warned that his country was ready to respond to “serious provocation” from the west instantly. Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas that it would previously have exported to Germany while energy costs soar in Europe, the BBC has reported. According to the broadcaster, which cites an analysis by Rystad Energy, a plant near Russia’s border with Finland is burning an estimated £8.4m worth of gas every day. The head of the UK’s energy regulator, Ofgem, has blamed Russia for driving up energy prices, resulting in the UK price cap rising by 80%. Ofgem on Friday approved a £1,578 increase on the current price cap of £1,971 for the average dual-fuel tariff. The German ambassador to the UK has acknowledged there is a risk public support for Ukraine could wane this winter as the energy crisis intensifies. Putin was “using gas as a weapon” in the UK and all of Europe, Miguel Berger said. “He wants to test our resolve.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/oct/10/iran-says-more-than-120kg-of-uranium-enriched-to-20","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-10T00:55:12Z","webTitle":"Iran says more than 120kg of uranium enriched to 20%","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/10/iran-says-more-than-120kg-of-uranium-enriched-to-20","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/oct/10/iran-says-more-than-120kg-of-uranium-enriched-to-20","fields":{"headline":"Iran says more than 120kg of uranium enriched to 20%","bodyText":"Iran has amassed more than 120kg of 20% enriched uranium, well above the level agreed to in the 2015 deal with world powers, the head of the country’s atomic energy agency has told state television. “We have passed 120 kilograms,” said Mohammad Eslami, head of Iran’s atomic energy organisation. “We have more than that figure. Our people know well that [western powers] were meant to give us the enriched fuel at 20% to use in the Tehran reactor, but they haven’t done so. “If our colleagues do not do it, we would naturally have problems with the lack of fuel for the Tehran reactor.” The Tehran reactor was originally supplied to Iran by the US in the 1960s to produce radioisotopes for use in medical treatments and agriculture, and has since been modified to run on 20% enriched uranium, which the country began producing in 2012. In September the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iran had boosted its stocks of uranium that had been enriched above the percentage allowed in the 2015 deal with world powers. It estimated that Iran had 84.3kg of uranium enriched to 20%, up from 62.8kg when the IAEA last reported in May. Under the deal, Iran was not meant to enrich uranium above 3.67%, well below the 90% threshold needed for use in nuclear weapons. Under the 2015 agreement China, France, Germany, the UK and the US had agreed to lift some sanctions against Iran if Tehran cut back its nuclear programme. But since Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the deal in 2018, Tehran has progressively abandoned its commitments under the agreement, and the US has imposed fresh sanctions in response. On Friday, Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said he was optimistic that talks on reviving the 2015 deal would make progress, provided Washington fully resumed its commitments. Speaking during a visit to Syria, Amir-Abdollahian reiterated that Iran would “soon” return to the nuclear talks with world powers, which include indirect negotiations with the US, Iranian state media reported. The talks, which aim to bring Washington and Tehran back into compliance with the 2015 nuclear pact, were adjourned in June after the hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi was elected Iran’s president. “Of course, we will soon return to the Vienna talks and we are keeping our eyes on the issue of verification and receiving the necessary guarantees for the implementation of commitments by the western parties,” state media quoted Amir-Abdollahian as saying. Amir-Abdollahian did not give details of the verification and monitoring mechanism Tehran was seeking. But Iran has often voiced concern about the need to verify that US sanctions lifted under the accord are not kept in place by Washington.

The artillery attack on the huge plant in the south-east of the country was condemned around the world, and denounced as a war crime by Ukraine and the US embassy in Kyiv. No release of radiation was reported, but Ukrainian officials said workers had not been able to check all the safety infrastructure in the wake of the attack. The reactors have been either closed down or put on reduced power, and it was unclear on Friday night when and whether electricity supply from Zaporizhzhia would be resumed for millions of Ukrainians. Petro Kotin, the acting president of the state-run nuclear power corporation, Energoatom, said workers had been allowed by Russian forces to go back to their posts at the nuclear plant, but had been working “under the barrels of machine guns” and they were “physically and mentally exhausted”. The Ukrainian state inspectorate for nuclear regulation said in a statement on its Facebook page the plant had been “captured by the military forces of the Russian Federation”. “Changes in the radiation state for the current time have not been recorded,” the statement said, adding that power units two and three had been disconnected from the network and nuclear installations were being cooled down. But it warned that any “loss of the possibility to cool down nuclear fuel will lead to significant radioactive releases into the environment” that could “exceed all previous accidents at nuclear power plants, including the Chernobyl accident and the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant”. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said it had been informed that “a projectile overnight had hit a training building in the vicinity of one of the plant’s reactor units, causing a localised fire that was later extinguished”. An emergency of the UN security council was summoned on Friday. The UN undersecretary general, Rosemary DiCarlo, said the attack was unacceptable and irresponsible. She said attacks on nuclear facilities are a direct violation of the Geneva conventions. The UK permanent representative, Barbara Woodward said: “This is the first time that a state has attacked a fuelled and functioning nuclear power plant.” Kotin said Russian forces had broken through a Ukrainian barricade on Thursday night with 100 armoured vehicles, and had begun shelling the plant. He said they targeted administrative buildings and the checkpoint at the entrance until they won control of the site. “As of 9am on 4 March, the station staff were allowed to work, but had been working at the site for almost a day already, so they were physically and mentally exhausted. It is necessary that another shift comes to work,” Kotin said on Energoatom’s Telegram channel. “The management of the station have been under the barrels of machine guns.” He claimed there were “dead and injured”, and the IAEA reported that two people had been wounded. The IAEA confirmed there had been no release of radiation but added: “The operator has reported that the situation remains very challenging and therefore it has not yet been possible to access the whole site to assess that all safety systems are fully functional.” The agency said that, of the plant’s six reactors, one had been shut down for maintenance, two had undergone a controlled shut down, two were being held “in reserve” in lower power mode, and one was operating at 60% power. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, said he had offered to travel to the Chernobyl site to facilitate talks between Ukraine and Russia aimed at agreeing a framework to guarantee the safety of nuclear plants during the conflict, including how to ensure the physical integrity of sites, maintaining power, safety monitoring systems and full staffing, he said. Both sides were considering the proposal. “The situation continues to be extremely tense and challenging,” Grossi said. “The physical integrity of the plant has been compromised with what happened last night. We are fortunate that there was no release of radiation and the integrity of the reactors themselves were not compromised.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed directly to Russian citizens on Friday to stage protests over the seizure of nuclear power infrastructure by Russian troops in Ukraine. “Russian people, I want to appeal to you: how is this possible? After all, we fought together in 1986 against the Chernobyl catastrophe,” he said in a televised address. Russia’s defence ministry blamed the attack on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a monstrous provocation. Zelenskiy said earlier on Friday while the fire was still blazing that Europe “must wake up now. The largest nuclear station in Europe is on fire. Right now, Russian tanks are shelling nuclear units. Those are the tank that have thermal vision, so they know where they are shelling.” “If there will be an explosion, it will be the end to all of us: the end of Europe, the evacuation of Europe,” Zelenskiy added. “Only immediate action of Europe can stop Russian troops and prevent the death of Europe from the disaster at a nuclear station.” He accused Russia of resorting to “nuclear terror”. “No country other than Russia has ever fired on nuclear power units,” he said. “This is the first time in our history, in the history of mankind, the terrorist state now resorted to nuclear terror.” At about 6am on Friday, Ukraine time emergency services said the fire in the training building had been “localised”. The fire was extinguished shortly later, and there were no injuries among the plant staff, the emergency services said. Joe Biden called the Ukrainian president at about 3.40am Kyiv time. According to the White House, Zelenskiy updated the US president on the incident and the two leaders urged Russia “to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site”. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, also spoke to Zelenskiy after news of the fire broke. A Downing Street spokesperson called the situation “gravely concerning”, adding: “The prime minister said the reckless actions of President Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe. He said the UK would do everything it could to ensure the situation did not deteriorate further. “The prime minister said he would be seeking an emergency UN security council meeting in the coming hours, and that the UK would raise this issue immediately with Russia and close partners. Both leaders agreed a ceasefire was crucial.” The confinement chambers of a nuclear reactor are built to withstand heavy impact and even bombing, while the VVER pressurised water reactor itself is designed to shut down in an emergency. VVER reactors are considered much safer than the type of reactor that blew up in Chernobyl in 1986, for example. The Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine – which houses six of the country’s 15 nuclear reactors – as well as the neighbouring town of Energodar, have been surrounded by Russian troops since the beginning of the week. Crowds of local people had stood in the road leading up to the plant, forming a human barrier to the invading force. Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian expert at the project on managing the atom at Harvard University’s Belfer Center, said the most vulnerable part of a nuclear plant was the power and water supply. “If the electricity is taken out, the back-up generators kick in, but if those don’t kick in or their diesel fuel is set on fire, for example, the pumps can’t pump cold water into the reactor and into the spent fuel pools. That’s necessary to keep the nuclear reaction moderated. Otherwise the water will boil out and the core will go critical and explode.” She said confinement chambers were designed to withstand some level of impact and could stop the release of radiation even if the core exploded. She warned, however, that the pools holding spent fuel rods could be more of a worry. “The fuel there is not as active, but they are usually overstuffed,” Budjeryn said. Less active but more tightly packed material was also dangerous if the cooling system were to fail, she said. “And spent fuel pools are not covered by hardened concrete confinement chambers,” Budjeryn added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/08/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-288-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-08T00:41:17Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 288 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/08/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-288-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/08/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-288-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 288 of the invasion","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukrainian energy systems despite global criticism of strikes that have left millions without electricity and water at the start of winter. The Russian leader presented the strikes as a response to a blast on Moscow’s bridge to annexed Crimea and other attacks, accusing Kyiv of blowing up power lines from the Kursk nuclear power plant and not supplying water to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Russia is still set on seizing parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that Putin claimed as his own, the Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. He added that the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Russia annexed in 2014, was vulnerable to attacks by Ukrainian forces, after officials there said they had shot down a drone near a key naval base. Russia has claimed that its proposed safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is to “stop Ukrainian shelling”. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, also said the US’s withdrawal from a treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles was a “destructive” act that created a vacuum and stoked additional security risks. About 10,000 Ukrainian service personnel and roughly the same number of Ukrainian civilians are believed to be being held in Russian detention facilities, according to a Ukrainian official. Oleksandr Kononenko, who oversees human rights in the security and defence sector on behalf of Ukraine’s parliament, said the civilians were being detained illegally as prisoners of war because of their alleged association with the Ukrainian army or state. Explosions have been reported at Berdiansk airbase in the Zaporizhzhia region. Three large explosions were heard, as well as smaller ones, near the city on the coast of the Sea of Azov. Russian forces have fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid, which is still working despite taking major damage, a senior official said. Volodymyr Kudrytsky, the chief executive of the grid operator Ukrenergo, also told a meeting arranged by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that his officials were scouring the world for the complex equipment needed for repairs. Ukraine has introduced new emergency power cuts as it tried to repair energy infrastructure damaged in Russian airstrikes, which the national grid operator said had caused significant supply shortages. The grid operator Ukrenergo said the situation was complicated by the weather, with western regions facing frost, rain, snow and strong winds that were causing wires to ice over, but the most difficult situation was in eastern areas, where fighting has been fiercest. Russian troops are reportedly taking part in tactical exercises in Belarus, according to the Russian defence ministry. Video clips posted by the ministry showed Russian soldiers in snow gear training near tanks in a winter landscape, firing weapons including artillery. Russia freed the jailed US basketball star Brittney Griner on Thursday in a high-level prisoner exchange for the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, who had been held in a US prison for 12 years. Joe Biden, who had made Griner’s release a top priority after she spent almost 10 months in jail on drugs charges, said in an address from the White House that he had spoken with Griner and found her “in good spirits”. Biden expressed regret the deal did not include Paul Whelan, an American jailed since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the US government say are baseless. An anonymous US official told CNN that leaving Whelan out of the deal had been “a difficult decision” but “it was a choice to get Brittney or nothing”. The EU plans to tighten up sanctions on Russia’s military and industrial complex, pro-Kremlin media and Russian nationalist groups fighting in Ukraine, according to leaked papers. A total of eight individuals are facing personal sanctions, including Russian officials said to be involved in the illegal transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children in Russia, as well as the leaders of rightwing nationalist groups. Russian shelling killed 10 people and wounded many others in the town of Kurakhove in eastern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko warned of an “apocalypse” scenario for the city this winter if Russian airstrikes on infrastructure continue. Russia has fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid, Interfax Ukraine news agency said. President Vladimir Putin has said that Russia’s war in Ukraine could turn into a “long-term process”. Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack. Putin also claimed that Russia would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict and denied that Russian troops were deserting en-mass from the field of battle. He claimed that the Russian military would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia. The risk of nuclear weapons being used in the Ukraine conflict has lessened thanks to international pressure on Russia, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an interview published Thursday. “One thing has changed for the time being: Russia has stopped threatening to use nuclear weapons. In response to the international community marking a red line,” Scholz said in the interview with Germany’s Funke media group. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Russia is attempting to “freeze” the fighting in Ukraine over the winter to prepare its forces for a renewed assault early next year. Stoltenberg urged Nato allies to continue sending weapons to Kyiv over the winter, adding that the conditions for a peaceful settlement to the war are “not there now”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said 31 “suspicious packages” had been sent to Ukrainian missions in 15 countries. In the past week, Ukraine says its embassies and consultants across Europe have received “bloody” packages, some containing animal eyes, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. A road accident in the temporarily occupied eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk has left 16 people dead and several injured, according to a Russian-backed official and state media. The accident involved a minibus and a truck, whose passengers included soldiers, and took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, emergency services told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has called on the country’s western allies to boycott Russian culture. Writing in the Guardian, Tkachenko argues that a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”. The US has made clear to Ukraine its “concerns” about any escalation of the war with Russia, the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said. Kirby said the principle behind the war in Ukraine was one of sovereignty, and “unlike the Russians, we respect Ukrainian sovereignty”. Kirby’s comments came after Kyiv appeared to launch a pre-emptive strike on bombers on two Russian airbases far from the frontlines earlier this week. The Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was “provocation towards our country”. The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over President Joe Biden’s request earlier this year. Britain has ordered “several thousand” NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played “a decisive role” in pushing back the Russian invasion, but Labour has complained that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make. BP should donate its “wartime profits” in Russia to the reconstruction of Ukraine or ministers should impose a special windfall tax on the oil company to force it to do so, British MPs have told parliament. The British oil supermajor has a 19.75% stake in Rosneft, one of the Kremlin’s most important oil assets and signalled its intent to exit Russia nine months ago, after Russia invaded Ukraine. At least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office. Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report by the Office of the high commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said. An Orthodox priest accused of leaking information on Ukrainian defence positions to Russia has been sentenced to 12 years in prison, according to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office. The priest from Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, had been informing the Russians about the positions of Ukrainian troops since April, it said in a statement on Telegram."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/sep/20/the-radio-was-the-soundtrack-to-my-life-but-i-turned-it-off-a-week-ago-and-may-never-turn-it-back-on","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-20T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"The radio was the soundtrack to my life.

OK, caveats: I’ll turn it right down if people are trying to talk to me, or if I don’t want to answer a young person’s questions about North Korean missile testing first thing in the morning. I’ll make a mad leap if the Archers comes on, to a different station, but I won’t turn it off. Radio 4 has been a lifelong susurration, sometimes so ambient I don’t even get annoyed by it, sometimes so annoying it’s like the permanent low-level siren in a nuclear power plant. And still I don’t turn it off. Then, maybe eight days ago, I unplugged the radio and have lived in this cave of silence since. There was no final straw or particular anti-royal sentiment. I have nothing against fervent monarchism, sincerely expressed: it was merely the sound of people aping royalism, the performative respect, above all the repetitiveness. It’s such a fundamental principle of broadcasting, that whatever you say, you can’t say it twice. Even the rookiest DJ on hospital radio knows this, which is how they find themselves accidentally disclosing details of their personal life, just to avoid repeating the sandwich offers. Six days ago, I gave it one more chance, only to find Today programme presenters trying to amp up the nation’s solemnity by talking more slowly. Honestly, the insult: we have to hear the same thing an apparently infinite number of times, but now it’s going to take much longer. Here are the downsides: without Thought for the Day, there’s no longer a cue to have a shower, so my personal hygiene has taken a hit; I have no clue what has happened in the sports; I don’t even know if sports are still occurring; I don’t know what the weather is like elsewhere in the country. I’ve been going to Twitter for the news, so US politics has undue prominence but at least the climate crisis is at the centre of everything.

That is the key result of an Opinium poll carried out for the Observer in the wake of publication of the government’s controversial energy security plans last week. Ministers backed nuclear power but shunned new onshore wind plants as the main means for protecting the UK against future energy crises. But the new poll indicates Tory voters’ backing for wind turbines almost matches that of Labour and Lib Dem supporters – suggesting the move against onshore wind, a result of backbench Conservative pressure, runs counter to the views of the party’s own voters. In the Opinium poll, 79% of Tory voters said they were strongly or somewhat in favour of windfarms being installed in the UK, compared with 83% of Labour voters and 88% of Lib Dems. Two-thirds of all voters said they would be happy for a windfarm to be built near them. By contrast, only 46% of all voters favoured new nuclear power stations in principle, while a mere 32% favoured gas power plants. Less than a third of voters would be happy with a nuclear power station being built near them, while less than a quarter would approve of having a gas power station in their neighbourhood. These findings suggest that government thinking is at some distance from the public’s perception of the need to ensure energy security while still working to achieve net zero emissions. It is also at odds with warnings from experts who say reliance on atomic power raises key concerns for the nation. They point out that the country’s next nuclear plant, Hinkley Point C, currently under construction in Somerset, was supposed to start generating electricity in 2017 but will not do so until 2026 because of delays that have raised the station’s cost from £16bn to £23bn. “Instead of this wasteful nuclear plan, the government should invest in onshore wind to help lower people’s bills now,” said the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey. “Safely storing nuclear waste is also expensive, complicated and controversial.” However, former Tory energy minister Charles Hendry – who now advises the energy industry – said he was pleased the government had committed to more nuclear but doubted whether the funding model for building new plants would attract enough private sector interest. The government needed to address whether it should take on the entire funding of the building of the plants, he said. “That happens in almost every other country in the world. Then if it chooses to, when they are built, it can sell them off to the private sector. That is the most assured way of getting the investment which is necessary and the partnerships which are necessary.” But scientists are warning that heavy reliance on atomic energy is premature when the critical issue of nuclear waste disposal has yet to be tackled. The UK has still not selected a site to build an underground store for the spent fuel rods and radioactive cladding it has accumulated over the past seven decades of operating nuclear plants. Most of the nation’s nuclear waste is still stored above ground, at Sellafield in Cumbria. “We need to build an underground store that is acceptable to local people, that is geologically stable, and which is big enough to store the 750,000 cubic metres of nuclear waste that we will have accumulated once all our current reactors are in operation,” said Prof Claire Corkhill of Sheffield University. “That will take another decade at best. Only then would I be happy to know another eight nuclear power plants were going to be built in the UK.” In 2019, the UK relaunched its efforts to get agreement to build an underground nuclear waste facility. So far residents in four areas – three in Cumbria and one in Lincolnshire – have entered the voluntary process to explore whether it would be possible to have the store built in their neighbourhood. Drilling to test how subterranean water flow might damage a facility in each area will be carried out in the near future. Then, if the rocks there are found to be suitable, geologists will have to estimate if a sufficiently large underground store could be built in that location. “We could find an area has good rocks but … not sufficient space to store all the waste we need to bury,” added Corkhill. “Then we might have to try to find a second, or entirely new site. This is not an issue we can rush.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/21/how-reliant-is-germany-and-europe-russian-gas-nord-stream","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-21T08:21:58Z","webTitle":"How reliant is Germany – and the rest of  Europe – on Russian gas?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/21/how-reliant-is-germany-and-europe-russian-gas-nord-stream","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/21/how-reliant-is-germany-and-europe-russian-gas-nord-stream","fields":{"headline":"How reliant is Germany – and the rest of  Europe – on Russian gas?","bodyText":"Russia has resumed critical gas supplies to Europe through Germany, reopening the Nord Stream gas pipeline after 10 days, albeit at a lower capacity. But will this be enough to resolve the pressing energy worries of Germany and the wider continent? How reliant is Germany on Russian gas? Natural gas makes up about 27% of Germany’s overall energy mix. Before the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine, just over half (55%) of gas consumed in Germany was imported from Russia. Since Russia invaded Ukraine at the end of February, the German government has scrambled to source gas from elsewhere, for example by buying more natural gas from Norway or the Netherlands, or by expanding its infrastructure for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US and Qatar. As of the end of June, Germany is only reliant on Russian imports for about a quarter of its gas needs. This last quarter, however, is required in areas where Germany is particularly vulnerable: to heat private homes and to power the industry of the EU’s largest economy. In both of those areas, gas is the single largest source of energy, at about 37% of the overall mix. Why is German reliance on Russian gas causing so much anguish? Currently, very little gas is flowing from Russia to Germany through any of the three pipelines that connect the two countries. The Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom in May ceased deliveries through the Yamal pipeline passing through Belarus and Poland, while the Ukraine-transiting Transgas, an extension of the Soyuz pipeline from Russia, is prioritising deliveries to Slovakia and Austria. Germany’s most important pipeline, Nord Stream 1, used to carry up to 170m cubic metres of gas a day. But in mid-June Gazprom reduced its deliveries to about 40m cubic metres a day, citing the delayed “repair” of a turbine by the German company Siemens. On 11 July, Nord Stream closed down for 10 days for scheduled maintenance works, but the assumption in Germany was that Putin would use the break as a pretext to stop gas exports altogether, with reference to further pretend technical issues. A government spokesperson said on Wednesday that the turbine under discussion was a replacement part not due to be put to use until September anyway, and thus could not explain the drastic throttling of deliveries. On Thursday morning, the company behind Nord Stream 1 announced that gas was flowing through its pipeline once more, although the head of Germany’s federal network agency said Gazprom had said gas would resume only at 30% of its original capacity. Will Germany run out of gas this winter? If Gazprom resumes gas deliveries at 40% of the capacity before the maintenance break, Germany will narrowly scrape through the winter without shortages, modelling by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy suggests. Since Germany has rushed to fill its gas reserves in the first half of the year – ironically buying more gas from Russia than usual in spite of economic sanctions – it is expected to avoid being forced into rationing. It would, however, enter the winter of 2023-24 in a considerably worse situation than this year. In a worst-case scenario where Germany can’t get more gas and also fails to make savings, the institute predicts damage to the economy of up to €283bn (£241.5bn). Either way, there will be pressure on Germany to reduce its gas consumption significantly in the coming months. According to calculations by the Brussels-based economic policy thinktank Bruegel, Germany would have to find reductions of almost 30%, or 20% if it manages to complete two floating LNG terminals in the North Sea ports of Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbüttel by the start of next year, as planned. If there are shortages, how will rationing work? Under current plans, private households would be protected from gas rationing along with other “protected” customers such as care homes or hospitals. The brunt of reductions would have to be made by German industry, accountable for about a third of the country’s gas use. Yet in recent weeks voices from the chemical and pharmaceutical industries have argued that rationing their sector could set off domino effects with catastrophic consequences for the entire economy, and the energy minister, Robert Habeck, has said private households would also need to “play their part”. Monitoring radiator use or rationing the individual gas supply to millions of private homes would be technically impossible, however, and a more likely outcome is that the government would try to force consumers into making savings through higher bills. How did Germany end up in this dilemma? Both Olaf Scholz’s government and that of his predecessor Angela Merkel identified natural gas as an essential “bridge technology” on the path to a renewable energy future. The war in Ukraine, however, is threatening to tear down that bridge. Germany is due to shut down its last three remaining nuclear power plants by the end of the year, a decision announced by Merkel after an earthquake triggered an accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011, but one whose groundwork had been laid by the previous Social Democrat-Green coalition government in 2000. To meet carbon-reduction targets it is also planning to exit coal power by 2038 at the latest, and, if possible by 2035. The buildup of renewable energy sources, which accelerated massively at the start of the 2010s, has slowed down in recent years. With the exit dates set, and Germany having incrementally liberalised its energy market since the late 1990s, the economy grew increasingly reliant on Russian gas, which was not only cheap but also satisfied a political desire in some German political circles for knitting closer diplomatic ties with Moscow. Couldn’t Germany just reactivate its nuclear power plants? The three remaining power stations – two in the south and one in the north – make up only 5% of Germany’s electricity mix. The government says expanding their lifespan would offer little reward and come attached with considerable risk. The plants, said Habeck recently, were set up now so their fuel rods would be burnt up by the end of the year. To extend them, they would need to go into a saver mode that would also produce less energy. Extending them for a few years rather than months would require purchasing new fuel rods and safety inspections that are already two years overdue. Not carrying out such inspections, Habeck warned, would turn Germany’s nuclear plants into prime targets for potential cyber-attacks. Nuclear industry spokespeople, however, say the safety inspections could be carried out without having to wind down the plants in the meantime. Pro-nuclear voices also point out that Germany’s electricity needs will grow over the coming years as the country switches to renewable sources of energy: the thinktank Agora Energiewende expects Germany to double its electricity requirements to 1,000 terawatt hours by 2045. Habeck, a Green party politician, said he would assess the situation around nuclear energy “without taboos”, but a U-turn on the issue harbours potential for an enormous loss of face for the environmental party, which grew out of the anti-nuclear movement of the 1980s. What about the rest of Europe? Russia accounted for about two-fifths of the EU’s gas needs before the start of the war in Ukraine. The EU committed in March to reducing gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year, but has failed to establish a consensus on an outright import ban amid fears of economic knock-on effects in several states."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/feb/10/france-to-build-up-to-14-new-nuclear-reactors-by-2050-says-macron","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-10T18:12:58Z","webTitle":"France to build up to 14 new nuclear reactors by 2050, says Macron","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/france-to-build-up-to-14-new-nuclear-reactors-by-2050-says-macron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/feb/10/france-to-build-up-to-14-new-nuclear-reactors-by-2050-says-macron","fields":{"headline":"France to build up to 14 new nuclear reactors by 2050, says Macron","bodyText":"Emmanuel Macron has announced a “renaissance” for the French nuclear industry with a vast programme to build as many as 14 new reactors, arguing that it would help end the country’s reliance on fossil fuels and make France carbon neutral by 2050. “What our country needs ... is the rebirth of France’s nuclear industry,” Macron said in a speech in the eastern industrial town of Belfort, in which he lauded the country’s technological prowess. The centrist French president, who is expected to announce his campaign for re-election this month, is conscious of a growing debate about energy ahead of this spring’s presidential vote as costs to consumers rise. Environmental issues are also a growing concern among French voters. Atomic energy provides about 70% of French electricity, and low-cost nuclear power has been a mainstay of the French economy since the 1970s, but recent attempts to build new-generation reactors to replace older models have become mired in cost overruns and delays. Presidential candidates on the right have supported more nuclear power plants saying France should have “sovereignty” over its electricity, while detractors on the left have warned of the cost and complexity of building new reactors. Environmentalists have raised safety concerns over radioactive waste that remains deadly for tens of thousands of years. Macron said French nuclear regulators were “unequalled” in their rigour and professionalism and that the decision to build new nuclear power plants was a “choice of progress, a choice of confidence in science and technology”. He also announced a major acceleration in the development of solar and offshore wind power. He said France had no choice but to rely on renewables and nuclearand that the country would also have to consume significantly less energy in the next decades. He said he would seek to extend the lives of all existing French nuclear plants where it was safe to do so. The announcement comes at a difficult time for debt-laden, state-controlled energy provider, EDF, which faces delays and budget overuns on new nuclear plants in France and Britain, and corrosion problems in some of its ageing reactors. Macron announced the construction of at least six new reactors by EDF by 2050, with an option for another eight. His recent focus on nuclear power marks a policy shift from the start of his presidency, when he had promised to reduce its share in France’s energy mix. The French government lobbied hard and successfully to get the European Commission to label nuclear power “green” this month in a landmark review which means it can attract funding as a climate-friendly power source. The Green presidential candidate, Yannick Jadot, said it was a moral imperative to progressively end France’s dependence on nuclear to protect the climate and French people’s safety. He said Macron’s project was backward-looking and would condemn France to a kind of “energy and industrial obsolescence”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/16/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-imposes-conditions-on-nuclear-plant-visit-zelenskiy-shakes-up-security-chiefs-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T18:00:21Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: explosions reported in Crimea; Kyiv publishes identities of soldiers accused of war crimes – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/16/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-imposes-conditions-on-nuclear-plant-visit-zelenskiy-shakes-up-security-chiefs-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/16/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-imposes-conditions-on-nuclear-plant-visit-zelenskiy-shakes-up-security-chiefs-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: explosions reported in Crimea; Kyiv publishes identities of soldiers accused of war crimes – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm right now in Ukraine. In an exclusive with the Guardian, Mykhailo Podolyak, a key adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said there could be more attacks in the “next two or three months” similar to today’s mysterious strikes on a railway junction and airbase in Crimea. Though Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attacks – and Russia said a fire on Tuesday had set off explosions at the ammunitions depot in the Dzhankoi district – Podolyak called the Dzhankoi incident a “reminder” that “Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouse explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves”. A record number of cars have crossed the Crimea bridge that links Crimea to Russia – which suggests that a number of Russian tourists and Russians who settled into the region after the annexation in 2014 are now fleeing.

The first ship to depart Ukraine under a deal to resume grain exports from the country two weeks ago was docked in Syria’s Tartous on Tuesday, according to a shipping source and satellite data. Reuters writes that the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni set sail from Ukraine’s Odesa port on 1 August under a hard-won grain deal but did not unload in Lebanon as planned. Its location had not been clear in recent days as it has kept its transponder off. This video shows the ship leaving from Odesa after weeks of negotiations led by the UN and Turkey: There have been a number of attacks across Russian-occupied Crimea: The first took place at an ammunitions depot near Dzhankoi in the north, damaging a railway station and wounding two. Next, there were reports of an explosion about 58 miles (93 kilometres) south in Simoferopol. Now, reports of explosions and black smoke at a military airbase in Gvardeyskoye, near the middle of the region. Ukraine is playing it coy at the moment on whether its armed forces are behind these attacks, but Russia’s defence ministry has fully come out and called them “acts of sabotage”. With the explosions in Russian-occupied Crimea, Russian forces struck back, with missile attacks reported in the northern Zhytomyr region. For a short while today, all of Ukraine was under an air raid siren alert. The Russian federal security service is coming out and saying that “Ukrainian saboteurs” blew up six towers of high-voltage power lines coming from the Kursk nuclear power plant, disrupting its operations. This comes as both Moscow and Kyiv lob accusations at each other of heightening the risk of a nuclear accident. Estonia today removed a Soviet-era second world war memorial from Narva after accusing Russia of using such monuments to stir up tensions. Russian courts were busy today: one court fined rock legend Yuri Shevchuk after finding him guilty of “discrediting” the Russian army when he condemned the military invasion of Ukraine. Another court fined US-based streaming service Twitch for hosting a short video containing what the court called “fake” information about alleged war crimes in the Ukrainian town of Bucha. Though the content of the video was not specified, Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites such as Google, Twitter and Wikipedia, accusing them of hosting “fake” content related to its military campaign in Ukraine. And there were various verified accounts out of Bucha of Russian soldiers torturing, executing and sexually assaulting civilians. After Russian forces left the area, Ukrainian armed forces found mass graves of civilians with their armed tied behind their backs, some showing signs that they had been beaten before they had been killed. Ukraine’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova has identified at least 10 soldiers involved in human rights abuses in Bucha. The Ukrainian security service has identified eight additional Russian soldiers suspected of war crimes in Bucha. These eight servicemen, most of them of unit 6720 of the federal service of the national guard of the Russian federation, are accused of looting property and ransacking abandoned homes. The Ukrainian security service has identified eight additional Russian soldiers suspected of war crimes in Bucha.

Another attack in Russian-occupied territory: it appears unidentified individuals have blown up a railway in the Kursk oblast. The railway was only used for freight trains. Estonia today removed a Soviet-era second world war memorial from Narva after accusing Russia of using such monuments to stir up tensions. The Guardian’s Jon Henley reports that it was the most significant removal yet out of an estimated 200 to 400 such monuments that the government has pledged to take down by the end of the year. “No one wants to see our militant and hostile neighbour foment tensions in our home,” Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said. The Baltic state was a Soviet republic from 1944 until 1991 and nearly a quarter of its population of 1.3 million people are ethnic Russians. “We will not afford Russia the opportunity to use the past to disturb the peace in Estonia,” Kallas said. A second world war-era T-34 tank that formed part of the memorial will go to the Estonian War Museum and a mass grave of wartime victims will instead receive a neutral grave marker. Local opposition to removing the monument had sparked fears of a repeat of history – in 2007, riots broke out in Tallinn over the removal of a Soviet monument. Only 4% of Narva’s residents are ethnic Estonians and more than 80% are ethnic Russians. Narva’s mayor Katri Raik had previously refused to hand the tank over to the museum. Annual Victory Day commemoration ceremonies take place around the memorial, and the Narva city council had failed to reach a decision about the removal of the monument despite a government order to do so before the end of the year.

Earlier, RIA reported that Telegram messenger was hit with two fines totalling 11m rubles ($179,000) for refusing to delete channels that allegedly showed how to “sabotage” military vehicles and hosting “unreliable data” about Russia’s progress. The Russian federal security service is purportedly saying that “Ukrainian saboteurs” blew up six towers of high-voltage power lines coming from the Kursk nuclear power plant, disrupting its operations, Russian media is reporting. They are treating these attacks that took place in the Kurchatov district earlier this month – on 4, 9 and 12 August – as an act of terror. With explosions in Russian-occupied Crimea – which Ukraine is hinting that its armed forces are responsible for, but not yet accepting responsibility for them – Russian forces have struck back, with missile attacks reported in the northern Zhytomyr region. The Ukrainian air force has tweeted a video of the explosion at the ammunition depot near Dzhankoi in Russian-occupied Crimea, in yet another coy hint that Ukraine was behind the attack but not quite taking responsibility. A Russian court today fined rock legend Yuri Shevchuk after finding him guilty of “discrediting” the Russian army when he condemned the military invasion of Ukraine, Agence France-Presse is reporting. The frontman of the 1980s Soviet rock band DDT was ordered to pay the maximum fine of 50,000 rubles ($815), the press service of a court in the central city of Ufa said on the Telegram messenger. According to the statement, Shevchuk made a speech during his concert that contained “public calls to prevent the use of Russia’s armed forces”. Shevchuk did not attend the hearing in person because he was in quarantine for Covid-19, but released a written statement through his lawyer. “I, Yuri Shevchuk have always been against war, in any country, at any time ... I think all problems and difficulties of a political nature between countries and people should be resolved through diplomacy,” the statement said. Shevchuk has over the years publicly criticised Vladimir Putin and opposed the annexation of Crimea in 2014. On 18 May, the 65-year-old performer told his audience in Ufa that it “is not the president’s ass that needs to be licked and kissed”, according to videos posted online. “Now people are being killed in Ukraine. Why? Our guys are dying in Ukraine. Why?” he told a cheering crowd. The attacks on Russian-occupied Crimea appear to be escalating. The first took place at an ammunitions depot near Dzhankoi in the north, damaging a railway station and wounding two. Next, there were reports of an explosion about 58 miles (93km) south in Simferopol. Now, there are reports of explosions and black smoke at a military airbase in Gvardeyskoye, near the middle of the region: Ukraine is being very coy at the moment on whether its armed forces are behind these attacks. Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff for Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is hinting that they are: “Operation ‘demilitarisation’ in the jewellery style of the armed forces will continue until the complete de-occupation of Ukrainian territories.” BBC’s Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse noted that by “jewellery”, Yermak meant “precise” in this instance. There are now reports of explosions in Simferopol toward the south of the Crimea, about 58 miles (93km) away from the explosion at the ammunition depot that damaged a railway line in the north near Dzhankoi. It’s coming up to 1.30pm in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Explosions have rocked an ammunition depot in Crimea, severely disrupting railway services , reports Reuters. Moscow’s senior representative in the region, Sergei Aksyonov, confirmed that two people were wounded, railway traffic halted and about 2,000 people evacuated from a village near the military depot – but he skirted talk of a cause. Ukraine hinted at involvement but has not explicitly said it was them. It comes after another reported explosion at a substation, also in Crimea. Vladimir Putin said that western countries were seeking to extend a “Nato-like system” into the Asia-Pacific region, Reuters reported. Delivering the welcome address at the Moscow international security conference, Putin said the US was trying to “drag out” the conflict in Ukraine. He added that US House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan earlier this month had been “a thoroughly planned provocation”. Russia’s Black Sea fleet is struggling to exercise effective sea control, with patrols generally limited to the waters within sight of the Crimean coast, according to the latest British intelligence report. The Black Sea fleet continues to use long-range cruise missiles to support ground offensives but is keeping a defensive posture, the British Ministry of Defence said in its daily intelligence bulletin. Ukraine has received six more M109 howitzers from Latvia, its minister of defence, Oleksii Reznikov, announced. Ukrainian and Russian officials reported shelling near the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, on Monday with both sides blaming each other. One Russian-installed regional official said 25 heavy artillery strikes from US-made M777 howitzers had hit near the plant and residential areas. Ukraine said it was Russian forces that had shelled the city to try to make it appear that Ukraine was attacking it. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for action at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia plant, urging the world not to “lose to terrorism” or “give in to nuclear blackmail … If now the world does not show strength and decisiveness to defend one nuclear power station, it will mean that the world has lost,” he said in his nightly address. “If Russia’s actions cause a catastrophe, the consequences may also hit those who remain silent so far.” Russia’s defence minister and the UN chief discussed the security situation at the plant by phone on Monday, the Russian defence ministry announced. Russia earlier said it would facilitate an IAEA mission to the plant amid warnings from the UN’s nuclear agency of a nuclear disaster unless fighting stops. However, a senior Russian diplomat said that any such IAEA mission could not pass through the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and through the frontline as it was too dangerous, according to Russian news agencies. The UN says it has the logistics and security capacity to support a visit by experts. Five Europeans face trial on mercenary charges in separatist-controlled Donetsk, Ukraine. Mathias Gustafsson of Sweden, Vjekoslav Prebeg of Croatia, and Britons John Harding, Andrew Hill and Dylan Healy all pleaded not guilty to charges of being mercenaries and “undergoing training to seize power by force”, according to Russian media reports. They could face the death penalty under the laws of the self-proclaimed, unrecognised Donetsk People’s Republic. Three civilians were killed and two wounded by an explosive device while swimming in the Black Sea in the Ukrainian southern region of Odesa, local police said. People working on a construction site reportedly ignored barriers and warning signs on a beach in the Belhorod-Dnistrovskyi district and went swimming in the sea. Three men aged 25, 32 and 53 were killed and another man and a woman were wounded, police said. The British military is training 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers in marksmanship, battlefield first aid and urban warfare. British trainers aim is to turn raw recruits into battle-ready soldiers in a matter of weeks. The first batch arrived last month and have already been sent back to replenish depleted Ukrainian units. Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Nordic nations have also sent trainers. The Moscow-appointed administration in Ukraine’s Kherson region plans to hold a referendum on 11 September, according to Kremlin sources. Referendums are also planned in three other Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia – where Moscow aims to annex the territories and declare them to be a new region of Russia. Ukraine’s parliament has extended martial law for a further three months. Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff for Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is hinting that Ukraine was behind the explosions in Crimea: Footage shared widely on social media purports to show the explosion at an ammunition depot that took place near the village of Mayskoye in Russian-occupied Crimea. Russia’s defence ministry claimed the explosions were caused by a fire at a temporary storage facility near an arms depot, state-owned news agency RIA reported. The blasts caused two injuries, said Crimea’s Russia-appointed governor, Sergei Aksyonov. These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. The next few weeks may determine Ukraine’s de facto borders for years to come. In the eastern Donbas, Russian troops continue to advance. In the south, by contrast, their grip appears shakier. The Guardian’s Luke Harding visits the city of Mykolaiv, where he meets determined Ukrainians. The reported explosion at an ammunition depot in the village of Maiskoye near Dzhankoi in the north of Crimea, has damaged a railway line. Sergei Aksenov, the head of the peninsula that was annexed by Russia in 2014, said that trains from the Krasnodar territory will only go to the village of Vladislavovka near the town of Feodosia, reports the BBC. Passengers can then get on a bus and be taken to the nearest bus station, he confirmed. Vladimir Putin said today that western countries were seeking to extend a “Nato-like system” into the Asia-Pacific region, Reuters reported. Delivering the welcome address at the Moscow international security conference, Putin said the US was trying to “drag out” the conflict in Ukraine. He added that US House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan earlier this month had been “a thoroughly planned provocation”. Reuters has obtained an image of the reported substation fire in Dzhankoi in Crimea. We reported earlier that Ukrainian broadcaster NEXTA-TV published unconfirmed footage of the blast. Russian media outlet RIA Novosti also reported that a transformer substation caught fire in the city at about 6am on Tuesday. So far, Russian authorities have not provided any further details on the incident. It comes after a separate explosion at an ammunition depot in the village of Mayskoye, Russia’s Tass news agency reported. Russia’s defence ministry said no “serious” casualties had occurred in the explosion, state-owned news agency RIA reported. The Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said today that Russia had no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. During a speech at the Moscow international security conference, he alleged that Ukrainian military operations are being planned by the US and Britain, and that Nato had increased its troop deployment in eastern and central Europe “several times over”, Reuters reports. Shoigu added that the AUKUS bloc of Australia, the UK and US had the potential to develop into “a political-military alliance”. Luke Harding reports for us from Mykolaiv: In a wrecked office inside Mykolaiv’s administration building in southern Ukraine, Dmytro Pletenchuk showed off his collection of Russian weapons. Propped against the wall were fired Russian rockets and cluster bombs. “I’m thinking about opening a bar for veterans when the war is over,” he said. “My friend who was killed in Kharkiv used to run one. We could use them as decorations.” Pletenchuk’s one-time government workplace was a spectacular ruin. In March, a Russian missile slammed into the regional state HQ, gouging a giant hole, killing 37 people and wounding many more. The security guards in reception miraculously survived. Colleagues having breakfast in the canteen were less fortunate. There are bloodstains on the stairs and in an upstairs corridor. “We are fighting against fucking idiots. It’s good for us. But they have nuclear weapons,” Pletenchuk said, showing off his glass-strewn ninth-floor office, with a panoramic view over the city’s river and port. “Russia is like a monkey with a hand grenade,” he added. “It’s a problem for the whole world. We don’t know if they are going to blow everyone up.” Read more of Luke Harding’s article here: ‘A question of time’: Ukrainians determined to win back the south Ukraine has not officially confirmed or denied responsibility for the reported explosions in Crimea. But, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted after the explosions today that there is a “high risk of death for invaders and thieves” in the Russian-occupied area. Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014, despite most of the world recognising it as Ukrainian territory. Earlier we reported that an ammunition depot had caught fire in the town of Mayskoye in Crimea. Russia‘s defence ministry said there were no serious casualties from the explosion, state-owned news agency RIA reported. Interfax quoted the defence ministry as saying that a fire had broken out in the temporary storage area of the ammunition depot. Here is a quick snap from Ukrainian senior presidential adviser Anton Gerashchenko purporting to show the explosions reported to have occurred at an ammunition depot in Crimea this morning. Russia’s Black Sea fleet is struggling to exercise effective sea control, with patrols generally limited to the waters within sight of the Crimean coast, according to the latest British intelligence report. The Black Sea fleet continues to use long-range cruise missiles to support ground offensives but is keeping a defensive posture, the British Ministry of Defence said in its daily intelligence bulletin. The Black Sea fleet’s limited effectiveness undermines Russia’s overall invasion strategy, in part because the amphibious threat to Odesa has been largely neutralised, the intelligence update added. We have a little more detail on the blasts reported in Crimea earlier this morning. According to more local media reports, an ammunition depot in the village of Maiskoye near Dzhankoi in the north of Crimea, has also caught fire. Russian state media outlet Tass cited the Russian-appointed administrative head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov. “The detonation of ammunition occurred in the north of Crimea,” the outlet reported in a Telegram update. Residents are being evacuated, Tass added in a Telegram update. Aksyonov earlier said that he urgently left for the village, located about 25km south-east of Dzhankoi to investigate an explosion at a transformer substation. The cause so far remains unknown. Multiple unconfirmed reports and video footage of explosions are filtering in this morning from occupied territories in Ukraine’s south and south-east. Ukrainian broadcaster NEXTA-TV published unconfirmed footage of a blast purportedly from Dzhankoi in Crimea. Russian media outlet RIA Novosti also reported that a transformer substation caught fire in the city around 6am on Tuesday. The Russian-appointed administrative head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said that he urgently left for the village of Mayskoye near Dzhankoi. “I left for the village of Mayskoye, Dzhankoy district. The circumstances of the incident are being investigated. I will inform you as information becomes available,” Aksenov said in his Telegram channel, as reported by RIA. Zelenskiy dismissed or reshuffled the security service heads of four regional departments. According to the decrees published on the president’s website, Serhiy Zayats was dismissed from the post of head of the SBU main directorate in the Kyiv region. Yuriy Boreichuk was dismissed from the post of head of the SBU main directorate in the Ternopil region. Artem Bondarenko was moved from the post of head of the SBU main directorate in the Lviv region, to head of the SBU main directorate in Kyiv and its region. Ukraine has received six more M109 howitzers from Latvia, its minister of defence, Oleksii Reznikov, announced. On the topic of grain shipments from Ukraine’s ports, a total of five ships, two from from the port of Yuzhny and three from Chernomorsk, departed from Ukrainian ports loaded with corn and wheat. In addition, four ships en route to Ukrainian ports will be inspected by the Joint Coordination Centre today, Turkey’s ministry of defence added in an announcement early this morning. The first cargo of humanitarian food aid bound for Africa from Ukraine since Russia’s invasion has reportedly left the Ukrainian port of Pivdennyi. The ship Brave Commander was seen leaving the port, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, confirmed the news saying the cargo ship is expected to arrive in Ethiopia in two weeks. Earlier, a joint co-ordination centre, set up by Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Nations, said it had approved the ship’s departure. The United Nations has the logistics and security capacity to support a visit by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a spokesman said, but a Russian diplomat imposed conditions, saying routing any mission through Ukraine’s capital was too dangerous. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said that “in close contact with the IAEA, the UN secretariat has assessed that it has in Ukraine the logistics and security capacity to be able to support any IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from Kyiv”. But he said both Russia and Ukraine have to agree. However, a senior Russian diplomat said that any such IAEA mission could not pass through the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and through the frontline as it was too dangerous. Russian state media RIA news agency quoted Igor Vishnevetsky, deputy head of the foreign ministry’s nuclear proliferation and arms control department, as telling journalists: Imagine what it means to pass through Kyiv – it means they get to the nuclear plant through the front line. This is a huge risk, given that Ukraine’s armed forces are not all made up in the same way.” Russia’s Tass news agency also quoted Vishnevetsky as saying that any such mission had no mandate to address the “demilitarisation” of the plant as demanded by Kyiv as it could only deal with “fulfilment of IAEA guarantees”. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, earlier called for an end to military activity around the plant. Russia’s defence minister and the UN chief discussed the security situation at the plant by phone on Monday, the Russian defence ministry announced. Russia earlier said it would facilitate an IAEA mission to the plant amid warnings from the UN’s nuclear agency of a nuclear disaster unless fighting stops. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for action at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia plant, urging the world not to “lose to terrorism” or “give in to nuclear blackmail”. In his nightly address he said: All Russian troops must be immediately withdrawn from the plant and neighbouring areas without any conditions. … if now the world lacks the strength and determination to protect one nuclear plant, it means that the world loses. Loses to terrorists. Gives in to nuclear blackmail. If now the world does not show strength and decisiveness to defend one nuclear power station, it will mean that the world has lost. Any radiation incident at the Zaporizhzhia NPP can affect the countries of the European Union, Turkey, Georgia and countries from more distant regions. Everything depends solely on the direction and speed of the wind. If Russia’s actions cause a catastrophe, the consequences may also hit those who remain silent so far.” Ukrainian and Russian officials reported shelling near Europe’s largest nuclear plant on Monday with both sides blaming each other. One Russian-installed regional official said 25 heavy artillery strikes from US-made M777 howitzers had hit near the plant and residential areas. Ukraine said it was Russian forces that had shelled the city to try to make it appear that Ukraine was attacking it. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

The UN says it has the logistics and security capacity to support a visit by experts. Five Europeans face trial on mercenary charges in separatist-controlled Donetsk, Ukraine. Mathias Gustafsson of Sweden, Vjekoslav Prebeg of Croatia, and Britons John Harding, Andrew Hill and Dylan Healy all pleaded not guilty to charges of being mercenaries and “undergoing training to seize power by force”, according to Russian media reports. They could face the death penalty under the laws of the self-proclaimed, unrecognised Donetsk People’s Republic. Three civilians were killed and two wounded by an explosive device while swimming in the Black Sea in the Ukrainian southern region of Odesa, local police said. People working on a construction site reportedly ignored barriers and warning signs on a beach in the Belhorod-Dnistrovskyi district and went swimming in the sea. Three men aged 25, 32 and 53 were killed and another man and a woman were wounded, police said. The British military is training 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers in marksmanship, battlefield first aid and urban warfare. British trainers aim is to turn raw recruits into battle-ready soldiers in a matter of weeks. The first batch arrived last month and have already been sent back to replenish depleted Ukrainian units. Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Nordic nations have also sent trainers. The Moscow-appointed administration in Ukraine’s Kherson region plans to hold a referendum on 11 September, according to Kremlin sources. Referendums are also planned in three other Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia – where Moscow aims to annex the territories and declare them to be a new region of Russia.

The UK is one of Europe’s largest users of CO2. What is CO2 used in? CO2 is widely used across the food industry in production and packaging, and is of particular importance to the meat sector. The gas is essential for the humane slaughter of livestock as it is used to stun pigs and chickens. It is also widely used in the packaging of fresh meats, fresh produce such as salad and baked goods, where CO2 slows bacteria growth and extends the shelf life of the products. CO2 is widely used in fizzy drinks and beer and is also vital to cooling systems used to refrigerate products. It is also used to create dry ice, which can be used to keep food fresh for storage and transport. Meanwhile, the food industry says that the gas can encourage the healthy growth of vegetables in greenhouses, and can be used to purify drinking water. Surgeons use the gas to stabilise body cavities during operations, and to freeze off warts and moles. How do you make CO2? Carbon dioxide is created as a byproduct during the industrial manufacture of ammonia, alcohol and fertilisers, as well as being emitted by power plants. The UK currently emits around 350m tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, and is preparing to take major steps to driving this figure down to net zero by 2050. So fears of a CO2 shortage could at first glance appear to be good news. However, to produce carbon dioxide which is pure enough to be used in fizzy drinks, food packaging and abattoirs, specialist equipment is required to capture, purify and separate gases. In the UK, it is most often chemical companies that are equipped to produce food-grade CO2 rather than fossil fuel power plants. How did the UK become reliant on two plants? Until recently, the UK’s food industry has been able to rely on a steady supply of carbon dioxide from two fertiliser plants in the north of England for up to 60% of its CO2. So the shock decision by owner US firm CF Industries to shut the plants prompted serious concerns. The concentration of so much CO2 production in the hands of a single owner – as part of a joint venture established in 2007 – was investigated at the time by the Competition commission, according to industry body the Food and Drink Federation (FDF). The commission insisted on certain remedies to address the reduction in competition in supply of the gas. Currently, a further 20% of the UK’s carbon dioxide is produced by other plants in the UK, and the remainder is imported from overseas. Could the UK rely on imports? Approximately 20% of the UK’s carbon dioxide is imported, mostly from plants in Scandinavia and the Netherlands. However, soaring energy prices are also having an impact on European firms. A number of sizeable EU fertiliser companies are also stopping or significantly cutting back their production, either for scheduled maintenance or as a result of rocketing costs, which will mean a considerable reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide produced on the continent. This could also further squeeze UK supplies. Can the UK become self-sufficient; could new technology help? Brewers had their fingers burned by the global shortage of carbon dioxide in 2018, which occurred during a football World Cup, a key moment for sales of beer. As a result, many of the industry’s largest players have invested in new technology in the past few years, which allows them to capture CO2 produced during the fermentation process, store it, and then re-use it to carbonate their beer. More widely, there are hopes of wider industry adoption of carbon capture and storage technology. This would involve storing carbon dioxide captured from power plant emissions beneath the North Sea, but academics believe it could also be repurposed as food-grade CO2. However, these future technologies will come as cold comfort to the food industry this winter. • This article was amended on 23 September 2021 to clarify that CO2 slows the growth of bacteria in food rather than preventing them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-criticises-putin-for-dangerous-nuclear-rhetoric-donbas-town-of-avdiivka-post-apocalyptic","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-27T18:00:17Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Putin’s plan to station nuclear weapons in Belarus ‘irresponsible’ and ‘escalatory’, says Germany","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-criticises-putin-for-dangerous-nuclear-rhetoric-donbas-town-of-avdiivka-post-apocalyptic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-criticises-putin-for-dangerous-nuclear-rhetoric-donbas-town-of-avdiivka-post-apocalyptic","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Putin’s plan to station nuclear weapons in Belarus ‘irresponsible’ and ‘escalatory’, says Germany","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s ground forces commander has said his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi’s comments signalled again Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll there. At least two people have been killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk on Monday, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko said, adding that a number of high-rise buildings and offices were also damaged or destroyed. President Zelenskiy posted a short video clip that showed vehicles on fire and debris strewn across the road. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, has said he had met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Zaporizhzhia, the region that houses Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since early in the invasion. The two had a “rich exchange” on the protection of the plant and its staff, Grossi said, adding that he reiterated the IAEA’s full support for Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. President Zelenskiy visited frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia on Monday, his office said, during a visit to one of the partly occupied regions that the Russian Federation claims to have annexed as part of its own territory. Zelenskiy “visited advanced positions in the Zaporizhzhia region, learned about the operational situation, and presented awards to the military”, his office said. The 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks promised by Germany to support Ukraine have been handed over at the Ukrainian border, according to a report. About 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles have also reached Ukraine, Der Spiegel reported, citing unnamed sources. Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow had made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. A German foreign ministry spokesperson has described Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus as “irresponsible” and “escalatory”. Berlin sees Moscow’s announcement as “another attempt at nuclear intimidation and we consider this rhetoric to be irresponsible and expressly reject it,” Andrea Sasse told reporters in Berlin. Members of a recently formed Russian assault unit say their commanders deployed troops to stop them from retreating and threatened them with death after they suffered “huge” losses in eastern Ukraine. In a video addressed to President Vladimir Putin, a group of about two dozen men in military uniform say they are the remnants of Storm, a unit under the defence ministry. The chair of Ukraine’s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, has told British lawmakers that Kyiv is ready to send its pilots to be trained in the use of western fighter jets. Stefanchuk, speaking during a visit to the UK, said Kyiv could bring “joint victory for Ukraine and the world” once it “gets the wings”, in language echoing that of President Volodymyr Zekenskiy’s speech to the British parliament last month. A leaked phone conversation allegedly between prominent the Russian music producer Iosif Prigozhin and the billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov, in which the two men give a far-ranging criticism of the war in Ukraine and Russia’s leadership, has been published by Ukrainian media. If confirmed genuine, the audio would provide a rare insight into the mood within the Russian elites. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland has said, after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it planned to let them compete as neutrals. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors have said. The arrest comes after Poland dismantled a Russian espionage network that had been preparing acts of sabotage and monitoring rail routes to Ukraine. If found guilty, the suspect could face up to 10 years in prison. Hungary’s parliament has approved a bill to allow Finland to join Nato, bringing the Nordic country one step closer to becoming a full member of the western military alliance. Hungarian lawmakers voted 182 for and only six against with no abstentions. Turkey is now the only one of Nato’s 30 members not to have ratified Finland’s accession. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. We’ll be back tomorrow. Thank you. Video released by a Russian assault unit details what they describe as ‘criminal’ commands to block a retreat following 14 days of nonstop mortar fire and shelling. Alexander Gorin, a Russian soldier, is heard describing the conditions of the Storm group, which initially had 161 members, in an appeal to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. Read the full story here: A United Nations expert advising the International Olympic Committee has provoked outrage by claiming that Russian soldiers who have fought in Ukraine should be allowed to compete at the Paris 2024 Games – as long as they have not committed war crimes. Alexandra Xanthaki, the UN special rapporteur for cultural rights, angered Ukrainian athletes on an IOC‑hosted call by saying that only Russians implicated directly in crimes against humanity or propaganda for war should be barred from international sport. “I don’t think that it makes sense to exclude all Russian soldiers and all Russian military,” Xanthaki told athlete representatives from most of the 206 national Olympic committees. It is discriminatory because there were a lot of other athletes [from other countries] … in active military operations and they were never excluded. However, every athlete has to be excluded if they are found guilty of atrocity, of serious human rights violations in times of war, including crimes against humanity and genocide. And also they can be excluded if they are found guilty of propaganda for war but on an individual basis. It is unclear how far the IOC will follow her advice at an executive board meeting on Tuesday, which is expected to offer updated guidelines to sports about how Russian and Belarusian athletes can qualify for Paris. The Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych, who was on the call, said: Her comments sounded pretty insane. And it was clear from the questions she received that many others were shocked that she was advocating a way for Russians to compete despite their illegal war. Heraskevych, who held up a sign saying “No war in Ukraine” at the Winter Olympics last year before the invasion of his country, said Xanthaki’s knowledge of sport also appeared limited. Read the full story here: Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires of the aftermath of a Russian missile strike in Ukraine’s eastern city of Sloviansk. At least two people have been killed and 29 wounded by Monday’s attack, according to the head of the Donetsk regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko. Hungary’s parliament has approved a bill to allow Finland to join Nato, bringing the Nordic country one step closer to becoming a full member of the western military alliance. Hungarian lawmakers voted 182 for and only six against with no abstentions, ending months of foot-dragging by the ruling Fidesz party on the issue. With Hungary’s approval, Turkey is now the only one of Nato’s 30 members not to have ratified Finland’s accession. The bill on Sweden’s Nato accession remains stranded in the Hungarian parliament. Video released by Ukraine’s presidential office and the country’s emergency services show destruction in the eastern city of Sloviansk after a deadly strike by Russian forces, which killed at least two people and injured dozens more. A number of high-rise buildings and offices were also damaged or destroyed, local leader Pavlo Kyrylenko said in an online statement. The city is in the partly occupied Donetsk region, the scene of fierce fighting since the start of the war more than a year ago. A German foreign ministry spokesperson has described Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus as “irresponsible” and “escalatory”. Berlin sees Moscow’s announcement as “another attempt at nuclear intimidation and we consider this rhetoric to be irresponsible and expressly reject it,” Andrea Sasse told reporters in Berlin. She added: We will, of course, not be swayed in our course of supporting Ukraine in its self-defence. The Russian president said on Saturday that he was acting after negotiations with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, who he said had “long raised the question” of a nuclear deployment on his country’s territory. Sasse also dismissed a report about the imminent expulsion of 30 Russian diplomats, saying “such a measure is currently not planned”. A giant recruitment advert for Russia’s mercenary Wagner group has appeared on an office building next to a highway in north-east Moscow, showing the group’s logo and slogans such as “Join the winning team!” and “Together we will win”. Wagner, which is thought to have sustained heavy losses in the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, has sought to replenish troops before a potential Ukrainian counteroffensive, Reuters reports. Iuliia Mendel, a former spokesperson for Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has shared a video clip of the Ukrainian president meeting troops in frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia earlier today. Zelenskiy said he held a meeting to discuss the “operational situation, readiness of military units to perform assigned tasks, socioeconomic situation in the region, meeting the needs of internally displaced persons” during his visit to Zaporizhzhia region. Members of a recently formed Russian assault unit say their commanders deployed troops to stop them from retreating and threatened them with death after they suffered “huge” losses in eastern Ukraine. In a video addressed to President Vladimir Putin, a group of about two dozen men in military uniform say they are the remnants of Storm, a unit under the defence ministry. “We sat under open mortar fire and artillery for 14 days,” Alexander Gorin, a Russian soldier, is heard saying in the appeal, which first appeared on Friday on Russian Telegram channels. We took huge losses. Thirty-four people were injured and 22 died, including our commander. Another soldier said the unit initially comprised 161 men at the start of the operations. Gorin said his men made the decision to head back to the Russian army headquarters but were denied evacuation by their superiors: They placed barrier troops behind us and weren’t letting us leave our position … They are threatening to destroy us one by one and as a unit. They want to execute us as witnesses of a completely negligent criminal leadership. Read the full story by my colleague Pjotr Sauer here: It’s 6pm in Kyiv.

A Russian-installed official in the occupied territory was cited by state-run Tass news agency as saying: “In the morning they blew up the car of police chief Mikhail Moskvin. He is alive, everything is in order.” A Russian diplomat has said Moscow may seek compensation for the damage to the Nord Stream gas pipelines caused by two explosions last September, according to state media. The pipelines were ruptured by unexplained blasts that Moscow has – without providing evidence – accused the west of being responsible for. The Kremlin said it was for all shareholders to decide whether the two pipelines should be mothballed.

Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow had made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland has said, after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it planned to let them compete as neutrals. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors have said. The arrest comes after Poland dismantled a Russian espionage network that had been preparing acts of sabotage and monitoring rail routes to Ukraine. If found guilty, the suspect could face up to 10 years in prison. Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukrainian media last week published a 30-minute leaked phone conversation allegedly between the prominent Russian music producer Iosif Prigozhin and billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov, in which the two men give a far-ranging criticism of the war in Ukraine and the Russian leadership. Akhmedov, a former Russian senator, has been targeted by western sanctions for his proximity to the Kremlin regime, while Prigozhin (no relation to Wagner group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin) is seen as a longtime supporter of the Kremlin. “There’s no doubt about the fact that they fucked up the country,” a man whose voice closely resembles that of Prigozhin’s says on the recording. The same man also refers to Putin’s inner circle as “washed-up lowlifes” who act as if they are “gods”. “He is Satan. Totally vacuous,” Akhmedov allegedly said of Putin. He screwed all of us over. Everyone and everything. The entire country. The entire population, for fuck’s sake. It was not possible to independently verify the clip’s veracity, Prigozhin on Sunday called the audio a “provocation” aimed at “creating a split” within the Russian elites. While initially calling the clip “fake news”, Prigozhin in a later reaction said that the clip contained “some real moments” from his conversation with Akhmedov. “The voice is similar to mine. But it is not clear how the call was glued together. We need to figure it out,” the producer said. Akhmedov has not yet commented on the recording. If confirmed genuine, the audio provides a rare insight into the mood within the Russian elites, many of whom have privately voiced their opposition towards the war. Der Spiegel is reporting that the 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks promised by Germany to support Ukraine have been handed over at the Ukrainian border. About 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles have also reached Ukraine, the report added, citing unnamed sources. In January, the German government announced it would supply Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, overcoming misgivings about sending heavy weaponry that Kyiv sees as crucial to defeat the Russian invasion. Berlin’s decision paved the way for other countries to re-export some of their German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, said on Monday he had met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Zaporizhzhia, the region that houses Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. The power plant has been occupied by Russian forces since almost the very beginning of the Russian invasion. The two had a “rich exchange” on the protection of the plant and its staff, Reuters reports that Grossi wrote in a tweet, adding that he reiterated the IAEA’s full support for Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. Adding to his previous message on Telegram, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has given his account of a meeting held while he was visiting to Zaporizhzhia region. Ukraine’s president posted: Meeting on the situation in Zaporizhzhia: operational situation, readiness of military units to perform assigned tasks, socioeconomic situation in the region, meeting the needs of internally displaced persons. The regional leadership of the security service and the national police of Ukraine delivered reports. We are working and keeping all important issues under control. The first images have come in of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to Zaporizhzhia region today. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia today. Citing the president’s office, it said Ukraine’s president “visited advanced positions in the Zaporizhzhia region, learned about the operational situation, and presented awards to the military”. Zaporizhzhia is one of the partially occupied regions that the Russian Federation claims to have annexed as part of its own territory. Zelenskiy himself posted to his Telegram channel a video clip of him meeting soldiers, alongside the message: I visited the command post of the “Zaporizhzhia” operational group of troops. I presented orders and medals to employees of the security service of Ukraine, the national guard, the national police, the state border guard service, and the state emergency service of Ukraine. Thank you for protecting our state, our homes, territorial integrity and life in Ukraine. I wish you good health. I wish you a great victory and it will definitely come true. Here are some drone images from Bakhmut that were released at the weekend showing the extent of the destruction of the city, which had a population of about 70,000 before the start of the war. A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian-appointed social worker in the liberated eastern city of Lyman to five years in prison after finding her guilty of collaborating with Russian authorities, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said. The unnamed accountant at Lyman’s department of social protection and labour was accused of registering a local tax office, treasury and social insurance fund with the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, as well as recruiting workers and paying them salaries in rubles. Ukrainian forces recaptured Lyman in September, after which the official was arrested. Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s security council, has warned that Moscow has the weapons to destroy any enemy, including the US, if its own existence is threatened. Patrushev, in an interview with the state Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper, said: American politicians trapped by their own propaganda remain confident that, in the event of a direct conflict with Russia, the United States is capable of launching a preventive missile strike, after which Russia will no longer be able to respond. This is shortsighted stupidity, and very dangerous. He added: Russia is patient and does not intimidate anyone with its military advantage. But it has modern unique weapons capable of destroying any adversary, including the United States, in the event of a threat to its existence. A quick snap from Reuters: the Kremlin has denied Turkish reports that Vladimir Putin planned to visit the Turkish capital, Ankara. The chair of Ukraine’s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, also used his visit to the UK to call for the creation of a special tribunal to investigate Russia’s war crimes. “We want to use all the legal mechanisms to make sure Russia is defeated legally, held accountable for all the crimes they commit in Ukraine,” he said, adding that the crimes were “not real if they are not prosecuted”. Addressing MPs and peers, he called for the UK to recognise the Soviet-era Holodomor famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the winter of 1932-33 as genocide, and said it was “connected” to today’s crimes. The Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, welcomed his Ukrainian counterpart to Westminster, telling him: “Our parliament is your parliament.” He added: Ukrainian politicians play a vital role in serving their people and telling the world the reality of war. We are a friend that will listen, we are a friend that will support and continue to support. Ukraine is ready to send its pilots to be trained in using western fighter jets, the chairman of Ukraine’s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, has told British lawmakers. Stefanchuk, speaking during a visit to the UK, said Kyiv could bring “joint victory for Ukraine and the world” once it “gets the wings”, in language echoing that of President Volodymyr Zekenskiy’s speech to the British parliament last month. He said: We are ready for more intense training of Ukrainian servicemen. We’re ready to send our pilots to be trained in fighter jets. We keep saying ‘please give us your experience’. He also thanked the UK for its decision to send 14 Challenger 2 tanks, which paved the way for other nations to follow suit. He added: Today is the time for Britain to become a leader to also open the door to use aircraft and long-range rockets. At least two people have been killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration, said in a Facebook update. A number of high-rise buildings and offices were also damaged or destroyed, he said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier said that one person had died in the shelling in Sloviansk. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukraine presidency’s office, has tweeted about the meeting with the Unicef goodwill ambassador and British actor, Orlando Bloom. A Russian diplomat has said Moscow may seek compensation for the damage to the Nord Stream gas pipelines caused by two explosions last September, according to state media. The pipelines are multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects designed to carry Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea. They were ruptured by unexplained blasts that Moscow has – without providing evidence – accused the west of being responsible for. The US and Nato have called the incident “an act of sabotage”. Dmitry Birichevsky, head of the Russian foreign ministry’s department for economic cooperation, told state-owned Ria Novosti news agency: We do not rule out later raising the issue of compensation for damage as a result of the explosion. He did not say who Russia would seek damages from, but added: At the moment, it’s very difficult to speak about the future of the Nord Stream pipeline system. On the whole, according to experts, the damaged lines could be restored. The Kremlin has said it is for all shareholders to decide whether the two pipelines should be mothballed. Russia would establish who was behind the blasts before claiming any compensation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said today. Peskov said: For now, the data indicates that such a large-scale act of sabotage and a terrorist attack against critical infrastructure could not have been carried out without the participation of the state and special state services. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires from the frontline near the besieged city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine’s ground forces commander said on Monday his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Ukraine’s military said Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi had acted during a visit to the eastern frontline to solve “problematic issues that prevent effective execution of combat tasks” and taken “operational decisions aimed at strengthening our capabilities to deter and inflict damage on the enemy”. It gave no details, and did not say when the visit took place, but Syrskyi’s comments signalled again Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll there. Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to his official Telegram about the death of at least one person in an attack on Slovyansk. Ukraine’s president wrote: “Another day that began with terrorism by the Russian Federation. The aggressor state shelled our Slovyansk. Unfortunately, there is a dead person and victims of various degrees of severity. All services are working on the ground. Help is being provided.” Russian forces launched two missile strikes, 23 airstrikes and 38 attacks from rocket salvo systems against Ukrainian troops and infrastructure in populated areas, according to the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. The secretary of Russia’s security council, Nikolai Patrushev, has said Nato countries are party to the conflict in Ukraine, according to excerpts from an interview with the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta on Monday. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying reports that an attempt was made this morning to assassinate the police chief in occupied Mariupol. It quotes a Russian-installed official in the occupied territory saying: “In the morning they blew up the car of police chief Mikhail Moskvin. He is alive, everything is in order.” RIA reported that Ukrainian forces shelled the Kalininsky district in the occupied city of Donetsk. “There are victims,” it said, without specifying further. There have also been explosions reported in occupied Melitopol, which Vladimir Rogov, a local Russian-installed leader, ascribed to the work of air defence. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors said on Monday. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland said on Monday. Belarus is accusing Poland of heightening tensions between itself and the EU by deliberately slowing the movement of trucks and cars at its border. Belarus says Poland is failing to implement bilateral agreements. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland said on Monday, after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it planned to let them compete as neutrals. “We strongly believe that now is not the time to consider the opening up of a pathway for Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to the Olympic Games in any status,” Reuters reports the Polish foreign ministry said in a statement. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying reports that an attempt was made this morning to assassinate the police chief in occupied Mariupol. It quotes a Russian-installed official in the occupied territory as saying: “In the morning they blew up the car of police chief Mikhail Moskvin. He is alive, everything is in order.” The source informed Tass that the car exploded a few metres away from the police chief. There have also been explosions reported in occupied Melitopol, which Vladimir Rogov, a local Russian-installed leader, ascribed to the work of air defence. The claims have not been independently verified. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors said on Monday. Reuters reports prosecutors in the northern Polish city of Gdansk said in a statement that the suspect was detained on 21 March. “The findings made in the case show that the suspect acted for the benefit of Russian intelligence by obtaining and collecting information … on critical infrastructure in the Pomeranian and Kuyavian-Pomeranian regions, and on the activities of services and bodies responsible for security,” they said. “The information obtained was passed on to the Russian intelligence service,” the statement added. The arrest comes after Poland dismantled a Russian espionage network that had been preparing acts of sabotage and monitoring rail routes to Ukraine. If found guilty, the suspect could face up to 10 years in prison. The state-owned Russian news agency RIA reports on Telegram that Ukrainian forces have shelled the Kalininsky district in the occupied city of Donetsk. “There are victims,” it reports, without specifying further. A video clip appears to show smoke rising over the city. The claims have not been independently verified. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to his official Telegram about the death of at least one person in an attack on Slovyansk. Ukraine’s president wrote: Another day that began with terrorism by the Russian Federation. The aggressor state shelled our Slovyansk. Unfortunately, there is a dead person and victims of various degrees of severity. All services are working on the ground. Help is being provided. Debris clearance is ongoing. The enemy must know: Ukraine will not forgive the torturing of our people, will not forgive these deaths and wounds. All Russian terrorists will be defeated. Everyone involved in this aggression will be held to account. The message was accompanied by a short video clip that showed vehicles on fire and debris strewn across the road. The claims have not been independently verified. Belarus is accusing Poland of heightening tensions between the country and the EU by deliberately slowing the movement of trucks and cars at its border. Belarus says Poland is failing to implement bilateral agreements. “Since Friday, a queue in front of the only accessible border crossing point on the Belarusian-Polish border, Kozłowiczy, has doubled in size and now totals 1,000 cars,” Reuters reports the country’s border committee said. Ukraine’s ground forces commander said on Monday his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Reuters reports Ukraine’s military said Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi had acted during a visit to the eastern frontline to solve “problematic issues that prevent effective execution of combat tasks” and taken “operational decisions aimed at strengthening our capabilities to deter and inflict damage on the enemy”. It gave no details, and did not say when the visit took place, but Syrskyi’s comments signalled Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll there. “The most intense phase of the battle for Bakhmut continues. The situation is constantly difficult. The enemy suffers significant losses in human resources, weapons and military equipment but continues to conduct offensive actions,” he said. Praising Ukrainian forces’ resilience in “extremely difficult conditions”, he said: “The defence of Bakhmut is due to military necessity … We are calculating all possible options for the development of events, and will react adequately to the current situation”. The secretary of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, has said Nato countries are party to the conflict in Ukraine, according to excerpts from an interview with the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta on Monday. Reuters reports Rossiyskaya Gazeta quoted Patrushev as saying: “In fact, Nato countries are a party to the conflict. They made Ukraine one big military camp. They send weapons and ammunition to the Ukrainian troops, provide them with intelligence”. The deputy foreign ministers of Russia, Turkey, Iran and Syria may hold consultations in Moscow in early April, Reuters reports, citing RIA. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that yesterday Russian forces shelled the Zaporizhzhia region 14 times. Zaporizhzhia is one of the partially occupied regions of Ukraine that the Russian Federation claims to have annexed as its own territory. Russian forces launched two missile strikes, 23 airstrikes and 38 attacks from rock salvo systems against Ukrainian troops and infrastructure in popular areas, according to the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. In its latest update, it claimed Russian forces are focusing their main efforts on conducting offensive actions in the Kupyansk, Lymansk, Bakhmutsk, Avdiivsk and Marinsk directions, with Ukrainian soldiers claiming to have repelled more than 60 enemy attacks. The Ukrainian air force made three strikes on Russian troops. Ukrainian missile and artillery units also claimed attacks on a command post, four Russian troop concentrations, weapons and military equipment, a radio-electronic ware station and an ammunition depot. The claims have not been independently verified. Unicef goodwill ambassador and British actor Orlando Bloom has met President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to promote the organisation’s humanitarian work in Ukraine. During the meeting, Bloom said he was “impressed” by the courage and resilience of Ukrainians and Zelenskiy welcomed the work of Unicef, saying the safety of children and their development remain a priority of his government. Bloom also visited Irpin and the village of Demydiv during his tour. Unicef is working to develop a statement to care for children whose parents have been killed in the war and infrastructure for early childhood development, youth projects and start-ups. Russia plans to complete coastal infrastructure needed to host nuclear submarines in the Pacific Ocean, Tass news agency reported on Monday. The nuclear submarines will be capable of carrying the Poseidon nuclear-capable super torpedos first produced in January, four years after they were announced. There are few confirmed details about the Poseidon in the public domain, but it is essentially a cross between a torpedo and a drone which can be launched from a nuclear submarine. The torpedoes are being developed for deployment on the Belgorod and Khabarovsk nuclear submarines, Tass reported. Russia Pacific Fleet’s ballistic nuclear missile submarine base is located on the south-eastern coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, in the Russian far east. The Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Okhotsk make up the Kamchatka Peninsula’s eastern and western coastlines. The Tass state agency reported that a new division is being formed as part of the submarine forces of the Pacific Fleet, which will include not only Belgorod and Khabarovsk but also other submarines. The new special-purpose submarines will participate in solving the tasks “of strategic deterrence”. Reuters With the cost of reconstruction in Ukraine projected by the World Bank to be $411bn, economist Adam Tooze has examined the changes to the Ukrainian economy that have been forced on it over the course of the invasion. To secure ongoing support from international institutions like the International Monetary Fund, Tooze notes the Ukrainian government has committed to deep and widespread reforms that would cut labor protections and introduce austerity measures across the economy. Quoting other sources, Tooze writes that Ukraine has “outsourced” most functions of its government beyond what is needed to carry out the military defence of the country - and that this “nightmarish” decision will have consequences for civil society over the long run. A policy of dramatic fiscal austerity that comes at the expense of the fabric of Ukrainian society and the state will have huge long-run costs. The EU, the United States and other outside supporters can soften this dilemma best a. by providing more generous funding and b. by urging Kyiv towards a strategy of civilian as well as military state-building, not by replacing domestic national institutions with international agencies, but by promoting the mobilization of local institutions and agencies. The U.N. nuclear watchdog head will not travel to Russia this week, but a visit is possible in the near future, Russian news agency RIA reported early on Monday, citing Moscow’s permanent representative to international organisations in Vienna. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi announced on Saturday that he would visit the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine this week to assess the serious situation there. When asked if Russia planned to invite Grossi to Moscow in the near future, permanent representative Mikhail Ulyanov said that was “quite realistic”, according to RIA. Not next week, but somewhat later, the visit of Rafael Grossi to Russia may well take place. Grossi is pressing for a security zone to be erected around Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant with six reactors, which has come under repeated shelling during the 13-month war Russia has been waging against its neighbour. - Reuters The ISW also said the continuing of offences around Bakhmut and Avdiivka have become “not merely pointless, but actually harmful to Russian preparations for the next phase of this week”. It said the loss of manpower and equipment means Russian forces will not gain any operational advantage from taking either Bakhmut and Avdiivka as they will be “unable to exploit such advances”. Putin’s continuation of these Russian offensive operations in the current operational and strategic context amounts to strategic malfeasance. It expends scarce Russian combat power in pursuit of operationally meaningless gains rather than setting conditions to receive and defeat a Ukrainian counter-offensive that everyone appears to expect imminently. However, the ISW said Putin’s “stubbornness” could make sense “in a protracted conflict during which western support for Ukraine wanes or ends”. Putin might even mean these operations to set conditions for a negotiated settlement on terms he has already articulated that include international recognition of Russia’s annexation of all of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts; Ukrainian “neutrality”; the “de-militarization” of Ukraine; and the “de-Nazification” of the Ukrainian government. The ISW said “multiple major Ukrainian operational-level victories” would be necessary to create “any prospect of a negotiated settlement of the current conflict or forcing Putin to accept unfavorable militaries realities, absent a formal settlement”. The Institute for the Study of War says even a successful series of Ukrainian counteracts may not be enough to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the conflict. In an abbreviated update, the ISW says Putin remains committed to carrying out the military campaign in an effort to “seek complete victory in Ukraine”. Putin instead remains focused on achieving his initial war aims through protracted conflict in which he wins either by imposing his will on Ukraine by force or by breaking Ukraine’s will following the West’s abandonment of Kyiv. It said “multiple successful Ukrainian counteroffensives are almost certainly necessary but not sufficient” to persuade Putin to enter into a negotiation for the end of the war. Instead the Russian President appears to be “doubling down” on the war by continuing to mobilising his country’s industrial base and relying on various shadow-mobilisation schemes to generate the necessary combat power. Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. The Russian president’s suggestions that the move would not breach non-proliferation agreements and that it was consistent with similar arrangements that the US has with several of its European allies was given short shrift in Kyiv. Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, called the deal “a step towards internal destabilisation” of Belarus, and said it maximised what he termed the level of “negative perception and public rejection” of Russia and Putin in Belarusian society. “The Kremlin took Belarus as a nuclear hostage,” he wrote on Twitter. For more on this story, read the full report by Dan Sabbagh, Sam Jones and Julian Borger. Nato says Vladimir Putin’s plan to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus is “dangerous and irresponsible” and a threat to Russia’s nuclear non-proliferation commitments. Putin likened his Belarus plan on Saturday to the US stationing its weapons in Europe, insisting Russia would not violate its nuclear non-proliferation promises. The move, while not unexpected, is one of Russia’s most pronounced nuclear signals yet and a warning to Nato over its military support for Ukraine. Nato spokesperson Oana Lungescu said on Sunday: “Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible”. Nato is vigilant and we are closely monitoring the situation. We have not seen any changes in Russia’s nuclear posture that would lead us to adjust our own.” Putin’s non-proliferation pledge and his description of US weapons deployment overseas were way off the mark, she added. Russia’s reference to Nato’s nuclear sharing is totally misleading. Nato allies act with full respect of their international commitments. Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments. Experts said Russia’s move was significant since it had until now been proud that unlike the US, it did not deploy nuclear weapons outside its borders. It may be the first time since the mid-1990s that it has done so. Reuters Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine – this is Royce Kurmelovs bringing you the latest developments. Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric after Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Ukraine has reacted to Russia’s plans by calling for an emergency meeting of the UN security council. The head of Ukraine’s national security and defence council has said that the Kremlin has taken Belarus as a “nuclear hostage”. More on that shortly. Elsewhere, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged Ukrainians to remain engaged in the war, even though fighting has largely been concentrated in the east. Over the last 24 hours, Zelenskiy has met with security services, intelligence and defence to discuss reinforcement and “prepare respective steps”. He also said Ukraine has received €1.5bn in macro-financial assistance from the European Union. Meanwhile heavy Russian shelling is turning the Ukrainian town of Avdiivka into a “place from post-apocalyptic movies”, according to the city’s military administration head, Vitaliy Barabash. Reuters reported about 2,000 civilians were left in the city that Ukrainian forces said last week could become a “second Bakhmut”. The city’s prewar population numbered 30,000. In other developments: The UN Nuclear watching head will not visit Russia this week, but another visit is possible in the future. International Atomic Energy Agency Director announced on Sunday he would visit the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant in occupied-Ukraine, but said a visit to Russia was being planned for “somewhat later”. Zelenskiy said the Croatian government had adopted a programme to treat wounded Ukrainian soldiers. The number of Russian troops in Belarus has decreased to about 4,000, according to Ukraine. Andriy Demchenko, spokesperson for the State Border Guard Service, said there had been 10,000 in January. The majority of those remaining were training, with the rest transferred back to Russia. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, has cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons. “Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation and threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” The US national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said on Sunday: “We have not seen any indication that he [Putin] has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around.” Three people were reported injured and three residential buildings were damaged after an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region. Local law enforcement attributed the blast to a Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV drone “packed with explosives”. None of the people hurt in the blast were believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, Putin has said in a televised interview broadcast. Putin said the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-373-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-03T18:39:26Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 373 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-373-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-373-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 373 of the invasion","bodyText":"Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner group, has called on President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to order a withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut. Bakhmut is “practically surrounded” by Wagner fighters with only one route left for Ukrainian forces, Prigozhin said in a video published today. The video has been geolocated to the village of Paraskoviivka, 4.3 miles north of the centre of Bakhmut. Ukrainian forces have blown up a railway bridge inside the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, according to a report. Video of the controlled explosion, posted on social media and geolocated by CNN, was shared widely today along with unconfirmed reports that it was a sign that Ukraine was preparing to withdraw from the city. Russia is deploying the most experienced units of the mercenary Wagner group and the country’s army in an attempt to seize the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, the Ukrainian military has said. The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, was pictured visiting the frontline city on Friday for briefings with local commanders on how to boost defence capacity. Ukraine has ordered a mandatory evacuation of families and vulnerable residents from Kupiansk and adjacent northeastern territories, amid fears that Russian forces will retake the frontline eastern city and rail hub. Russian troops retreated from key cities in the northeastern Kharkiv region, including Kupiansk, and Ukraine recaptured it last September. The evacuation order was due to the “unstable security situation” caused by Russia’s “constant” shelling of the town and its surroundings, the Kharkiv regional military administration said. Foreign ministers of the so-called Quad group denounced Russia’s threat to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war as unacceptable, according to a statement issued after a meeting on Friday. The ministers also said they opposed any unilateral actions to increase tensions in the South China Sea, and expressed concerns about the “militarisation” of disputed territories, in a thinly veiled reference to China. The Quad group includes India, Australia, Japan and the United States. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the office of the president of Ukraine, has again issued a denial that Ukraine has mounted any attacks within Russian territory. President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday Russia had been hit by a “terrorist attack” in Bryansk, and vowed to crush what he said was a Ukrainian sabotage group that had fired at civilians. Ukraine accused Russia of staging a false “provocation”. The Kremlin said Friday it would take measures to prevent a repeat of what it described as a border incursion. Ten people remain considered missing and five people ar enow known to have died when a missile hit a residential building in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Thursday morning. Volodymyr Litvinov, head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson, has reported that a tractor driver has been killed by Russian shelling in the area. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian proxy who operates in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region has claimed on Telegram that Ukrainian forces are shelling Enerhodar, the city which stands next to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is also reporting military action at the ZNPP, stating “Employees of the security agencies of the Russian Federation came under aimed fire on the line of contact when meeting International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors who were rotating at the ZNPP.” Belarus has sentenced the Nobel peace prize-winning dissident, Ales Bialiatski, to 10 years in prison as part of Alexander Lukashenko’s purge of opponents after the 2020 pro-democracy protests against his rule. Bialiatski, a pro-democracy activist, is the founder of Viasna, the authoritarian country’s most prominent human rights group. He was detained in July last year and charged with smuggling cash into Belarus to fund his group’s activities, but is widely recognised as being persecuted for his opposition to Lukashenko. Bialiatski was awarded the Nobel peace prize alongside the Russian human rights organisation Memorial, and the Ukrainian human rights organisation Center for Civil Liberties, in October. Joe Biden, the US president, and Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, will focus their discussions in Washington on Friday on war aid for Ukraine and may also touch on concerns that China may provide lethal aid to Russia, a senior US administration official has said. The US has announced a new military aid package of ammunition and other support for Ukraine worth $400m (£333m). The package will be funded using presidential drawdown authority, which authorises the president to transfer articles and services from US stocks without congressional approval during an emergency, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. The US is hosting war planning exercises in Germany for Ukrainian military officers to help them think through battlefield decisions in the next phase of the conflict, officials have said. Switzerland’s defence ministry on Friday said it had received a request from its German counterparts to allow Rheinmetall AG to acquire some of Switzerland’s mothballed Leopard 2 tanks. The request said the tanks would not be sent to Ukraine, but would be used to backfill gaps created by the handover of Leopard 2s by Germany and Nato and EU allies. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday that Russia “will not let the west blow up gas pipelines again” and said that Moscow would no longer rely on the west as an energy partner. Mikhail Abdalkin, a member of the Samara regional Duma, has been charged with “discrediting the Russian armed forces” and will go on trial on 7 March. Abdalkin posted a photograph of himself on Telegram on 21 February listening to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s state address with what appeared to be noodles draped over his ears."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/17/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-236-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-17T13:24:40Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 236 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/17/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-236-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/17/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-236-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 236 of the invasion","bodyText":"At least four people have been killed and three others hospitalised after a series of “kamikaze” drone attacks on Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a dead woman was recovered from the rubble of a house in Shevchenkiv district, where an explosion has occurred as a result of a drone attack. He identified two other victims as “a young couple, a husband and wife who were expecting a child. The woman was six months pregnant”. Another person is under the rubble, he added. Search and rescue operations are ongoing. Earlier, Kitschko said 18 people had been rescued, and that there had been five explosions after 28 drones had been directed at the city. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal said: “Today, Russia again attacked civilian and energy facilities in Ukraine. Apartment building in Kyiv is among the terrorists’ targets. People are injured. The world’s response to these crimes must be clear: more support for Ukraine and more sanctions against the aggressor.” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said after the new wave of drone attacks that Russia should be expelled from the G20 group. Iran said again on Monday that it had not provided Russia with drones to use in Ukraine. “The published news about Iran providing Russia with drones has political ambitions and it is circulated by western sources. We have not provided weaponry to any side of the countries at war,” Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said. EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc would look for “concrete evidence” about the participation of Iran in Russia’s war on Ukraine. The European Union has agreed to create a mission to train 15,000 Ukrainian soldiers and will also provide a further €500m to help buy weapons for the war-torn country under Russian attack. EU foreign ministers meeting on Monday approved the two-year training mission, which will involve different EU forces providing basic and specialist instruction to Ukrainian soldiers, in locations in Poland and Germany. Officials hope the mission, which is expected to cost €107m, will be up and running by mid November. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, has posted to Telegram to say that the night in the Ukrainian-controlled area of the region “passed relatively calmly”. Maksym Marchenko, governor of Odesa, has said that overnight air defences in his region shot down six kamikaze drones. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has said that one person has died and two people have been wounded by Russia strikes on the region in the last 24 hours. The regional governor of the eastern region of Sumy, Dmytro Zhyvytsky, has said that three people were killed and nine more injured in a rocket attack this morning. Russian news agency Tass is reporting that buses are once again allowed to cross the Crimea bridge, which was damaged in an attack a few days ago. The UK Ministry of Defence says in its latest update that Russia is “likely” facing more acute logistical challenges as a result of the Kerch bridge bombing on 8 October. “A large queue of waiting cargo trucks remains backed up near the crossing,” the ministry reports. Denis Pushilin, the self-styled leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in occupied eastern Ukraine has announced a swap of 110 prisoners will take place on Monday. The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, has said the partial mobilisation will be completed in Russia’s capital from 2pm on Monday. The operator of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) has said it has again been disconnected from external power supply as a result of Russian shelling. Israeli officials have refused to comment on remarks from Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president, that Tel Aviv is preparing to supply military aid to Ukraine. In a Telegram message on Monday, Medvedev, currently deputy chair of Russia’s security council, warned Israel against arming Kyiv, calling it a “a reckless move” that would “destroy relations between our countries”. Despite numerous attempts from Kyiv to buy Israeli aerial defence systems since the war broke out, Israel has tried to maintain a neutral stance in the seven-month-old invasion, as it relies on Russia to facilitate its operations against Iranian-linked actors in Syria. Marina Ovsyannikova, the former Russian state TV journalist who staged an on-air protest against the war in March, has fled the country according to her lawyer. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its economic fallout have thrown 4 million children into poverty across eastern Europe and central Asia, the UN children’s agency, Unicef, has said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Sunday a “very severe” situation persists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with the “most difficult” fighting near the town of Bakhmut. The attacks came as Russia’s war in Ukraine nears the eight-month mark. Pro-Kremlin officials on Sunday blamed Ukraine for a rocket attack that struck the mayor’s office in Donetsk, a city controlled by the separatists, while Ukrainian officials said Russian rocket strikes hit a town near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, among other targets. More than 30 settlements across Ukraine have been hit by Russian strikes in the last day, according to the Ukrainian military. Two schools in the southern Zaporizhzhia region were reportedly destroyed in the strikes, which targeted civilian areas. The Ukrainian military said the estimated number of Russians killed since the start of the war has reached 65,000. Sunday morning’s update from the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said the death toll had risen by 300 over the last 24 hours. In Ukraine, 423 children have been killed since the start of the invasion the office of the Ukrainian prosecutor general said. It added that a further 810 children had been injured in the conflict and that the highest number of child casualties were in the regions of Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Kyiv. Ukraine has succeeded in maintaining its energy stability after Russian attacks last week that targeted key parts of its infrastructure, Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal said. In a post on Facebook, Shmyhal said that in the first three days of the week, Russia launched up to 130 missile and drone strikes against civilian and energy facilities, particularly in the capital, Kyiv. Russia is “probably incapable of producing advanced munitions at the rate they are being expended”, according to the latest update from the UK Ministry of Defence. The ministry said attacks like those launched across Ukraine on 10 October, in which Russia fired over 80 cruise missiles, represent a “further degradation of Russia’s long-range missile stocks, which is likely to constrain their ability to strike the volume of targets they desire in future”. US and allied security officials believe Iran has agreed to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles and attack drones intended for use in Ukraine. The topic is due to be discussed by EU foreign ministers in a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. In a statement, the Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, “emphasised that the Islamic republic of Iran has not and will not provide any weapon to be used in the war in Ukraine”. The Belarusian defence ministry has said just under 9,000 Russian troops will be stationed in Belarus as part of a “regional grouping” of forces to protect its borders. Last week, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said his troops would be deployed with Russian forces near the Ukrainian border as part of a “joint grouping”, citing what he said were threats from Ukraine and the west."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/aug/25/nuclear-energy-is-anything-but-clean","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-25T17:06:42Z","webTitle":"Nuclear energy is anything but clean | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/25/nuclear-energy-is-anything-but-clean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/aug/25/nuclear-energy-is-anything-but-clean","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear energy is anything but clean","bodyText":"Re your report (Nuclear storage plans for north of England stir up local opposition, 23 August), it is no surprise that ongoing discussions to choose locations for the dumping of nuclear waste are cloaked in secrecy. Over the last decade, the nuclear power industry has successfully rebranded an appallingly toxic energy industry as “zero carbon” and even “clean” (Zero-carbon electricity outstrips fossil fuels in Britain across 2019, 1 January 2020) by never mentioning the terrible legacy of nuclear waste. Nuclear energy is neither clean nor zero-carbon when you consider its complete fuel cycle, from uranium mining overseas to the energy-intensive production of fuel rods to the management of highly toxic radioactive waste products such as plutonium. The nuclear lobby has done a very effective PR job in diverting attention away from everything other than the electricity feed into the National Grid. It knows that there is no safe long-term solution for storing nuclear waste – how could you guarantee safety from the most dangerous chemical element on the planet for 24,000 years (the half-life of one of the plutonium isotopes typically present in nuclear waste)?

The 17 signatories to the appeal include the Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich, a Belarusian author who writes in Russian. She won the Nobel prize for literature in 2015 for writing described as “a monument to courage and suffering in our time”. Another dozen distinguished authors from around the world, including the Nobel laureate JM Coetzee, have backed the appeal. It comes as the Russian government cracked down on access to news and information about the invasion of Ukraine by blocking websites and effectively closing broadcast outlets. Access to the BBC, Radio Liberty and the German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle has been restricted after Russia’s parliament passed a law making it an offence to spread “fake” information about the armed forces. On Thursday, one of Russia’s last independent news outlets, TV Rain, stopped broadcasting after coming under pressure for its coverage of the invasion, which is thought to have left hundreds dead. The Russian writers say: “We are appealing to everyone who speaks the Russian language. To people of all nationalities. To those who are native speakers. To those for whom Russian is their second or third language. “Today the Russian language is being used by the Russian state to ignite hatred and justify the shameful war against Ukraine. In Russian, the official media keep repeating endless lies that are creating a smoke screen around this aggression. “Russian people have been fed lies for many years. The independent sources of information have been almost entirely destroyed. The opposition leaders – silenced. The state propaganda machine is working with all its might. “In this situation it is critical to reveal to the Russian citizens the full truth about the Russian aggression against Ukraine. About the suffering and losses of the Ukrainian nation. About civilians being targeted and killed. About the danger to the whole European continent. And possibly to the whole of humanity, given the fact of nuclear threat. “You speak Russian. It matters. Please, use all possible means of communication. Phones. Messengers. Emails. “Reach the people you know. Reach the people you don’t know. Tell the truth. If Vladimir Putin is blind and deaf, maybe the Russians will listen to those who speak the same language. This wrongful war should be stopped.” As well as Alexievich, the Russian authors are: Vladimir Sorokin, one of the most popular writers in modern Russian literature; Lyudmila Ulitskaya, the 2014 winner of the Austrian state prize for European Literature; the science fiction writer Dmitry Glukhovsky; the satirist Victor Shenderovich; the poet Maria Stepanova; Alexander Ilichevsky, who won the Russian Booker prize in 2007 for his novel Matisse; Mikhail Shishkin, who won the Russian Booker in 2000; Maxim Osipov, a cardiologist as well as a writer; Sergei Lebedev; Liza Alexandrova-Zorina; Sascha Filipenko; Alisa Ganieva; Viktar Martinovich; Alexander Genis; Lev Rubinstein; and Boris Akunin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/apr/03/the-big-idea-will-fusion-power-save-us-from-the-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-03T11:30:16Z","webTitle":"The big idea: will fusion power save us from the climate crisis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/03/the-big-idea-will-fusion-power-save-us-from-the-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/apr/03/the-big-idea-will-fusion-power-save-us-from-the-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"The big idea: will fusion power save us from the climate crisis?","bodyText":"One look at your energy bills this winter might have convinced you that the 1950s idea that electricity would, in the near future, become “too cheap to meter” was not so much a false promise as a sick joke. That over-excited claim was prompted by hopes that nuclear fusion – the process triggered in an uncontrolled manner in hydrogen bombs – would soon be harnessed for power generation. In the type of nuclear power we have today, disintegration of radioactive atoms such as uranium produces heat but also a troublesome legacy of radioactive waste that will stay active for millennia. Fusion power plants would instead generate energy using the same process that powers the sun: fusing of the dense nuclei of hydrogen atoms, releasing some of the formidable energy held in the atomic nucleus, with only helium as the byproduct, and without the pollution. Today the allure of fusion energy lies not so much in its price as its almost negligible carbon emissions, and therefore its potential to save us from the ravages of global heating. But will it arrive in time to stop the planet frying? There are plenty of uncertainties and unknowns around fusion energy, but on this question we can be clear. Since what we do about carbon emissions in the next two or three decades is likely to determine whether the planet gets just uncomfortably or catastrophically warmer by the end of the century, then the answer is no: fusion won’t come to our rescue. But if we can somehow scramble through the coming decades with makeshift ways of keeping a lid on global heating, there’s good reason to think that in the second half of the century fusion power plants will gradually help rebalance the energy economy. Perhaps it’s this wish for a quick fix that drives some of the hype with which advances in fusion science and technology are plagued. Take the announcement last December of a “major breakthrough” by the National Ignition Facility (NIF) of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. The NIF team reported that, in their efforts to develop a somewhat unorthodox form of fusion called inertial confinement fusion (ICF), they had produced more energy in their reaction chamber than they had put in to get the fusion process under way. Problem solved? Sadly not. As NIF scientists readily admitted, the energy generated by super-intense laser needed to spark fusion was less than a hundredth of the total amount of energy consumed by the lasers themselves. So they still have to do about a hundred times better to break even. And that’s even before factoring in the energy losses in converting the heat created by fusion into electricity. What’s more, the hi-tech pellets containing special forms of hydrogen used as fuel each cost more than $100,000, whereas a working ICF reactor would need to burn up 10 pellets a second at a cost of less than $1 each. ICF has so far been little studied as a source of energy anyway; NIF’s principal mission is to study nuclear reactions in order to help maintain the US stockpile of atomic weapons. Most work on fusion energy uses a different approach called magnetic confinement, in which the fuel – at temperatures of around a hundred million degrees, several times hotter than the centre of the sun and fiery enough to melt any material instantly – is suspended by magnetic fields, typically in a large doughnut-shaped chamber called a tokamak. Making and operating such a device raises eye-watering engineering challenges, with which fusion scientists and technicians have been grappling for decades. Many current hopes are pinned on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (Iter) being built in southern France. As the name suggests, Iter won’t be a power plant – it is strictly an experimental facility, its goal being to solve some of the engineering problems so that we can work out what a commercial fusion plant should look like. The construction of Iter’s massive tokamak started in 2013 (the project itself began in 1988) – but the facility is already way over budget (the current estimated cost is €20bn) and behind schedule. When a further delay in Iter was announced in January – it might not switch on until 2035 or so – some cynics wheeled out the old saw that fusion is perpetually just 20 years away. But such setbacks are to be expected when you consider the magnitude of what’s being attempted: to make a piece of a star on Earth. Not all of the fusion eggs are in this one basket. The EU is planning a smaller prototype plant called Demo. Another, called Sparc, is now being built in Massachusetts in a collaboration between MIT and the private fusion company Commonwealth Fusion Systems. China, Japan and Russia have their own plans, and there are several dozen private companies worldwide with ambitious goals. All the same, most fusion experts believe we’ll be lucky to have a prototype plant producing a net gain by 2040, and it’s unlikely that fusion energy will be going into the grid in significant amounts before 2050. When fusion start-ups announce that they’ll have a working reactor generating power within a decade, it’s a message for investors, not a realistic promise. These companies will have their part to play – not as the plucky underdogs who crack the problem but as providers of parts and expertise in the fusion industrial ecosystem. All the same, some researchers worry that over-promising could foster complacency that stymies investment in the urgently needed stopgap alternatives to fossil fuels, such as renewables and nuclear fission. The Soviet fusion pioneer Lev Artsimovich once said that humankind would have fusion energy “when society needs it”. In one sense he was sadly mistaken: we needed it years ago, before the lethal heatwaves, the wildfires, the shrinking ice caps. But it’s not too much to hope that we will have it before we make the planet uninhabitable, and that it can eventually turn the climate crisis into a catastrophe averted. Cynicism about fusion is cheap, but the progress is undeniable, and even exciting – so long as we keep it in perspective.

Chris O’Shea said he believed that some suppliers were “poorly capitalised”, and risked going bust and “taking taxpayer money with them”. Under the Energy Price Guarantee, introduced by Liz Truss, energy suppliers are handed government money upfront to cover the difference between wholesale energy costs and the EPG, which keeps typical household bills at about £2,500. O’Shea told the Guardian “We’ve got these poorly capitalised companies, there’s a risk if you give them extra money in advance. What happens if there’s another failure and they take taxpayers money with them? Our view is that we should be responsible for administering the government schemes and they should reimburse us after we’ve uncovered the expenditure.” A spike in the wholesale price of gas exposed the weak balance sheets of almost 30 suppliers since the start of the energy crisis last year. O’Shea said he believes “we will see some supplier failures” this winter and that some companies may be trading while technically insolvent. He has argued that energy suppliers should have tougher rules on the amount of cash they hold and that customers’ deposits should be ringfenced. Energy regulator Ofgem ignored the latter call last week. It is understood O’Shea wrote to the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, before the EPG was implemented asking for suppliers to be paid in arrears. O’Shea was speaking at the Easington gas terminal near Hull on the east Yorkshire coast, which began processing new gas injected into the huge Rough offshore storage site in the North Sea on Tuesday for the first time since 2017. Easington, which can process 20% of Britain’s peak gas needs, is where gas from Rough is brought on shore and put into the grid. Low wind and solar activity in the UK on Tuesday meant that the vast undersea cavern was called into action amid jitters over Britain’s energy capacity this winter. Centrica has reopened the site for gas storage at 20% of its previous capacity after a request from the government earlier this year. The use of the site for storage was deemed uneconomic in 2017, and it has been used as a production facility for natural gas since. Centrica has been discussing making a £150m investment to double the gas storage in Rough to 60bn cubic feet by next winter with the government. O’Shea said the company was also prepared to invest up to £2bn to convert the Rough facility to hold hydrogen in as little as five years with a funding mechanism that would guarantee revenues if wholesale prices dropped. “We’re looking for the right regulator framework that supports the investment to make sure that the returns justify the £2bn,” he said. As the government confirmed its investment in the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk, O’Shea reiterated the company’s interest in the £30bn project. Centrica has a 20% stake in Britain’s existing nuclear fleet, which is run by Sizewell C developer EDF. “We need to see the terms of that deal [between government and EDF]. We’re a partner in Sizewell B. Once we’ve seen the terms we’ll discuss that as a board. It’s in line with our strategy – it’s zero-carbon electricity generation,” O’Shea said. Asked about the impact of the toughened windfall tax on oil and gas and a new levy on electricity generators, O’Shea said: “We will review our investments based on the factors in play just now, but you also have to take a view of the risk of those things changing and undoubtedly that is heightened at the moment given what we’ve seen in the past few months.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/11/can-germany-economy-minister-keep-the-lights-on-this-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-11T11:48:49Z","webTitle":"Can Germany’s economy minister keep the lights on this winter?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/11/can-germany-economy-minister-keep-the-lights-on-this-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/11/can-germany-economy-minister-keep-the-lights-on-this-winter","fields":{"headline":"Can Germany’s economy minister keep the lights on this winter?","bodyText":"That Robert Habeck, Germany’s economy minister in his recent, pre-ministerial life, wrote a children’s book in which a girl called Emily experiences “how exciting a night-time power cut can be” may yet come back to haunt him. These days, Habeck is charged with the daunting task of ensuring that the lights do not go out in for real in Europe’s largest economy. And even if Germans have been hoarding candles and camping stoves, just as not so long ago they were doing with toilet paper and pasta, they consider the prospect of a blackout and cold homes to be scary rather than exciting. Reports of people illegally felling trees for fuel have brought back memories of postwar squalor, when Berlin’s Tiergarten park was stripped bare as Germans tried to keep warm. But a blackout is not so unrealistic since Moscow closed down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline more than a week ago. Habeck was in danger of appearing more than a little triumphalist when he remarked to the Bundestag on Thursday that “we’ve now been independent of Russian gas for a week”; it was not him, or Germany, but Putin who reduced Moscow’s leverage on Europe via energy supplies. While the cutoff may perhaps have helped to ease a little the conscience of many Germans who have felt that every time they turned on the shower they were supporting Russia’s war, more responsibility lies on Habeck’s shoulders right now than any other minister, even Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He must also try to keep the economy going amid gloomy predictions that owing to soaring energy costs and high inflation the country will slide into recession next year. Bakers in northern Germany on Thursday turned off their lights in protest at the way they had been excluded from the government’s unwieldy sounding Energiekostendämpfungsprogramm, to provide help towards the bills of energy intensive industries, from glass to wallpaper manufacturers. “Lights today, ovens tomorrow?” was the slogan posted on the door of a bakery in the well-to-do Hamburg district of Blankenese. “Bread could yet become a luxury good that only rich people can afford,” the owner said, desperate for recognition that her gas provider had cancelled her contract and she was facing a monthly gas bill that had gone from €3,800 (£3,300) to €8,000. Just a few months ago many people were regularly glancing at the coronavirus figures. These days it’s the Gasspeicher-Füllstand – gas storage filling level – that attracts feverish attention. On Friday the 47 subterranean facilities around the country were 87% full, thanks to imports from other countries, namely Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. It sounds high but is only part of the picture as when full, the facilities hold just 28% of the total amount of gas Germany uses in an average year. The aim is for 95% capacity by 1 November, but a harsh winter or any technical mishaps could cause the stores to empty well before winter is out. And there is also next winter to think of, when the stores will probably be empty with no Russian gas in sight. Industry has already reduced its usage by more than a fifth (but with consequences – ammonia production is down by about 70%) and is currently “saving” about 300 gigawatt hours a day. Considering gas use can shoot up to 5,000 GWh on cold winter days, this is just a drop in the ocean. Energy specialists say that despite Scholz’s insistence that Germany would have enough energy to get through the winter, it is too early to be optimistic. Already in a colder than usual September, consumption has been higher than expected. Households are being urged to reduce their consumption by about 20% but the expected higher household bills that might encourage savings have in many cases not yet landed on the doormat. The government, careful not to appear alarmist, has done little so far to encourage domestic saving and the focus has instead been on turning swimming pool temperatures down or switching off illumination of the Brandenburg Gate. Habeck has frequently made a point of saying that he has reduced his showers to a minimum and fitted a water-saving shower head, but is also wary of appearing condescending. Hope lies in the liquid gas that Germany expects to receive via two state-chartered floating terminals at Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbüttel, due to go into operation at the turn of the year, and a third by a private consortium in Lubmin. Energy market experts warn however that demand for LNG could be fierce in winter, particularly from Asia. A mild winter could have a significant impact but pressure is now growing on the coalition government from within its own ranks – the pro-business FDP – and the opposition conservatives, for a reversal of Angela Merkel’s 2011 commitment made in response to the Fukushima disaster to withdraw from nuclear power. Habeck, a leading member of a Green party whose founding principles were its outright opposition to nuclear power, had tried to depoliticise the decision over whether to keep three remaining plants on beyond a scheduled switch-off in December, with a stress test involving national grid operators concluding that the danger of energy blackouts could not be excluded, so two of three plants should be placed in emergency standby mode. The decision has attracted ridicule and scorn: Green supporters are wary this might mark the slow return to nuclear and, added to the schlamassel, a Yiddish-derived term for a mess, one of the plant’s operators has called the plans “technically unworkable”.

How the Tories spent two months going backwards","bodyText":"Such has been the political chaos over the last two months that it has felt as if there hasn’t been a single week without a major government U-turn. There is a good reason for that – there hasn’t been. Since the start of September, the Truss and Sunak administrations have so far averaged well over one significant U-turn a week. Here are some of the most notable reversals: Truss Energy price guarantee Having said that “handouts” are not the answer to cost of living issues, Liz Truss promptly changed her tune by announcing a massive scheme to curb energy bills for two years. 45p tax rate Abolishing the top rate of tax was the main rabbit out of the hat in the now infamous mini-budget. As the subsequent turmoil began to unfold, it was the first measure ditched by Truss. Medium-term fiscal plan Despite repeated reassurances that the government’s full economic plans would not be revealed until late in November, it was then hastily moved forward as markets continued to panic. Corporation tax With a crisis escalating and her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng sacked, Truss also abandoned her plan to stop corporation tax rising from 19% to 25% – another key pledge in her leadership campaign. Windfall tax Having said she opposed the imposition of windfall taxes on energy firms, Truss announced a de facto windfall tax on energy firms – but only those generating low-carbon electricity. The move came after they benefited from high wholesale power prices. National insurance The Tory manifesto pledged to raise cash for the NHS and social care through a levy – effectively an increase in national insurance. Truss U-turned on this by sticking by her leadership pledge of reversing the rise. Mini-budget In one of the most astonishing reversals in British political history, new chancellor Jeremy Hunt effectively ditched the entire mini-budget, or what was left of it. Promised income tax cuts were gone. The energy price guarantee was cut back. Sunak Jerusalem embassy Truss signalled she was ready to follow Donald Trump’s lead by moving the UK’s embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Sunak has now abandoned those plans. Northern Powerhouse rail Truss vowed to plough ahead with a new high-speed line connecting northern England, including a Bradford stop and eventually spanning the width of the country. However, Sunak and his team now want something much smaller. Sizewell C The first U-turn came when a government insider suggested that plans to build a new nuclear power plant in Suffolk could be delayed or scrapped. Yet there was a U-turn on the U-turn, as Downing Street later confirmed it would go ahead. Cop27 Having signalled he was not attending the meeting with world leaders, Sunak changed his mind and said that, actually, he wanted to galvanise the talks. He changed his mind after it was revealed Boris Johnson was attending the summit. Autumn statement Exactly when the government will reveal its economic plans in full has been subject to an extraordinary litany of U-turns, the latest being to delay it again until mid-November. Online harms bill The long-promised and very delayed bill designed to improve online safety is still going through, but plans to deal with language that is “legal but harmful” are being dropped. Northern Ireland elections Having signalled that it would order fresh elections in Northern Ireland to end the political paralysis there, it has now said that there will not be an election before Christmas to avoid further political turmoil."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/oct/15/inquiry-to-question-whether-australia-needs-nuclear-industry-to-support-submarine-program","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-15T01:47:07Z","webTitle":"Nuclear agencies say it’s too early to know what infrastructure is needed to support submarine program","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/15/inquiry-to-question-whether-australia-needs-nuclear-industry-to-support-submarine-program","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/oct/15/inquiry-to-question-whether-australia-needs-nuclear-industry-to-support-submarine-program","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear agencies say it’s too early to know what infrastructure is needed to support submarine program","bodyText":"Nuclear agencies say it is too early to speculate what legislative and infrastructure changes need to be made to support a nuclear-submarine project. A senate economics committee inquiry into naval shipbuilding has been running for two years, but a public hearing on Friday was the first since the federal government announced its intention to acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. Independent senator Rex Patrick called the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation to appear. The agencies were quizzed over what nuclear infrastructure and industry would be needed to support the project, and what laws would need to be changed – however, they took most of those questions on notice. Ansto did confirm it was consulted in March about the plan to buy nuclear-powered submarines, about six months ahead of September’s surprise announcement. “Initial conversations started in March and we had a number of consultations between then and the announcement,” chief executive officer Shaun Jenkinson said. Arpansa chief executive officer Carl-Magnus Larsson said his agency was briefed on the plan at the end of June or beginning of July. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said there are no plans to develop a civil nuclear industry to support building submarines. He and defence say the nuclear reactors – which will be procured from the United States or the United Kingdom as part of the Aukus agreement – will not need refuelling, and therefore a domestic industry is not necessary. Ahead of the inquiry, Patrick said: “It’s just unimaginable, it’s beyond comprehension that someone could suggest we’d be operating a nuclear operator in a submarine in a hands-off manner. “I also want to understand what safety regime they understand to be necessary for this to be carried out,” he added. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said having nuclear submarines without an industry to support them would be “more plug and pray” than “plug and play”. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute defence analyst Marcus Hellyer said Australia may not need nuclear power plants or facilities to enrich uranium, “but we’ll still need to perform maintenance and repair on the submarine, including the reactor”. “You can’t have an effective military capability if you need to return it to the US any time there is a defect,” he said. Patrick has pointed out that there are no countries with nuclear submarines that do not have a domestic nuclear industry. “Either way there would be nuclear reactors sitting on hard-stands at Osborne and moored in the Port River,” he said. “Acquiring, operating and maintaining a nuclear submarine fleet without a domestic nuclear power industry is a challenge that must not be underestimated.” Labor senator Kim Carr said there would have to be “extensive onshore facilities” to train people in case there’s an emergency, or a malfunction. “I’d be interested to know how this can be done without the development of the various sustainment industries.” “We’d need to have intensive training of all personnel to understand the linkages between the reactor and all the other bits of the boat,” he said. “You can’t just drop it in. It’s not like a battery in a mobile phone, everything’s connected to everything else.” Australia has a nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney for research and nuclear medicine. Australia also has about a third of the world’s uranium resources, and is working to establish a national radioactive waste management facility. Federal legislation bans the production of nuclear power, as do various state laws. Ansto has said it will work with the US and the UK “to intensively examine the requirements that underpin nuclear stewardship”, and Morrison has said their nuclear science capabilities will be needed. A Defence spokesperson said Australia, through Aukus, had “committed to working … over the next 18 months to determine the optimal pathway to deliver a nuclear-powered submarine capability for Australia”. “Australia will leverage technology, capability and design expertise from the UK and US and will also evaluate a variety of considerations, including but not limited to: submarine design, construction, safety, operation, maintenance, disposal, regulation, training, environmental protection, installations and infrastructure, industrial base capacity, workforce, and force structure,” they said. Shortly after announcing that plans to buy 12 diesel-electric submarines from France would be ditched in favour of the Aukus deal, Morrison was asked to respond to Turnbull’s comments, and those of other nuclear experts, that a supporting industry would be needed. “We may be speaking about different things here and there’s terms that are thrown about here,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/oct/25/putin-dirty-bomb-war-russian-leader-tactics","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-25T16:05:47Z","webTitle":" Putin's wild claims of a dirty bomb show just how badly his army is faring | Hamish de Bretton-Gordon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/25/putin-dirty-bomb-war-russian-leader-tactics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/25/putin-dirty-bomb-war-russian-leader-tactics","fields":{"headline":" Putin’s wild claims of a dirty bomb show just how badly his army is faring","bodyText":"Putin’s conventional army is being defeated by a much smaller force, albeit one backed by the west’s latest technology and intelligence. His ridiculous claim that Ukraine is planning to use a “dirty bomb” – an explosive device containing radioactive material – implies he is now groping towards more unconventional methods of warfare. This is unsurprising when we see how poorly the Russian army is performing, which presumably Putin is also seeing. Putin’s response has been to appoint General “Armageddon” Surovikin as his overall commander in Ukraine, and the dirty bomb allegation is right out of Surovkin’s playbook. The “dirty” bomb concept is a complete chimera – a fantasy designed to terrify people in Ukraine and allow Russia to escalate its unconventional warfare. The claim has been dismissed by France, Britain and the US, and the UN is sending inspectors at Ukraine’s request to two nuclear sites to prove it is baseless . There has never been a successful dirty bomb attack. But their psychological impact is 10 times greater than their physical effect, and Putin must be hoping this will break the will of the Ukrainians. Putin’s style of unconventional warfare relies upon making the civilian population the target rather than the opposing military. And cynically this makes sense, as his own soldiers have been found wanting against the Ukrainian army. The focus is now on attacking civilians as the soldiers fight on the frontlines: killing them on their way to work, or children on their way to school. For those injured in these attacks, the Russians then attack hospitals to prevent treatment: 500 so far in this war, according to the World Health Organisation. Russia tested and developed its unconventional warfare concept in Syria. This included the use of chemical weapons, which the Assad regime turned to whenever defeat seemed imminent. The rebels were about to storm Damascus in August 2013 when Assad dropped the deadly nerve agent sarin on the suburb of Ghouta, killing more than 1,000 people and stopping the advance in its tracks. He also broke the six-year conventional siege of Douma with chlorine barrel bombs in 2018. Weapons like chlorine and dirty bombs are morbidly effective owing to the terror they impart, and must be fully outlawed by the United Nations and the free world. Though I believe that global nuclear warfare is very unlikely, anything less is possible, especially if Putin’s vital territory of Crimea is threatened, which is looking increasingly likely. In unconventional warfare there is very much a “dirty” nuclear threat, which could be almost as devastating as a battlefield nuclear weapon, by turning nuclear power stations into improvised nuclear weapons – in essence a massive “dirty” bomb. In theory the Geneva Conventions and the rules of war outlaw unconventional warfare – but Putin and his generals seem more than willing to ignore both. The new prime minister must, with Nato allies, ensure that Putin is never able to reach for his most devastating unconventional weapons.

Ukraine’s state energy operator has warned there are “risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances” at the Russian-occupied plant. Authorities were distributing iodine tablets to residents who live near the plant in case of radiation exposure. Russia and Ukraine traded fresh accusations of each other shelling the area around the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, on Saturday. Moscow’s troops have “repeatedly shelled” the site of the plant over the past day, the Ukrainian state nuclear company, Energoatom, said. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed Ukraine’s troops “shelled the territory of the station three times” in the past day. The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is trying to negotiate access to the plant for an urgent inspection mission “to help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there”. Energoatom head Petro Kotin told the Guardian a visit could come before the end of the month, but Ukrainian energy minister Lana Zerkal told a local radio station she was not convinced Russia was negotiating in good faith. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has issued a statement marking Ukraine’s Aviation Day, in which he pledged that Kyiv’s troops would “destroy the occupiers’ potential step by step”. The Ukrainian president vowed that the Russian “invaders will die like dew on the sun”. Russia has probably increased the intensity of its attacks in the Donetsk area of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region over the past five days, according to British intelligence. Pro-Russia separatists have most likely made progress towards the centre of Pisky village, near Donetsk airport, but Russian forces overall have secured few territorial gains, the latest report from the UK Ministry of Defence says. Russia has blocked an agreement at the UN aimed at bolstering the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The failure to agree to a joint statement, due to Moscow’s objection to a clause about control over the Zaporizhzhia plant, is the latest blow to hopes of maintaining an arms control regime and keeping a lid on a rekindled arms race. Ukrainian sailors will be allowed to leave the country for work, Ukraine’s cabinet of ministers has said. The prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said men of draft age employed as crew members would be allowed to leave the country so long as they had permission from their local conscription offices to cross the border. Britain’s defence ministry has said it is giving six underwater drones to Ukraine to help clear its coastline of mines and make grain shipments safer. In addition, dozens of Ukrainian navy personnel will be taught to use the drones over the coming months, the ministry said. Kazakhstan, a neighbour and ally of Russia, has suspended all arms exports for a year, its government said, amid the conflict in Ukraine and western sanctions against Moscow. Poland and the Czech Republic have agreed to protect the airspace of their Nato ally Slovakia, as it upgrades its air force from legacy Soviet-made MiG-29 fighters to a new batch of F-16 jets from the US. The EU is set to suspend its visa travel agreement with Russia this week, The Financial Times reports. The plan to freeze a 2007 deal will make it harder and more expensive for Russians to get Schengen-area documents, the FT reports. It comes after some eastern member states threatened to unilaterally close their borders to Russian tourists, with other countries calling for collective action to stop ordinary Russians from travelling to the EU on tourist visas. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has previously called for a complete ban. Russia claims it has hit workshops at the Motor Sich factory in the Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine. The facility is where helicopters for the Ukrainian air force are being repaired, the defence ministry said. But Ukrainian officials later said the hit resulted significant civilian damages, damaging nine multi-storey buildings and 40 private homes. A Russian missile has struck military infrastructure in Rivne oblast in northern Ukraine. Reports so far are that there were no casualties, and that the missiles came from just over the border from Belarus. The United States called out Russia’s “cynical obstructionism” after Moscow remained the sole holdout in blocking the adoption of a joint declaration on nuclear non-proliferation following lengthy negotiations at the United Nations. The 191 signatories review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty every five years, which aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and promote cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. But on Friday, Russia prevented the declaration’s adoption, saying it took issue with “political” aspects of the text. It is unclear whether Russia will try to boost its armed forces by recruiting more volunteer “contract” soldiers or by lifting annual targets for conscriptions, British intelligence says. President Vladimir Putin signed a decree this week to increase the size of the armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million in the wake of the country’s invasion of Ukraine, now in its sixth month. The latest UK Ministry of Defence briefing says that under the Russian legislation now in place, the decree is unlikely to make “substantive progress” towards increasing Russia’s combat power. Two people were killed when Russia fired on Bakhmut, the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Saturday. The eastern city is a significant target for Russian and separatist forces seeking to take control of the parts of Donetsk they don’t hold. Associated Press also reported local government officials as saying that in the Black Sea region of Mykolaiv, one person was killed and another wounded in Russian firing. On the opposite shore from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the towns of Nikopol and Marhanets were hit by shells on Saturday afternoon and evening, Nikopol’s mayor, Yevhen Yevtushenko, said on Telegram."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/aug/31/nuclear-energy-is-key-in-fight-for-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-31T16:30:30Z","webTitle":"Nuclear energy is key in fight for climate | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/31/nuclear-energy-is-key-in-fight-for-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/aug/31/nuclear-energy-is-key-in-fight-for-climate","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear energy is key in fight for climate","bodyText":"The letter on nuclear energy (25 August) sadly could not be more wrong – nuclear is one of the cleanest fuels we have, and has always been so. The carbon and material footprints of nuclear – for its entire lifetime, including mining and decommissioning – are lower than solar and on a par with wind, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Moreover, the nuclear industry manages its waste stream – that is more than can be said for the solar industry, which is set to produce millions of tons of toxic waste. Besides, spent nuclear fuel is not “waste” but a valuable source of low-carbon energy that can be recycled via reprocessing or proposed breeder reactors, thereby neutralising the vast majority of the radioactivity. At a time when we need every tool in the box to fight the climate crisis – and nuclear is one of the most effective – isn’t it time we started to look at the facts rather than repeat myths about nuclear waste?

This small town – Schastia in Ukrainian – has been out of the headlines since Moscow took its brutal war against civilians to the country’s biggest cities. But it is here, and in nearby Volnovakha, that the illegal tactics of terrorising civilians for military aims, honed in Syria and then brought back so close to home, have reached a grim high point. There have been terrible strikes on homes, schools and hospitals around Ukraine. But residents of both towns say the barrage of shelling, rocket assaults and airstrikes since the start of the war has damaged or destroyed nearly every building in their towns, a comprehensive devastation as yet unmatched elsewhere. The Russian flag has now been raised over the ruins of Schastia. In Volnovakha, the attack is still so intense that dead bodies lie uncollected, says local MP Dmytro Lubinets. Ukrainians still brave enough to run rescue missions are going back only for the living. Thousands of them are trapped in basements, with dwindling supplies of food and water, sheltering from an apparently senseless attack on a town Lubinets says has no military defenders in its centre. The line of contact is 20km away, he says. “It never stops, every five minutes there is a mortar landing or artillery shells, some buildings have been hit by multiple rocket systems,” he said by phone. “In the city there is not any building which has not suffered from direct or collateral damage. So some buildings have major destruction, some minor destruction, some are completely destroyed to the ground.” On Friday morning, Ukrainian media claimed that a Russian war plane bombing “residential areas and civilian infrastructure” in the area was shot down. Pavlo*, a Schastia native who evacuated his family, said 80% of the town was damaged in an intense bombardment that lasted days, and as in Volnovakha, barely any buildings were entirely untouched. “People started evacuation after three days, when Russian forces stopped bombing the town and people could leave the shelters,” he said. “People didn’t have water, gas, electricity for three or four days because of the bombing. They used all kinds of their weapons, Grad rockets, artillery and mines.” The devastation in larger cities such as Chernihiv and Kharkiv is deadly and terrible, but has still affected only a relatively small portion of the towns, even if the terror it instils casts a shadow over every civilian still trapped there. But what Russian forces appear to show in these smaller towns is that they are willing to leave behind them a wasteland on a massive scale, as they did in Grozny in Chechnya, or – together with Syrian forces – in the ancient city of Aleppo. Neither humanity nor heritage stopped them. Attacking civilians, and the infrastructure that supports life including hospitals and schools, is illegal under international law. It has no direct strategic advantage for an advancing army. But it is extremely effective at breaking morale of a resisting population. The “I love Volnovakha” sign in the centre of town, which has survived somehow, has a backdrop of ruined houses. It appears at the start of a video, filmed from a moving car, which captures crumpled shops, buildings blackened by fire, and a road strewn with debris. Before the war, the population of the town was 25,000. Lubinets says at least 3,000 people are trapped, but possibly many more. Hundreds of them are children. Requests for a humanitarian evacuation corridor have gone unanswered, so the military and other volunteers are risking their lives to bring people out in small groups. “We drive under fire to the places where people mostly concentrated, schools, hospitals, grab them out, put them in the car and bring them out, because the shelling never stops at any second,” he said. “Its impossible to use buses because they have low mobility. Always when you go there you will get punctures, so you just have to drive [the car] out for about 10 minutes to places where big buses can come.” For many residents of these towns, their lives are as irreparably shattered as their homes, barely a week into this war. Their suffering may be a terrible template for the damage Russia will inflict on others, if Moscow tries to pound bigger towns and cities into submission. “There was life before, and life after, and now I just feel emptiness inside,” said Iyrna*, who fled in a long, lonely journey through a succession of towns and cities under attack – first Chernihiv, then Kyiv and finally to relative safety in the western city of Lviv. “Nobody knows what is going on there.” “A friend [still in Schastia] told me: ‘I can’t even go to your place to try and collect some papers, or other things, everything there is totally smashed up,’” she said. “Ninety per cent of houses are damaged.” She was just out of hospital after major surgery when the war began, and her husband is serving on the frontline. “For three days I was in such deep stress I couldn’t eat or drink, even now they have been swept out of my memory. I was so exhausted I had hallucinations that my husband was with me.” Shastia and Volnovakha were on the frontline for eight years of the smaller-scale war between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatists, and Lubinets believes the carnage inflicted on the towns now is revenge for their resilience through those years. “From the very first day of the war they started shelling us directly … They are trying to wipe out the town,” he said. “I think someone in Russia is destroying [the town] as a reminder of what they can do to someone who doesn’t break in the face of Russian aggression.” * Name has been changed to protect family members in areas under Russian control"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/20/germany-hopes-ai-can-stop-rare-eagles-flying-into-wind-turbines","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-20T06:13:31Z","webTitle":"Can AI stop rare eagles flying into wind turbines in Germany?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/20/germany-hopes-ai-can-stop-rare-eagles-flying-into-wind-turbines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/sep/20/germany-hopes-ai-can-stop-rare-eagles-flying-into-wind-turbines","fields":{"headline":"Can AI stop rare eagles flying into wind turbines in Germany?","bodyText":"Small in size, sensitive of constitution and with only 130 breeding pairs surviving locally in the wild, the lesser spotted eagle of the Oder delta lives up to its name. In Germany, key questions over the country’s energy future hang on the question of whether artificial intelligence systems can do a better job of spotting the reclusive animal than birdwatchers do. Lesser spotted eagles (named after the drop-shaped spots on their feathers) are fond of riding thermals over many of the flatlands earmarked for a mass expansion of onshore windfarms by a German government under pressure to compensate for a pending loss of nuclear power, coal plants and Russian gas. Because lesser spotted eagles in mid-flight are unused to vertical obstacles, and keep their eyes focused on mice, lizard or frog-shaped prey below, conservationists say, they are known to occasionally collide with the rotor blades of wind turbines. German researchers list eight dead specimens found in the vicinity of windfarms since 2002, a small but not insignificant number given the species’ endangered status in the country. A controversial reform of the federal nature conservation act, pushed through by Olaf Scholz’s coalition government earlier this summer, slashes red tape around building windfarms near nesting sites, but banks on AI-driven “anti-collision systems” as one way to minimise such accidents. Software engineers in Colorado are feeding hundreds of thousands of images of the airborne clanga pomarina into an algorithm. Linked to a camera system perched atop a 10-metre tower, the trained-up neural networks of the US company IdentiFlight are expected to detect eagles approaching from a distance of up to 750 metres and electronically alert the turbine. The turbine will then take 20-40 seconds to wind down into “trundle mode” of no more than two rotations each minute, ideally giving the eagle plenty of time to navigate safe passage between its slowly moving blades. IdentiFlight spent three years testing its anti-collision systems at six supervised sites across Germany, and says its neural network boasts rates of more than 90% for recognising and classifying red kites, the first birds of prey it has been trained in for German territories. While fog, rain or snow can reduce the system’s effectiveness, the makers say, low visibility also decreases the eagles’ appetite for airborne hunting raids. The system is expected to be certified for spotting sea eagles in the coming weeks, with validation for their lesser spotted relatives scheduled for 2023. “From our point of view, the system could be a good solution,” said Moritz Stubbe, a business manager trying to bring anti-collision systems to German wind parks. “We are waiting for the green light.” The technological solution is also meant to solve a political conundrum for the Green party, the second-largest party in the three-way coalition government and driving force behind the new nature protection law. By keeping the peace between those of its supporters who define ecological politics predominantly as safeguarding biodiversity and those who prioritise mitigating the climate crisis. Wind energy in Germany underwent a massive boom after Angela Merkel announced the phase-out of nuclear power in 2011, with windfarms currently providing about a quarter of the country’s electricity needs. But the expansion plans have stalled for the past four years, at about 30,000 turbines providing just over 60,000 megawatt hours a year. Wind power companies complain that planning applications take longer and longer, with not only environmentalists but locals opposed to turbines having learned to use natural protection laws to stymie their plans. Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine upended decades of German energy policy, Scholz’s government had announced its intention to reverse the trend: it has plans to increase electricity from renewables by 80% over the next eight years, and to commit Germany’s 16 federal states to provide 2% of their landmass for wind energy over the next ten. Experts say this would amount to an additional 16,000 turbines by 2030, or 38 a week. To reach these targets, Germany’s Green-run environmental ministry has for the first time drawn up a conclusive list of 15 birds it deems at risk of colliding with turbines. Those animals that did not make the list, such as the black stork, cannot be cited to stop a planning application. But even those that did make the grade are now protected to a lesser degree. Windfarms can in the future be built outside a 1.5km radius around the nest of the lesser spotted eagle, for example, down from 3km. In the north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, conservation officers said this is likely to affect 10 nesting pairs. Wind park developers may still be obliged to take additional measures to protect the at-risk birds, such as by switching off turbines while fields in the vicinity are being harvested, thus attracting birds of prey on the lookout for newly exposed field mice. Switching off turbines for an entire breeding season, however, will no longer be allowed, and rotor blades are not allowed to be kept at standstill if the farm’s energy production is diminished by 4-8% as a result, depending on the location. “It’s a catastrophe”, said one nature protection officer who did not want to be named, suggesting the legislation was likely to be disputed and thus bog down planning applications rather than unleash turbine builders. Some lawyers argue the new act violates European environmental law; the German Wind Energy Association (BWE) vehemently disagrees. Court action looks predestined. “As a society, we have to start asking ourselves some basic questions,” said Wolfram Axthelm, BWE’s chief executive. “Do we want to build windfarms because we want to mitigate climate change and protect the environment as a whole? Or do we want to save every individual bird?” The number of birds killed by wind turbines, he said, was dwarfed by those that perished after flying into windows, being run over by cars or being caught by domestic cats. “We have to concentrate on the population as a whole.” Clanga pomarina is named after Pomerania, the historical region on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea. In Germany, the lesser spotted eagle’s population has declined by a quarter since the 1990s, not mainly due to wind turbines, but to a gradual disappearance of the woodland-meets-wetland habitats where the birds like to nest. Further to the east, in Estonia, Lithuania and Slovakia, the species is still thriving. The International Union for Conservation of Nature red list of threatened species lists the lesser spotted eagle’s global population as stable, with an estimated 40,000-60,000 mature individuals remaining in the wild."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-437-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-06T02:24:01Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 437 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-437-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-437-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 437 of the invasion","bodyText":"A prominent Russian nationalist writer, Zakhar Prilepin, was wounded in a car bombing in the region of Nizhny Novgorod on Saturday, the Russian state news agency Tass said, in an attack that Russia immediately blamed on Ukraine and the West. Tass quoted a source in the emergency services as saying the writer’s car was blown up. “He survived, but was wounded and is conscious,” the source was quoted as saying. Russia has been accused of attacking the besieged city of Bakhmut with incendiary phosphorus weapons, BBC News reported. Ukraine’s military shared drone footage of what appeared to show Bakhmut ablaze as white phosphorus rains down on the city. Ukraine’s air force has claimed to have downed a Russian hypersonic missile over Kyiv using newly acquired American Patriot defence systems, the first known time the country has been able to intercept one of Moscow’s most modern missiles. Air force commander Mykola Oleshchuk said in a Telegram post that the Kinzhal-type ballistic missile had been intercepted in an overnight attack on the Ukrainian capital earlier in the week. It was also the first time Ukraine is known to have used the Patriot defence systems. Concerns in the Russian leadership about its vulnerability to attacks and the potential for public protests over the Ukraine war have contributed to the decision to cancel many Victory Day parades, citing security concerns, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. In its latest intelligence briefing, the ministry said six Russian regions, occupied Crimea and 21 cities had cancelled their parades on Tuesday marking the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. Russia is still not satisfied with how the issue of Russian agricultural exports as part of the Black Sea grain deal is being resolved, TASS news agency quoted deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin as saying on Saturday after the latest talks with a top UN official. “We are still not satisfied with the progress. This is very important for us,” Vershinin said. He was speaking after talks in Moscow with the United Nations’ top trade official Rebeca Grynspan, TASS said. Poland will demand European Union sanctions on imports of Russian farm products, its ambassador to the EU Andrzej Sadoś was quoted as saying by PAP news agency. “Europe isn’t threatened by disruptions in supply chain of farm products now, contrary, we have a problem of surpluses. We are resolving a problem of increased imports of farm products from Ukraine,” Sadoś said, according to PAP. Switzerland’s parliament has approved a request from Ukrainian authorities for President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address it. The invitation, announced in a statement late on Friday, comes amid pressure on Switzerland’s government to break with a centuries-old tradition of neutrality and end a ban of exports of Swiss weapons to conflict zones such as Ukraine. Kherson’s weekend curfew is the latest inconvenience for residents who, after enduring months of Russian occupation last year, have been subjected to daily bombardments by Russian troops encamped nearby on the other side of the River Dnipro. Despite their retreat from Kherson city last November, Russian forces still hold large swathes of territory in the wider Kherson region that Ukraine wants to recapture, Reuters reports. Some residents left Kherson in cars and buses on Friday while others stocked up on groceries before a 56-hour curfew began on Friday evening in the southern Ukrainian city. Reuters reports that the announcement of the curfew, lasting until Monday morning, prompted speculation in Kherson that the city was about to be used as a launch point for Ukraine’s much-anticipated counterattack. Strikes on Russian infrastructure including drone attacks on refineries and train sabotage have multiplied in recent weeks, with experts suggesting they are part of Ukraine’s preparations for an expected spring offensive. Agence France-Presse reports that Kyiv has not claimed any of the acts denounced by Moscow as Ukrainian “sabotage” of “unprecedented momentum”, but the majority appear to target Russian army supply chains in border regions and in annexed Crimea, a base for Russian troops. Ukraine has sent first lady, Olena Zelenska, and Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, as the country’s representatives to UK’s King Charles’s coronation in London on Saturday. Zelenska posted on her official Facebook: “It is an honour for us and prime minister Denys Shmyhal to attend the coronation of Their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla The royal family here at Westminster Abbey to wish on behalf of all of Ukraine successful governance and prosperity to the country.” The leader of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force has said his forces will leave Bakhmut, which they have been trying to capture since last summer. Yevgeny Prigozhin said they would pull back on Wednesday 10 May – ending their involvement in the war’s longest battle – because of heavy losses and inadequate ammunition supplies, and he asked defence chiefs to put regular army troops in their place. But Ukraine said Wagner fighters were reinforcing positions to try to seize the eastern city before that date. Prigozhin earlier released a video showing him standing in a field of Russian corpses and blaming defence chiefs for the losses suffered by his fighters in Ukraine, appearing to reignite his simmering feud with Russian top brass. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has carried out an inspection of troop readiness for forces engaged in the war, in an apparent coded response to Prigozhin’s criticism. Ukraine said two people had been killed and nine wounded in the eastern Donetsk region and electricity distribution networks had been damaged by shelling in the Donetsk and Kherson regions. Authorities in the Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia have begun evacuating villages near the frontline. The Russian-installed governor, Yevgeny Balitsky, announced the move in anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive aimed at retaking the area, claiming Kyiv’s forces had “stepped up shelling of settlements close to the frontline” in the past few days. Engineers have reduced the risk of a dam bursting and damaging the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, a senior Russian official was quoted by state news agency Tass as saying on Friday. Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the general director of energy engineering firm Rosenergoatom, said specialists had begun discharging water from the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam on the Dnieper River in southern Ukraine. A Moscow court has ordered the arrest of a theatre director and a playwright on charges of “justifying terrorism” over an award-winning play about Russian women recruited online to marry radical Islamists in Syria. Director Yevgeniya Berkovich and author Svetlana Petriychuk were placed in custody until 4 July, Russian news agencies reported. Bill Clinton has said he knew in 2011 it was just “a matter of time” before the Russian president attacked Ukraine. “Vladimir Putin told me in 2011 – three years before he took Crimea – that he did not agree with the agreement I made with Boris Yeltsin,” the former US president recalled. “He said … ‘I don’t agree with it. And I do not support it. And I am not bound by it.’ And I knew from that day forward it was just a matter of time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/11/ukraine-russia-war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-has-shut-down-says-operator-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-12T01:13:25Z","webTitle":"‘You can’t scare us’, Zelenkiy tells Russia, after missile attacks on Kharkiv – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/11/ukraine-russia-war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-has-shut-down-says-operator-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/11/ukraine-russia-war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-has-shut-down-says-operator-live","fields":{"headline":"‘You can’t scare us’, Zelenkiy tells Russia, after missile attacks on Kharkiv – as it happened","bodyText":"This blog is closing now but you can catch up with the latest on the attacks on the Ukrainian gains in Kharkiv and the Russian response here: And you can follow all our Ukraine coverage here. The general commanding Russia’s western army group has been sacked in the wake of the retreat in the Kharkiv region, according to Ukrainian military intelligence. It reported on its Telegram channel that Gen Roman Berdnikov has been replaced after only 17 days in his post, the GUR said. It said: “The leadership of the western grouping of the RF Armed Forces has been removed from command. The reason for this decision is the crushing defeats received as a result of the offensive of the Ukrainian Defense Forces. His replacement is Lt-Gen Alexander Lapin, commmander of army group centre, who will now take charge of both, according to the Ukrainians. There was no confirmation of the claim from other sources. It should also be noted that in June, Ukrainian sources said Berdnikov had been killed in action. However, Russia’s defence ministry said on Telegram that its forces in the Kharkiv region had “inflicted defeat on” Ukrainian units in Pristin, Boldyrevka, Sinikha, Beloe, Komarovka, Gorokhovatka, Kupyansk, Senkovo and Podvysokoye of the Kharkov region. “More than 250 Ukrainian servicemen, 12 armored vehicles, three field artillery pieces, one multiple rocket launcher and 17 vehicles were destroyed,” it said. If you want a quick catchup on what’s been going on, check out our latest at a glance guide on day 201 of the war. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has delivered a fierce response to Russian attacks on the Kharkiv region. In a nightly message on Telegram, the Ukrainian president said that although the Kremlin was trying to deprive his people of “gas, light, water and food”, it would not succeed in defeating them. “Do you still think that you can scare us, break us, make us make concessions?” he asks in a stirring that is worth posting in full: Even through the impenetrable darkness, Ukraine and the civilized world clearly see these terrorist acts. Deliberate and cynical missile strikes on civilian critical infrastructure. No military facilities. Kharkiv and Donetsk regions were cut off. In Zaporizhia, Dnipropetrovsk, and Sumy there are partial problems with power supply. Do you still think that we are “one people”? Do you still think that you can scare us, break us, make us make concessions? You really did not understand anything? Don’t understand who we are? What are we for? What are we talking about? Lip reading: Without gas or without you? without you Without light or without you? without you Without water or without you? without you Without food or without you? without you Cold, hunger, darkness and thirst are not as scary and deadly for us as your “friendship and brotherhood”. But history will put everything in its place. And we will be with gas, light, water and food.. and WITHOUT you! Hello, good morning/afternoon/evening wherever you are in the world. I’m Martin Farrer taking over our rolling coverage of the war in Ukraine from Maya Yang. The big story of the moment is Russian missile attacks on civilian infrastructure such as power stations and water facilities in the Kharkiv region after Ukrainian forces scored a series of notable battlefield victories in the area over the weekend. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, has denounced the strikes. “Russia’s apparent response to Ukraine liberating cities and villages in the east: sending missiles to attempt to destroy critical civilian infrastructure,” Brink tweeted. Moscow denies its forces deliberately target civilians. It’s just past 2am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: “We will call it victory,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a video address on Sunday, referring to a potential Russian retreat. He added that he is confident that Ukrainian forces will liberate all Russian-occupied territories across the country. Russian forces have launched a total of 11 missiles towards the eastern regions of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Air Force announced in a tweet on Sunday night. The Ukrainian Air Forces shot down seven cruise missiles in the Dnipropetrovsk region and two more missiles were destroyed in the Poltava region, the UAF said. Due to shelling of the infrastructure, a number of trains from/to Kharkiv, Sumy and Poltava are expected to be delayed. However, not a single train today was cancelled; traffic continues on the entire railway network. Two cruise missiles hit critical infrastructure in Kharkiv and firefighters were on the scene, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration. Tymoshenko said engineers are working to restore power and electricity should soon be back in vital facilities such as hospitals. “We will call it victory,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a video address on Sunday, referring to a potential Russian retreat. “They will call [the Russian retreat] a gesture of goodwill … we will call it victory,” the president said, adding that he is confident that Ukrainian forces will liberate all Russian-occupied territories across the country. “The world is amazed by our warriors, the enemy is in a panic,” he said. Our reporters Lorenzo Tondo and Isobel Koshiw are bringing us the latest from the frontlines of Kharkiv, where Russian attacks on Sunday night damaged infrastructure facilities and power supplies across the region. Their reporting follows: Russia targeted infrastructure facilities in central and eastern Ukraine on Sunday evening in a response to a dramatic Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv province that has reshaped the war and left Moscow reeling. The mayor of Kharkiv city, Ihor Terekhov, said a strike had knocked out power and water to much of the city, in what he described as an act of “revenge” by Russia for Ukraine’s recent battlefield successes. There were reports of blackouts in Dnipro, Poltava and other eastern cities, potentially affecting millions of civilians. Volodymyr Zelenskiy blamed “Russian terrorists” for the blackouts. “No military facilities [were attacked],” the Ukrainian president said in a statement on social media. “The goal is to deprive people of light and heat.” In an early-evening update on the military situation, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukrainian forces, said Ukrainian soldiers had regained control of about 3,000 sq km of territory since the start of September, and were approaching the border in the country’s north-east. To find out more, read their latest story: Russian forces have launched a total of 11 missiles towards the eastern regions of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Air Force announced in a tweet on Sunday night. The Ukrainian Air Forces shot down seven cruise missiles in the Dnipropetrovsk region and two more missiles were destroyed in the Poltava region, the UAF said. Images have emerged of the fiery aftermath of the destruction of a critical infrastructure object in Kharkiv area. Due to shelling of the infrastructure, a number of trains from/to Kharkiv, Sumy, and Poltava are expected to be delayed. However, not a single train today was canceled; traffic continues on the entire railway network. At the stations in Kharkiv and other temporarily cut-off cities, safe disembarkation and boarding of passengers has been organized. Passengers will also be allowed to stay on the territory of the stations during the curfew. Two cruise missiles hit critical infrastructure in Kharkiv and firefighters are now on the scene, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration. Tymoshenko said engineers are working to restore power and electricity should soon be back in vital facilities such as hospitals. Power was cut to areas Russia was attempting to capture in the early weeks of the invasion. Tymoshenko confirmed that Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk and part of the Donetsk region were suffering from blackouts. Tymoshenko said power had been 100% restored in Sumy region, which neighbours Kharkiv, and that power in the Poltova region is back. “Russians want to leave us without light, water and heat.” It’s nearly 10pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: A counteroffensive is occurring in the Kharkiv region, according to the Ukrainian defense ministry. “Prepare to swim, occupiers,” the ministry said in a tweet on Sunday. Meanwhile, Russian forces have been disrupting power supply in Kharkiv, Dnipro and Poltava, the Wall Street Journal reports. A nationalist militant and former FSB officer who helped launch a 2014 war in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region compared the collapse of one of the conflict’s principal front lines to a catastrophic defeat in the Russo-Japanese war which triggered Russia’s 1905 Revolution. Igor Girkin said it was like the 1905 Battle of Mukden, which ended took place two days after the revolution started. Russian president Vladimir Putin has warned his French counterpart of “catastrophic consequences” of apparent Ukrainian attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Putin “drew attention to regular Ukrainian attacks on [the Zaporizhzhia nuclear] facilities, including a radioactive waste storage facility, which is fraught with catastrophic consequences”, according to the Kremlin, as reported by AFP. Moscow’s leadership has remained “silent” on the defeats in Ukraine, with neither Putin or the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, making any comment as of midday on Sunday. Moscow’s almost total silence on the defeat – or any explanation for what has taken place in north-eastern Ukraine – has provoked significant anger among some pro-war commentators and Russian nationalists on social media. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-appointed leader of Chechnya, has criticised the Russian army’s leadership after it appeared to be caught off-guard by Ukraine’s fightback against the Russian invasion in the north-east. In a sign that the Kremlin may face serious fallout over the loss of territory that the Russian occupation administrations had repeatedly stated they planned to keep “for ever”, Kadyrov also suggested that Vladimir Putin might not be aware of the real state of affairs. “Nobody knows” where Russian rockets will land in Ukraine after the invasion by the larger neighbor, president Voldymyr Zelenskiy said in an interview with CNN broadcast on Sunday. Talking in broken English to CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, Zelenskiy said of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, “you cannot be afraid of him” as a way of explaining why he was doing the interview while walking on the grounds of the Ukrainian presidential palace in Kyiv. Zakaria noted that previous interviews with him had been held in a bunker or similar setting. Zelenskiy noted that, morning and night, however, Russian bombs can land anywhere. Guardian’s defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh has written this analysis on how Ukraine has exploited thin Russian cover with its sweeping counter offensive, and how more gains are possible In five days, Ukraine’s northern counter-offensive has changed everything. What began as a push in a part of the front largely ignored by military analysts became an advance of 43.5 miles (70km), capturing “more territory than Russian forces have captured in all their operations since April”, according to the Institute of the Study of War. Before Wednesday, Ukraine had struggled to make much progress with offensive operations. Yet, south-east of Kharkiv, Kyiv has shown it can dynamically exploit military circumstances in its favour – opening up the prospect of further, dramatic gains before winter settles in. Russia had diverted thousands of its best combat troops to defending the southern city of Kherson, in response to a Ukrainian offensive that it said it had begun a couple of weeks ago. Exhausted by months of continuous war, the Kremlin left the sector south-east of Kharkiv lightly defended. Read more: Ukraine’s defence ministry has shared this tweet, after the 130th battalion made it to Hoptivka near the Russian border. Yaroslav Trofimov of the Wall Street Journal has said that Russian forces are disrupting the power supply to eastern Ukraine, affecting the power supply to Kharkiv, Dnipro and Poltava. Reports have suggested that Kharkiv is without power completely. A nationalist militant and former FSB officer who helped launch a 2014 war in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, compared the collapse of one of the conflict’s principal front lines to a catastrophic defeat in the Russo-Japanese war which triggered Russia’s 1905 Revolution. Igor Girkin said it was like the 1905 Battle of Mukden, which ended took place two days after the revolution started. Ukraine has hailed its rapid advance, which saw thousands of Russian soldiers flee, leaving behind ammunition stockpiles and equipment, as a turning point in the 6-month-old war. Girkin, who has been unsparing in his criticisms of the country’s top brass, dubbing defence minister Shoigu “the cardboard marshal”, has said repeatedly that Russia will be defeated in Ukraine if it doesn’t declare a nationwide mobilisation, Reuters reports. Nationalist anger at military failure is potentially a far greater problem for the Kremlin than pro-Western liberal criticism of Putin: opinion polls continue to show broad support for what Moscow calls the “special military operation”. As the capital celebrated Moscow Day with street parties and concerts on Saturday, rumblings of disquiet even spread to Russia’s ordinarily subservient parliament. Sergei Mironov, leader of the nominally opposition but Putin-loyal Just Russia party, said on Twitter that a firework display in honour of the holiday should be cancelled, in view of the military situation. One message reposted on Telegram by the prominent war correspondent Semyon Pegov referred to the celebrations in Moscow as “blasphemous” and the refusal of Russian authorities to embark on full-scale war as “schizophrenic”. “Either Russia will become itself through the birth of a new political elite ... or it will cease to exist,” it read. More on that telephone conversation between Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin (see 16:54), as the Kremlin readout has now been published. The Russian president warned his French counterpart of “catastrophic consequences” of apparent Ukrainian attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. During the call, Putin “drew attention to regular Ukrainian attacks on [the Zaporizhzhia nuclear] facilities, including a radioactive waste storage facility, which is fraught with catastrophic consequences”, according to the Kremlin, as reported by AFP. The largest nuclear power plant in Europe has been a focal point of fighting in recent weeks, raising concerns of a potential nuclear incident. Ukraine’s nuclear energy operator said on Sunday the final reactor at Zaporizhzhia had been shut off as a safety measure. During the call with Macron, Putin also accused Ukrainian forces of using western-supplied weapons to target civilian infrastructure in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine. More on the discussion (see 15:22) between the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Macron told Putin that its occupation by Russian troops was the root cause of danger at the site. The Élysée Palace said in a statement that Macron asked Putin to withdraw heavy and light weapons, and that Moscow should abide by the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure security. “The president will remain in contact with President [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy as well as the director general of the IAEA and will speak again in the coming days with President Putin so that an accord to guarantee security at the power plant can be found,” the statement said. Macron also asked Putin to ensure that a UN-brokered deal on grains was implemented to ensure they went to the most in need. He also repeated that the Russian invasion should stop immediately. Moscow’s leadership has remained “silent” on the defeats in Ukraine, with neither Vladmir Putin or the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, making any comment as of midday on Sunday. As Russian forces abandoned town after town on Saturday, Putin was opening Europe’s largest ferris wheel in a Moscow park, while fireworks lit up the sky over Red Square to celebrate the city’s founding in 1147. Moscow’s almost total silence on the defeat – or any explanation for what has taken place in north-eastern Ukraine – has provoked significant anger among some pro-war commentators and Russian nationalists on social media. However, according to a Kremlin transcript of Putin’s message there was no mention of the war. The Russian president told Muscovites: “We take pride in Moscow, and love this city with its majestic antiquity and its modern and dynamic pace of life, the charm of its cosy parks, lanes and streets and abundance of business and cultural events.” Putin, who has described his shock on being told as a KGB spy in East Germany that “Moscow is silent” as the Berlin Wall crumbled, said those who had fallen in the Ukraine operation had given their lives for Russia. The defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-appointed leader of Chechnya, has criticised the Russian army’s leadership after it appeared to be caught off-guard by Ukraine’s fightback against the Russian invasion in the north-east. In a sign that the Kremlin may face serious fallout over the loss of territory that the Russian occupation administrations had repeatedly stated they planned to keep “for ever”, Kadyrov also suggested that Vladimir Putin might not be aware of the real state of affairs. “They have made mistakes and I think they will draw the necessary conclusions,” Kadyrov said in an audio message posted to his Telegram channel on Sunday. “If today or tomorrow no changes in strategy are made, I will be forced to speak with the leadership of the defence ministry and the leadership of the country to explain the real situation on the ground to them. It’s a very interesting situation. It’s astounding, I would say,” said Kadyrov, a former rebel turned Kremlin ally who rules Chechnya – a Russian republic in the Caucuses – with an iron fist and has a paramilitary force at his command. Read more: Here is a round-up of all the day’s main news stories: Ukrainian forces have advanced north from Kharkiv to within 30 miles (48km) of the border with Russia and are also pressing to the south and east in the same region, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Gen Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said on Sunday. Ukrainian troops have retaken more than 3,000 sq km of territory this month, he wrote on the Telegram messaging app, adding: “Ukraine continues to liberate territories occupied by Russia. The Ukrainian advance into Russian-occupied territory in the north-east of the country continued on Sunday as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the next three months would be critical in determining the outcome of the war. In recent days, Ukrainian forces have retaken the key rail hub of Kupiansk and claim to have seized Izium, previously the major base for Russia in Kharkiv province. Zelenskiy has said Ukraine’s armed forces have retaken about 2,000 sq km (770 sq miles) of territory from Russian forces since their surprise north-eastern counteroffensive was launched earlier this month. In his Saturday night address, the Ukrainian president said: “These days, the Russian army is showing its best – showing its back. And, in the end, it is a good choice for them to run away. There is and will be no place for the occupiers in Ukraine.” The last operating reactor at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station has been shut down and the plant “completely stopped”, Ukraine’s nuclear power operator has said. The six-reactor Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from the grid last week after all its power lines were disconnected as a result of fighting in the area, and was operating in “island mode” for several days, generating electricity for crucial cooling systems from its only remaining reactor in operation. A backup power line to Zaporizhzhia has been restored, providing it with the external electricity it needs to cool its reactors, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Sunday. “After yesterday’s restoration of [the] power line ... #ZNPP operator this morning shut down its last operating reactor, which over past week had been providing ZNPP w/ required power after it was disconnected from grid,” the IAEA said on Twitter. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, discussed the security situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, the Kremlin said. Speaking by phone, the two leaders expressed readiness for a “non-politicised interaction” on the matter with the participation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), according to the statement published on the Kremlin’s website. France’s transport minister has said he will sign an agreement with Romania to increase Ukrainian grain exports to developing countries including to the Mediterranean. “Tomorrow, I will sign an accord with Romania that will allow Ukraine to get even more grains out ... towards Europe and developing countries, notably in the Mediterranean, which need it for food,” Clement Beaune told France Inter radio on Sunday, adding that the deal covered exports by land, sea and river. The UK government has said Ukrainian forces have continued to make significant gains in the Kharkiv region over the last 24 hours. Russia has probably withdrawn units from the area, but fighting continues around the cities of Kupiansk and Izium, the British defence ministry said in its daily intelligence bulletin on Twitter. Britain also dismissed Vladimir Putin’s assertion that only a fraction of grain exported from Ukraine under an international deal is going to poor countries. Putin said on Wednesday, without citing a source, that only two of 87 ships, carrying 60,000 tonnes of products, had gone to poor countries. The deal to allow grain exports from Ukrainian Black Sea ports, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, took effect last month. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Harry Taylor will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest news from Russia’s war on Ukraine. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, discussed the security situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, the Kremlin said. Speaking by phone, the two leaders expressed readiness for a “non-politicised interaction” on the matter with the participation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), according to the statement published on the Kremlin’s website. Reuters has some more detail on the news that France is to sign an agreement with Romania (see 13.03) to increase Ukrainian grain exports to developing countries, including in the Mediterranean. “Tomorrow, I will sign an accord with Romania that will allow Ukraine to get even more grains out ... towards Europe and developing countries, notably in the Mediterranean, which need it for food,” the French transport minister, Clément Beaune, told France Inter radio on Sunday, adding that the deal covered exports by land, sea and river. Reuters reports: According to a draft agreement of the French-Romanian deal, seen by Reuters, Paris would cooperate in developing a project aimed at increasing efficiency at the port of Galați, equipping border points in northern Romania. It would also help to build a medium-term strategy on the axes of the corridor between Romania and Ukraine, and provide pilings to optimise ship traffic. France will also provide funding for the initial technical expertise and work with Bucharest to identify financing for the future. Without citing a source, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on 7 September that only two of 87 ships, carrying 60,000 tonnes of exported grain products as part of an international deal brokered by the United Nations, had gone to poor countries. The accord to allow grain exports from Ukrainian Black Sea ports took effect in August. Beaune dismissed Putin’s assertion. Quoting UN figures, the British defence ministry also rejected the claim and said that about 30% of grain exported under the deal has been supplied to low- and middle-income countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Alisa, a 16-year-old art student from Kharkiv, arrived in Hungary in April with her family after fleeing their apartment in the suburb of Saltivka, which came under heavy shelling for weeks on end. After two days in a Budapest hotel, the family found an elderly Hungarian couple living in the countryside nearby who agreed to host Alisa, her brother and parents. The couple said their Ukrainian guests could stay as long as they needed. But recently, as the Hungarian government announced massive increases in energy bills for households that use above the national average, the couple made an embarrassed request. “Back then, they said we could stay until the end of the war, but now they’ve realised they can’t afford the energy bills. They very politely told us we had to leave,” said Alisa, who spent the summer working long shifts in a Hungarian factory, even though she is still a minor. “It took me two buses and four hours to get there, and the same to get back every day. The work was tiring, taking apart old electronics for hours on end. But at least I got some money which I could help my family with,” she said. In the six months since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the countries that border Ukraine, as well as others all across Europe, have launched an unprecedented effort to help millions of Ukrainian refugees. Governments have funded emergency support programmes, and millions of ordinary citizens have volunteered to provide food, clothing and shelter. But as an uncertain and potentially costly winter approaches, governments are rolling back support programmes for Ukrainians, while many volunteers who were happy to host a Ukrainian family for a few weeks or months are now realising that the war could go on for years. More and more Ukrainian refugees are finding themselves struggling to make ends meet. The Ukrainian advance into Russian-occupied territory in the north-east of the country continued on Sunday as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the next three months would be critical in determining the outcome of the war. In recent days, Ukrainian forces have retaken the key rail hub of Kupiansk and claim to have seized Izium, previously the major base for Russia in Kharkiv province. “The Russian army in these days is demonstrating the best that it can do – showing its back,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address on Saturday. Gen Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukrainian forces, said on Sunday that Ukraine had regained control of about 3,000 sq km of territory since the beginning of September. On Saturday night, Zelenskiy gave the figure as 2,000 sq km. The Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine has retaken more territory in five days than Russia had taken since April. Videos from recently recaptured territory illustrate the scale of the rout, showing military hardware and ammunition left behind by fleeing Russians at their former positions. Ukrainian politicians shared morale-boosting videos of the country’s soldiers raising the national flag in various towns and villages. The counteroffensive in the north-east of the country came as a surprise to Moscow and most military observers, who had been expecting instead the long-promised Ukrainian advance in the southern Kherson region. France’s transport minister has said he will sign an agreement with Romania to increase Ukrainian grain exports to developing countries including to the Mediterranean. “Tomorrow, I will sign an accord with Romania that will allow Ukraine to get even more grains out ... towards Europe and developing countries, notably in the Mediterranean, which need it for food,” Clement Beaune told France Inter radio on Sunday, adding that the deal covered exports by land, sea and river. A backup power line to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) inside Ukraine has been restored, providing it with the external electricity it needs to cool its reactors, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Sunday. “After yesterday’s restoration of [the] power line ... #ZNPP operator this morning shut down its last operating reactor, which over past week had been providing ZNPP w/ required power after it was disconnected from grid,” the IAEA said on Twitter. “This power can now come from the grid instead.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine has recaptured 770 sq miles of territory so far this month in a series of offensives. “The movement of our soldiers in different directions of the front continues,” the Ukrainian president said in an address late on Saturday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine’s armed forces have retaken about 2,000 sq km (770 sq miles) of territory from Russian forces since their surprise north-eastern counteroffensive was launched earlier this month. In his Saturday night address, the Ukrainian president said: “These days, the Russian army is showing its best – showing its back. And, in the end, it is a good choice for them to run away. There is and will be no place for the occupiers in Ukraine.” Zelenskiy spoke after the Russian army was forced to pull back thousands of troops following a series of crucial battlefield defeats in the north-east, as the invasion ordered by Vladimir Putin entered its 200th day. Ukrainian forces confirmed the liberation of the crucial rail hub of Kupiansk and shortly after seized Izium, the major base for Moscow’s forces in the Kharkiv region, in what was perhaps Ukraine’s most significant success in pushing back the Russians since the beginning of the invasion. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said in Kyiv that Ukrainian forces had demonstrated they were capable of defeating the Russian army with the weapons given to them. “And so I reiterate: the more weapons we receive, the faster we will win, and the faster this war will end,” he said. Ukrainian troops had also liberated the villages of Vasylenkovo and Artemivka in the Kharkiv region, Zelenskiy said. The last operating reactor at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station has been shut down and the plant “completely stopped”, Ukraine’s nuclear power operator has said. The six-reactor Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from the grid last week after all its power lines were disconnected as a result of fighting in the area, and was operating in “island mode” for several days, generating electricity for crucial cooling systems from its only remaining reactor in operation. Energoatom, the state-run operator of all four of Ukraine’s nuclear power stations, said one of the power lines was restored on Saturday night, allowing plant operators to shut down the last reactor. “A decision was made to shut down power unit No 6 and transfer it to the safest state – cold shutdown,” the operator said. Electricity supply to the plant has been cut with increasing frequency over the past few weeks, including at least three times last week. Volunteers at a railway station in Lviv in western Ukraine are doing all they can to help refugees flee the violence of Putin’s invasion and reach safety. Lviv is less than 50 miles from the Polish border and thousands of people have been arriving daily from the rest of country. The Guardian spent the day with one volunteer named Sergyi Mykolaiv. Ukrainian forces have advanced north from Kharkiv to within 30 miles (48km) of the border with Russia and are also pressing to the south and east in the same region, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Gen Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said on Sunday. Ukrainian troops have retaken more than 3,000 sq km of territory this month, he wrote on the Telegram messaging app, adding: “Ukraine continues to liberate territories occupied by Russia.” Reuters was not immediately able to verify his account. In case you missed it, the much-publicised Ukrainian southern offensive was a disinformation campaign to distract Russia from the real one being prepared in the Kharkiv region, Ukraine’s special forces have said. Ukrainian forces are continuing to make unexpected, rapid advances in the north-east of the country, retaking more than a third of the occupied Kharkiv region in three days. Much of Ukraine’s territorial gains were confirmed by Russia’s defence ministry on Saturday. “[It] was a big special disinformation operation,” said Taras Berezovets, a former national security adviser turned press officer for the Bohun brigade of Ukraine’s special forces. “[Russia] thought it would be in the south and moved their equipment. Then, instead of the south, the offensive happened where they least expected, and this caused them to panic and flee.” On 29 August, Ukraine’s southern command announced that the long-anticipated offensive in the Kherson region had begun. But soldiers on the Kherson frontline said at the time that they saw no evidence of said offensive, or that the active battles taking place were a reaction to an attempted Russian offensive several days earlier. Over the past two weeks, Ukrainian forces in the south have taken several villages – no small feat given the reported strength of Russian positions. The Associated Press has a piece today about Ukraine’s success in reclaiming broad swathes of the south and east in a long-anticipated counter-offensive that has dealt a heavy blow to Russia. The counter-attack began in the final days of August and at first focused on the southern region of Kherson, which was swept by Russian forces in the opening days of the invasion, it reports. But, just as Moscow redirected attention and troops there, Ukraine launched another, highly effective offensive in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv. AP reported: Facing the prospect of a large group of its forces becoming surrounded, Moscow ordered a troop pullback from Kharkiv, in a dramatic change of the state of play that posed the biggest challenge to the Kremlin since it launched the invasion on February 24. Mykola Sunhurovskyi, a military expert with the Razumkov Centre, a Kyiv-based think tank, said: “The Ukrainian army has taken advantage of the relocation of the bulk of the Russian forces to the south and is trying to direct the course of the war, excelling in manoeuvre and showing great ingenuity.” Ukraine’s quick gains, he added, are “important both for seizing initiative and raising troops’ spirit”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commended the military in a video address late on Saturday, saying it has reclaimed more than 770 square miles (2,000 sq km) of territory so far this month. He also taunted Moscow over its withdrawal, saying the Russian army is “demonstrating the best it can do - showing its back” and “they made a good choice to run”. Both sides have suffered heavy losses in Europe’s largest conflict since the Second World War. Since the counter-offensive began, Ukraine said, its forces have reclaimed more than 30 settlements in the Kharkiv region. Britain has dismissed Vladimir Putin’s assertion that only a fraction of grain exported from Ukraine under an international deal is going to poor countries. Putin said on Wednesday, without citing a source, that only two of 87 ships, carrying 60,000 tonnes of products, had gone to poor countries. The deal to allow grain exports from Ukrainian Black Sea ports, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, took effect last month. Quoting UN figures, the British defence ministry said about 30% of grain exported under the deal has been supplied to low- and middle-income countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, Reuters reported. Russia is pursuing a deliberate misinformation strategy as it seeks to deflect blame for food insecurity issues, discredit Ukraine and minimise opposition to its invasion, the ministry said in its daily intelligence bulletin on Twitter. The UK government has said Ukrainian forces have continued to make significant gains in the Kharkiv region over the last 24 hours. Russia has probably withdrawn units from the area, but fighting continues around the cities of Kupiansk and Izium, the British defence ministry said in its daily intelligence bulletin on Twitter. Aside from the latest news at the Zaporizhzhia plant, here are the main developments: Ukraine’s counter-offensive in the north-east of the country has inflicted an extraordinary defeat on Moscow, prompting the Russian army to pull back thousands of troops after a series of battlefield defeats. Ukraine appears to have regained control of the two key cities of Kupiansk and Izium after a major counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region in recent days, after wrongfooting Russian forces with a much-publicised Ukrainian southern offensive to distract Russia from the real one being prepared in Kharkiv. Photos published by the Ukrainian security forces showed troops raising the national flag in Kupiansk, an important logistical hub for Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, where rail lines linking Russia to eastern Ukraine converge and which, in the last months, has supplied Russian forces in north-eastern Ukraine. The Russian defence ministry confirmed the withdrawal of its troops from Izium, the major base for Moscow’s forces in Kharkiv, claiming they were being “regrouped” so that efforts could be stepped up in Donetsk. Retaking Izium is perhaps Ukraine’s most significant success in pushing back the Russians since the beginning of the invasion. The Ukrainian flag has also been raised in the city of Balakliia, according to the Kharkiv regional governor. The UK Ministry of Defence said Russian forces were “likely taken by surprise” by the counteroffensive. The much-publicised Ukrainian southern offensive was a disinformation campaign to distract Russia from the real one being prepared in the Kharkiv region, Ukraine’s special forces said. “[Russia] thought it would be in the south and moved their equipment. Then, instead of the south, the offensive happened where they least expected, and this caused them to panic and flee,” said Taras Berezovets, a former national security adviser turned press officer for the Bohun brigade of Ukraine’s special forces. In a video address on Saturday, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukrainian forces had liberated about 2,000 sq km (700 square miles) of territory since the counteroffensive against Russia started earlier this month, saying: “The Russian army these days is demonstrating its best ability – to show its back.” Residents in Russian-controlled parts of the Kharkiv region have been advised to evacuate to Russia, according to the state-run news agency Tass. A woman has been killed and at least 20 civilians injured in Russian shelling in the Kharkiv district, according to the regional governor. A resident of Izium, who preferred to remain anonymous, confirmed to the Guardian that Ukrainian troops had entered the city. Before that, “Russian occupying forces were rapidly withdrawing, leaving ammunition and equipment behind.” The UN said it has documented “torture and ill-treatment” of prisoners of war held by Russian forces in Ukraine. It also said it had corroborated at least 5,767 civilian deaths, though added that the actual numbers are “likely considerably higher”. The Ukrainian military said a further 350 Russian soldiers had been killed, bringing the total number since the start of the invasion to 52,250. The military also said Russia was also sending 1,300 Chechen fighters to the southern Kherson region. It comes as western intelligence suggests that Russian forces in Kherson are coming under sustained pressure from Ukrainian attacks. Despite the gains made by Ukraine’s armed forces, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the war was entering a critical period and he urged Ukraine’s western backers to keep up their support through what could be a difficult winter. Today’s shutdown follows the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog chief saying on Friday that recent shelling made the “situation increasingly precarious” as reliable supply was unlikely to be restored. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said vital offsite electricity supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant had been destroyed by shelling and there was little likelihood a reliable supply would be re-established. He said shelling had destroyed the switchyard of a nearby thermal power plant. The plant has supplied power to the nuclear facility each time its normal supply lines had been cut over the past three weeks. The sixth reactor had been operating in “island mode” for the past three days, it said, feeding only its own needs after power lines were severed by Russian shelling. The restoration of one of these lines on Saturday enabled the operator to make the decision to place the site in “the safest state – cold shutdown”. If lines continue to be damaged, the plant will rely on backup diesel generators, “the duration of which is limited by the technological resource and the amount of available diesel fuel”, Energoatom said. In a statement posted on Telegram, Energoatom said the sixth and last functioning reactor was disconnected from the national grid at 3.41am and that “preparations are under way for its cooling and transfer to a cold state”. Operations at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine have fully halted, Energoatom, the state agency in charge of the plant, said on Sunday. The agency said the restoration of power to the plant had allowed it to do the safest thing and power down its sixth and last working reactor. Kyiv on Wednesday called for residents of Russian-occupied areas around the plant, Europe’s largest, to evacuate for their own safety. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling the nuclear plant, risking a nuclear disaster."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/oct/11/power-giants-to-face-windfall-tax-after-all-as-liz-truss-delivers-u-turn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-11T21:30:14Z","webTitle":"Power giants to face ‘windfall tax’ after all as Liz Truss delivers U-turn ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/11/power-giants-to-face-windfall-tax-after-all-as-liz-truss-delivers-u-turn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/oct/11/power-giants-to-face-windfall-tax-after-all-as-liz-truss-delivers-u-turn","fields":{"headline":"Power giants to face ‘windfall tax’ after all as Liz Truss delivers U-turn ","bodyText":"Renewable power companies will have their revenues capped in England and Wales, after the government bowed to pressure to clamp down on runaway profits. The announcement late on Tuesday night provoked immediate accusations that Downing Street had performed “another screeching U-turn” – having previously rejected calls to impose a windfall tax on power giants. On the leadership trail, Liz Truss repeatedly resisted calls to cap huge profits being generated by power companies, after Boris Johnson’s government imposed a £5bn windfall tax on oil and gas companies in May, taking a slice of their profits. The business department said it was stepping in with a temporary “cost-plus revenue limit” for renewable and nuclear electricity generators in England and Wales. This will curb the amount generators can make, “allowing generators to cover their costs, plus receive an appropriate revenue”, and will come into force at the start of next year. The detail was contained in the government’s new energy prices bill, which limits power prices for households at an average of £2,500 a year and is estimated will cost taxpayers about £89bn. It has been estimated that taxing generators such as wind and solar farms could raise between £3bn and £4bn to help offset some of this cost. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate and net zero secretary, said: “The government has finally accepted the principle of Labour’s call for a windfall tax on excess profits of electricity generators. “After months of telling the country they were utterly opposed to the principle of a windfall tax, they have been dragged kicking and screaming to implement it. “Yet again this shows Labour leading the agenda in British politics with another screeching U-turn from a government in office but not in power. But the government’s delay in acting will have cost billions and the public will pay the price.” Truss ruled out a windfall tax on power generators when vying with Rishi Sunak to become prime minister, calling it “a Labour idea and all about bashing business and it sends the wrong message to international investors and to the public”. She reinforced her stance when announcing her household bills package last month, saying: “I believe it is the wrong thing to be putting companies off investing in the UK.” But after reversing plans to scrap the top rate of tax last week, Truss’s decision to limit profits at renewable power companies will be seen as another sign of weakness. The government has been accused by institutions including the IMF of making the Bank of England’s cutting-inflation job harder. Mortgage rates soared, along with government borrowing costs, after chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s disastrous mini-budget last month. An industry source said: “This is another U-turn as it’s 100% a windfall tax from the people that said they would never do one.” The business department argues that the measure differs from a windfall tax as it will be applied to excess revenues generators are receiving, rather than applying to all profits. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said renewable power generators have been benefiting from “abnormally high prices” because of the link between soaring gas prices and wholesale electricity prices, since Russia’s winvasion of Ukraine. “Low-carbon electricity generators are therefore benefiting from abnormally high prices, while consumers are having to pay significantly more for energy generated from renewables and nuclear, even though they often cost less to produce,” it said. The government said the limit would be a “temporary measure to deal with the exceptional market conditions driven by high global gas prices”. The decision to impose a cap on revenues earned by renewable power companies such as wind and solar farm operators follows months of painful wrangling between the government and industry. Ministers tried to encourage companies to voluntarily move on to contracts for difference (CfDs), that cap profits above a certain level, but without much success. BEIS said the revenue cap would remain in place until the markets returned to normal or generators moved on to other market arrangements, such as CfDs. “It will ensure consumers pay a fair price for low-carbon energy and has the potential to save billions of pounds for British bill payers, while allowing generators to cover their costs, plus receive an appropriate revenue,” BEIS said. Nevertheless, generators reacted with dismay. Keith Anderson, chief executive of ScottishPower, said: “We’re deeply worried at the suggestion renewables generators are making extraordinary profits when our power has been sold in advance at much lower pre-war prices – a fraction of today’s cost – protecting customers by hundreds of millions of pounds. “It’s disappointing that such a significant market intervention by the government has come with so little detail, all this does is create uncertainty. This crisis has been caused by the cost of gas and it’s strange the proposed solution is to cap the price of low-carbon generation and to leave the gas sector untouched.” A spokesperson for SSE said: “Any revenue cap must be set at a level that doesn’t discourage essential investment in the UK’s renewable energy sector and therefore should be comparable to other countries, particularly given the €180 [per megawatt hour] cap being implemented by the EU. After all, the key lesson of the current energy crisis is the need to bolster our homegrown energy defences. “It is also vital that the cap does not negatively impact on security of supply this winter, therefore flexible technologies, such as hydro, that require strong price signals to meet demand when most needed should be excluded.” The announcement was light on details, but the government said it had been working closely with industry on the proposal, and would launch a consultation shortly. BEIS is liaising with the Scottish government to confirm whether the measure will extend to Scotland. The legislation also allows for a temporary revenue limit to apply in Northern Ireland. In determining the limit, BEIS said it was taking into account the pre-crisis expectations for wholesale prices, and what a reasonable upper estimate for those might be. It intends to allow generators to keep a proportion of their revenue above the limit. Britain has a diverse energy generation sector, including companies supplying power from gas- and coal-fired power plants, windfarms and nuclear power stations. Centrica, ScottishPower and some others serve consumers directly, but many are focused on delivering power to retail suppliers. The biggest generators include SSE, E.ON, Ørsted and Drax, which runs a large eponymous power plant in North Yorkshire. Nevertheless, the announcement implied Drax and nuclear power plants and other so-called baseload power providers would be given special treatment under the scheme, given “the importance of continued investment in these supplies”. In May, the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced what he called a “temporary, targeted energy profits levy” of 25% on oil and gas firms, but with a 90% tax relief for companies that invest in oil and gas extraction in the UK. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the business and energy secretary, said: “We have been working with low-carbon generators to find a solution that will ensure consumers are not paying significantly more for electricity generated from renewables and nuclear.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/apr/02/mikhail-shishkin-my-russia-war-or-peace-interview-letter","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-02T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"Mikhail Shishkin: ‘The main enemy of Russian culture is the Russian regime’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/02/mikhail-shishkin-my-russia-war-or-peace-interview-letter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/apr/02/mikhail-shishkin-my-russia-war-or-peace-interview-letter","fields":{"headline":"Mikhail Shishkin: ‘The main enemy of Russian culture is the Russian regime’","bodyText":"Mikhail Shishkin was born in Moscow and is one of the most lauded writers in contemporary Russian literature, and the only one to receive all three of Russia’s most prestigious literary awards. An outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin and what he calls his “criminal regime”, he has lived in exile in Switzerland since 1995. In My Russia: War Or Peace?, his most recent book to be translated into English, he surveys the violent contours of Russia history and examines the troubled relationship between the Russian state and its citizens. You’ve spoken in the past of a civil war in Russian literature between nationalists and liberals. Has that deepened since the invasion of Ukraine? Twenty years ago we were all together in Kyiv at the literary festival – writers and poets writing in Russian in Ukraine. And I had the feeling that finally we are building the future Russian culture, where mutual understanding is important. And then later the Crimea annexation came and I saw people I’d been sitting at the table with shouting: “Crimea is ours! Crimea is ours!” It was like the famous play by [Eugène] Ionesco, Rhinoceros, where people turn into rhinoceroses. It wasn’t possible to talk to them. It was impossible to talk to my brother who lives in Moscow. So we became strangers. There is something like a civilisation gap between us in Russian culture. I can understand why people who don’t read books support this war. But it’s impossible for me to explain why cultured people support this war. In your book you say it’s the mission of all Russian writers and artists to show that not all Russians support this war. But as you say, many artists and writers don’t think that’s their mission. It’s a mission for me now. All my life I felt very solid ground under my feet. It was Russian culture. And now it’s blown away. One hundred years ago Russian immigrants were not ashamed of speaking Russian on the streets of Berlin or Paris. But now they are ashamed to speak their language. And my mission now is to do everything to return dignity to the Russian language. And that is possible only with the victory of Ukraine in this war against our common enemy, the Russian regime, because the main enemy of Russian culture is the Russian regime. You write that Russia will have a future only if it passes through total defeat. Is that a viable option for a nuclear power? Putin has the psychology of all dictators: “If I leave this world, the world must go with me.” They don’t have empathy. They don’t love people. They hate people. And so I’m sure he would press the red button. But nobody will fulfil his order to destroy the Earth. Nobody. And you know why? Because in Russia the main question is not like in Russian classical literature of 19th century: who is to blame? What is to be done? No, the main question is: is the tsar real or false? And you can prove that you are real by winning a war. Stalin killed millions of people but he is beloved by the population. Gorbachev was beloved in the west, but he lost the Afghanistan war and the cold war against the west. [So] he’s despised. Putin’s generals told him they would take Kyiv in three days, and he miscalculated. He failed. And now he is a false tsar. Nobody will fulfil an order from a false tsar. Your book is a warning against the corruption of language, the normalisation of the lie. But if a lie carries more power than the truth, who will be brave enough to challenge it, and risk imprisonment or death? When was the last time, for example, you were in Russia? Last time I was in Russia was in October 2014. At the Krasnoyarsk book fair. I was the only one who was talking from the stage about the war. This silence was so humiliating, it was my last visit to Russia. Now it’s impossible to go anyway. I get death threats, but what should I do? Should I keep silent? Should I stop talking or writing? Then my life doesn’t make any sense any more. I will not give up. You write about the “wild 90s” in Russia when oligarchs stole natural resources and criminals were empowered. It was the great missed opportunity. What could the west have done to support Russian democracy? I’m afraid the truth is that the west helped to introduce this criminal regime to Russian people. In the 90s people were ready for democracy but they had no idea how it works. What did western democracies show to the new Russian democracy? I worked as an interpreter in Switzerland and I saw how this huge laundry machine works. People with the stolen money, the dirty money came from Russia to open an account in Zurich. And lawyers, people from the banks, everybody was so happy to get this dirty money. They were absolutely aware that this was dirty money. The same thing happened in London, even worse I think. It’s of course the main responsibility of the Russians but without this support from western democracies, it would have been impossible to create this new dictatorship in Russia. Do you view the future of Russia with any sense of optimism? I am very optimistic for Ukraine. I’m sure they will have victory in this war. And I’m very pessimistic for the Russian future. I don’t think it will be a democratic, wonderful, beautiful country. One day Putin will not be here, and then we will see a huge fight for power. The collapse of the Russian empire will continue; all these national republics will leave the Russian Federation. Siberia will go. I think we will have new dictators and the west will support them because they will promise to take control of nuclear weapons, and Russian history will bite its tail again. You say in the book that hate is the disease, and culture is the cure. Can culture have a role in changing that bleak future? After this war, there will be such huge hate between Ukrainians and Russians. It will be not easy to make bridges. But we’ll have to make bridges. And these bridges can be built only by culture, only by civilisation, only by literature and music. That will be the huge mission.

It did not specify the locations. The claim follows widely reported explosions at Russia’s Saki air base. Crimea’s regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov, said some 250 residents were moved to temporary housing after dozens of apartment buildings were damaged, but Russian authorities have generally sought to downplay the explosions. Unverified social media footage purports to show damage to planes on the ground at the airport. Crimea’s regional ministry of health has said that one person died and 13 people were injured as a result of explosions at the air base near Novofedorivka. The Russian military have said that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area at the facility. Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014. In his nightly address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not discuss who was behind the attacks but vowed to “liberate” Crimea, saying: “This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea – with its liberation.” An adviser to the president, Mikhail Podolyak, said Ukraine was not taking responsibility for the explosions, suggesting partisans might have been involved. Russian forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are reorienting the plant’s electricity production to connect to Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, according to Ukrainian operator Energoatom. “To do this, you must first damage the power lines of the plant connected to the Ukrainian energy system. From August 7 to 9, the Russians have already damaged three power lines. At the moment, the plant is operating with only one production line, which is an extremely dangerous way of working,” Energoatom president Petro Kotin told Ukrainian television. The plant, located not far from the Crimean peninsula, has six of Ukraine’s 15 reactors, and is capable of supplying power for four million homes. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power firm warned of the “very high” risks from shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the Russian-occupied south and said it was vital Kyiv regains control over the facility in time for winter. Energoatom’s chief, Petro Kotin, told Reuters in an interview that last week’s Russian shelling had damaged three lines that connect the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Ukrainian grid and that Russia wanted to connect the facility to its grid. Russia’s daily military briefing for Wednesday has claimed to have shot down three Ukrainian planes overnight, and to have destroyed German-supplied anti-aircraft systems. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has said that in the last 24 hours two people have been killed and 25 civilians were injured in the territory it claims to control. At least 13 people have been killed overnight by shelling in Marhanets in Dnipropetrovsk. Regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said more than 20 buildings were damaged. Ukraine’s emergency service has distributed images which appear to show a school in Marhanets damaged by an attack. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, said that as a result of shelling at around 1.40am Wednesday morning, three people, including a 13 year-old girl, were injured in the city of Mykolaiv. He said residential buildings were damaged as a result of shelling. The leaders of Estonia and Finland want fellow European countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens, saying they should not be able to take holidays in Europe while the Russian government carries out a war in Ukraine. The Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, wrote on Tuesday on Twitter that “visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right” and that it was “time to end tourism from Russia now”, the Associated Press reported. Denmark will send military instructors to Britain to train Ukrainian soldiers and also aims to train Ukrainian officers in Denmark, the Danish defence minister said in an interview with the Jyllands-Posten newspaper published Wednesday. The US state department has approved $89m worth of assistance to help Ukraine equip and train 100 teams to clear landmines and unexploded ordnance for a year, Reuters reported. US president Joe Biden on Tuesday signed documents endorsing Finland and Sweden’s accession to Nato, the most significant expansion of the military alliance since the 1990s as it responds to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. The total number of grain-carrying ships to leave Ukrainian ports under a UN brokered deal to ease the global food crisis has now reached 12, with the two latest ships which left on Tuesday headed for Istanbul and Turkey. Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad has been struggling with quotas imposed by the EU for sanctioned goods that it can import across Lithuania from mainland Russia or Belarus, the region’s governor admitted. Lithuania infuriated Moscow in June by banning the land transit of goods such as concrete and steel to Kaliningrad after EU sanctions on them came into force, Reuters reported. Russia has launched an Iranian satellite from Kazakhstan amid concerns it could be used for battlefield surveillance in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Iran has denied that the Khayyam satellite, which was delivered into orbit onboard a Soyuz rocket launched from Baikonur cosmodrome, would ever be under Russian control. But the Washington Post previously reported that Moscow told Tehran it “plans to use the satellite for several months, or longer, to enhance its surveillance of military targets” in Ukraine, according to two US officials."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/dec/14/tech-coalition-aiming-to-create-australian-high-powered-laser-industry-with-nuclear-fusion-ambitions","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T14:00:25Z","webTitle":"Tech coalition aiming to create Australian high-powered laser industry with nuclear fusion ambitions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/14/tech-coalition-aiming-to-create-australian-high-powered-laser-industry-with-nuclear-fusion-ambitions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/dec/14/tech-coalition-aiming-to-create-australian-high-powered-laser-industry-with-nuclear-fusion-ambitions","fields":{"headline":"Tech coalition aiming to create Australian high-powered laser industry with nuclear fusion ambitions","bodyText":"A coalition of technology companies intend to create a high-intensity laser industry in Australia, with potential applications including nuclear fusion. It follows reports of an expected announcement from the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California that researchers have managed to get more energy out of a nuclear fusion reaction than they put in. The coalition, led by the Australian laser fusion company HB11 Energy, also includes the University of Adelaide, the Institute of Laser Engineering at Osaka University, the Japanese laser fusion firm EX-Fusion, and the French engineering multinational Thales Group. It aims to develop an ultra-high intensity laser facility in Australia, with petawatt (one quadrillion, or one million billion watts) lasers. Dr Warren McKenzie, founder and managing director of HB11 Energy, said Australia was one of few developed countries without such a facility, adding that high-powered lasers could be used for energy generation through nuclear fusion. “The same lasers can be used, for instance, for the transmutation of fission radioactive waste – essentially reducing the half-life of radioactive waste from hundreds or thousands of years to tens of years,” he said. McKenzie also described the reported US fusion result as arguably “one of the biggest developments in energy science this century”. National Ignition Facility researchers have reportedly produced more energy from a nuclear fusion reaction than what was put in – a milestone known as net energy gain. In a development yet to be confirmed by the NIF, scientists are reported to have shot high-power lasers at a fuel pellet of deuterium and tritium – both isotopes of hydrogen – inside a metal capsule. “Lasers both heat the fuel … but they also compress it to much higher than its natural density, and the combination of the increase in density from the compression and the heat is what triggers fusion,” McKenzie said. Prof Ken Baldwin of the Australian National University described the NIF’s apparent advancement as “a truly groundbreaking achievement”, but said it was unlikely fusion power would “save us from climate change”. “All the heavy lifting for the energy transition will be done by renewable energy and nuclear fission (existing nuclear power) – with nuclear fusion at commercial scale unlikely to be available until later this century, well after the 2050 deadline needed to keep global warming below two degrees. But beyond that, fusion might provide limitless energy for centuries to come,” Baldwin said in a statement. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Mark Diesendorf, an associate professor and deputy director of the Institute of Environmental Studies at the University of New South Wales, agreed that fusion was “decades away from any possibility of commercial electricity generation”. “There’s a huge gap between this experiment – which I really would hesitate to call a breakthrough – and what has to be done to get commercial electricity out,” he said. “There’s an intense pulse of laser radiation for a tiny fraction of a second. Then the question is: during that tiny fraction of second, did they get more fusion energy out than they put in?” Diesendorf said. “To generate electricity, what you’ve got to do is to have thousands and thousands … perhaps millions of these pulses a day successfully getting more energy out. And then you’ve got to capture that energy.” Diesendorf also warned of the risk of nuclear proliferation, pointing out that the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the fusion breakthrough was made, is a nuclear weapons research facility. “Fusion produces neutrons and neutrons can be used to transmute elements – so you can get nuclear explosives such as plutonium-239 and uranium-233 and uranium-235,” Diesendorf said. “You can also produce lots of tritium … an essential component of nuclear bombs in missiles.” McKenzie said HB11 was the first modern private fusion company to demonstrate fusion involving lasers, and that unlike the NIF, it was not using tritium as fuel, but boron. “When we produce fusion, it doesn’t create any radiation or radioactive waste,” he said. HB11 is still “four orders of magnitude” away from achieving net energy gain. McKenzie said the firm was able to generate 0.01% of the energy input in its fusion reactions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/12/ukraine-russia-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-201-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-12T13:10:16Z","webTitle":"Ukraine-Russia war latest: what we know on day 201 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/12/ukraine-russia-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-201-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/12/ukraine-russia-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-201-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine-Russia war latest: what we know on day 201 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukrainian forces have recaptured about 500 sq km of territory in the south of the country over the past two weeks, Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command, said on Monday. This includes five settlements in the Kherson region, Humeniuk said. The Kremlin responded Monday to Ukraine’s weekend advances by doubling down and saying that Russia will achieve the goals of its “special military operation”. In this same call, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said that there were no discussions taking place about the possible demilitarisation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, despite it being one of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s key recommendations from its visit to the plant. Russian missile strikes on Monday have once again knocked out power and halted the water supply in Kharkiv, said Ihor Terekhov, the mayor of Kharkiv city, on Telegram. The shelling targeting the region’s infrastructure came after rescue workers had restored about 80% of the power and water to the region following more targeted attacks the day before. Both Terekhov and Volodymyr Zelenskiy have decried these attacks on infrastructure as “Russian terrorists”. “No military facilities [were attacked],” the Ukrainian president said in a statement on social media. “The goal is to deprive people of light and heat.” At least 1,000 people have been killed in the last six months fighting in Izium, a city in north-eastern Ukraine. Izium is one of the more than 20 towns and villages that Ukraine’s general staff said its forces had recaptured in the past days, as part of a counteroffensive that has forced Russian forces to abandon their positions and leave behind huge stocks of ammunition and equipment. Now with the city back in Ukrainian hands, officials are able to assess its losses and warned that the real figure of people killed since Russian forces took the city as a main stronghold is probably much higher. Russian forces launched 11 missiles against eastern Ukraine overnight, the Ukrainian air force announced in a tweet on Sunday night, causing a total blackout in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, and partial blackouts in the Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy regions. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s president, said Kharkiv’s CHPP-5 electricity station – one of the largest in Ukraine – had been hit. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, said later that power had been restored in some regions. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, denounced Russia’s strikes on the power and water facilities. “Russia’s apparent response to Ukraine liberating cities and villages in the east: sending missiles to attempt to destroy critical civilian infrastructure,” Brink tweeted. The general commanding Russia’s western army group has been sacked after the retreat in the Kharkiv region, according to Ukrainian military intelligence. It reported on its Telegram channel that Gen Roman Berdnikov has been replaced after only 17 days in his post, the GUR said. The success of Ukrainian forces in pushing Russian troops out of the Kharkiv region “have significant implications for Russia’s overall operational design”, according to the UK Ministry of Defence, and for the morale of its soldiers on the ground. “The majority of the force in Ukraine is highly likely being forced to prioritise emergency defensive actions. The already limited trust deployed troops have in Russia’s senior military leadership is likely to deteriorate further.” Kirill Stremousov, one of the leaders of the Russian-imposed authorities in occupied Kherson in southern Ukraine, has questioned the situation to the north, saying that “Kherson is and will be a Russian city. No one is going to surrender the city, let alone retreat. Regarding the situation in the Kharkiv region, many of us are at a loss about the current situation.” Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish long-term ally of Russia’s president, and currently deputy chairman of the security council of Russia, has threatened Ukraine again, saying: “Zelenskiy said that he would not engage in dialogue with those who put forward ultimatums. The current ‘ultimatums’ are a child’s warm-up for the demands of the future. And he knows them: the total capitulation of the Kyiv regime on Russia’s terms.” Western governments are mobilising their arms manufacturers to ramp up production and replenish stockpiles heavily diminished by supplying Ukraine’s six-month-old battle against Russia’s invasion. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, is organising a meeting of senior national armaments directors from allied countries to make long-term plans for supplying Ukraine and rebuilding their own arms reserves. The acting United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Nada al-Nashif, said on Monday morning that Russia was intimidating opponents of the war in Ukraine. “In the Russian Federation, the intimidation, restrictive measures and sanctions against people voicing opposition to the war in Ukraine undermine the exercise of constitutionally guaranteed fundamental freedoms, including the rights to free assembly, expression and association.” Joe Biden’s new ambassador in Berlin has urged Olaf Scholz’s government to “take more of a leadership role”, as calls grow for Germany to support Ukraine’s advances in the north-east by delivering tanks. After praising Germany’s military and financial support for Kyiv, the US ambassador, Amy Guttmann, told broadcaster ZDF “my expectations for Germany are higher”. Ukraine on Sunday shut down the last operating reactor at Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant to guard against a catastrophe as fighting rages nearby. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling around the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia plant, risking a release of radiation. The International Atomic Energy Agency said a backup power line to the plant had been restored, providing the external electricity it needed to carry out the shutdown while defending against the risk of a meltdown. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, told Putin in a phone call on Sunday the plant’s occupation by Russian troops is the reason why its security is compromised, the French presidency said. Putin blamed Ukrainian forces, according to a Kremlin statement. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-appointed leader of Chechnya, has criticised the Russian army’s leadership after it appeared to be caught off-guard by Ukraine’s fightback against the Russian invasion in the north-east. In a sign that the Kremlin may face serious fallout over the loss of territory that the Russian occupation administrations had repeatedly stated they planned to keep “forever”, Kadyrov also suggested that Vladimir Putin might not be aware of the real state of affairs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/12/national-grid-coal-fired-plants-uk-icy-weather-electricity-blackouts-snow","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-12T11:44:12Z","webTitle":"National Grid stands down coal plants on standby in icy weather","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/12/national-grid-coal-fired-plants-uk-icy-weather-electricity-blackouts-snow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/12/national-grid-coal-fired-plants-uk-icy-weather-electricity-blackouts-snow","fields":{"headline":"National Grid stands down coal plants on standby in icy weather","bodyText":"Great Britain’s electricity system operator has stood down two coal-fired power stations that were put on emergency standby to keep the lights on amid a spell of cold weather. Earlier on Monday, National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) said the two “winter contingency coal units” would be available if required as temperatures dip below zero and demand soars. It said the public should continue to use energy as normal. But the units will not now be needed, with Great Britain’s energy needs met by other sources, including an anticipated pickup in wind power. The government this summer asked the owners of coal-fired power stations to slow closure plans as ministers looked to shore up energy supplies after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia was previously a big supplier of natural gas to Europe, so the invasion roiled global energy markets and prompted a scramble for alternatives. The coal plants in North Yorkshire that were preparing to operate on Monday are owned by the energy company Drax. They would only operate if instructed to do so by National Grid, and Drax would not have been able to sell the electricity on the open market. A Drax spokesperson said: “National Grid ESO instructed the units to be warmed earlier today so that they were ready to generate power should the country require it. That instruction has since been stood down.” It comes as snowfall and ice caused travel disruption and forced school closures across the UK. The drop in temperatures prompted UK power prices to hit a record high on Sunday. Great Britain’s electricity generation system has rapidly moved away from coal in recent years: its first coal-free day was achieved in 2017, while in 2020 the island ran without coal-powered electricity for a month during a sunny May. The use of zero-carbon renewables has increased rapidly to replace it, but the UK has also increased its reliance on natural gas, a fossil fuel. That reliance has proved problematic during 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine. Great Britain was heavily dependent on burning gas for electricity generation over the weekend, with low winds and cloudy skies. On Saturday, gas generated 62% of electricity in Great Britain, according to National Grid data. Nuclear power stations generated 14%, while wind and solar accounted for 8% and 1% respectively. Coal accounted for 4%. (Northern Ireland’s energy system operates separately.) National Grid ESO sought to emphasise that asking the coal-fired power stations to heat up did not mean it had any concern over blackouts on Monday. “This measure should give the public confidence in Monday’s energy supply,” National Grid ESO said. “The ESO as a prudent system operator has these tools for additional contingency to operate the network as normal and the public should continue to use energy as normal.” EDF, the French energy giant, said the nuclear fleet in the UK was running at full available capacity for the first time this winter after the return of Hartlepool Unit 1 from a planned refuelling outage. EDF operates the fleet, in which the British Gas owner, Centrica, is a minority investor. National Grid warned in October that severe conditions could trigger planned power cuts this winter. Fintan Slye, the executive director of the ESO, said that was still a possibility. But he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We remain cautiously optimistic through the winter that we will be able to manage it. We have enough supplies secured through the rest of the day that we can manage that and ensure there’s no disruption to customers’ supplies.” National Grid will run a test of its “demand flexibility scheme”, which encourages households to reduce their energy use during peak times, on Monday evening. Octopus Energy said its customers had been paid £1m for reducing their energy usage during the company’s first four “saving sessions” as part of the scheme. Customers saved on average more than £4 across the four sessions, with the top 5% of savers bringing in almost £20."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/09/walk-away-traditional-owners-defend-kakadu-against-a-new-push-from-uranium-miners","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-08T19:00:37Z","webTitle":"‘Walk away’: traditional owners defend Kakadu against a new push from uranium miners ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/09/walk-away-traditional-owners-defend-kakadu-against-a-new-push-from-uranium-miners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/09/walk-away-traditional-owners-defend-kakadu-against-a-new-push-from-uranium-miners","fields":{"headline":"‘Walk away’: traditional owners defend Kakadu against a new push from uranium miners ","bodyText":"The battle to protect Kakadu national park from uranium mining has reignited with a push to overturn an 18-year-old promise to First Nations people in order to access billions of dollars of radioactive ore. It is the resurrection of a decades-old campaign to mine Jabiluka, a proposal that was abandoned after a hard-fought campaign by the Mirarr people – traditional owners – and environmentalists. But the debate is also throwing the rehabilitation of Ranger, an open-cut uranium mine adjacent to Jabiluka imposed on the Mirarr in the 1970s, into doubt. Rio Tinto owns 86% of the mine operator, Energy Resources of Australia, and has agreed to spend the billions needed to restore the land at Ranger to the same quality as the surrounding park. Rio has also pledged not to mine Jabiluka as long as the traditional owners are against it. The Mirarr say they will never change their minds. They want to put mining in the past and instead build an economy out of the township of Jabiru that is based on tourism to Kakadu. The world heritage site on Australia’s northern tip is not only brimming with natural beauty, it also carries immense cultural and spiritual significance as the site of the oldest known site of human habitation in Australia. With the deposits at Ranger tapped out and just two years to go on the mining lease at Jabiluka, the fate of the mines seemed sealed. But minority shareholders in ERA reckon Jabiluka’s rich deposit should be mined to provide fuel for the transition to a low-carbon economy and that it’s also worth having another look at a second deposit deep underneath the Ranger site. Their cause was given a boost last week with the release of a valuation report, commissioned by members of the ERA board who aren’t affiliated with Rio, that suggested Jabiluka is worth more than $1bn. It provoked a furious response from the Mirarr, who have called for the Albanese government to intervene; and from Rio, which called on ERA’s chair to resign. The furore has thrown into doubt ERA’s ability to raise the $2.2bn needed to fulfil its promise to restore Ranger. This week, all the independent directors of ERA resigned. Rio agreed to give the company some breathing space by lending it up to $100m towards rehabilitation of Ranger. However, the fundamental dispute has yet to be resolved. ‘The white man is not likely to stop’ Right from the beginning, the Mirarr people opposed mining for uranium on their land. Their opposition was noted as early in 1977 when the final report of the Fox inquiry set up by the Whitlam government found that traditional owners opposed mining but “felt that having got so far, the white man is not likely to stop”. The head of the inquiry, Russell Fox, said that the wishes of the Indigenous people should be considered but continued: “In the end, we form the conclusion that their opposition should not be allowed to prevail.” The mine was approved by the Fraser government to open in 1980. That was it until 1998, when the ERA, then owned by North Ltd, began a campaign to start a new mine at Jabiluka. That was opposed by an alliance of the Mirarr, led by Yvonne Margarula, and green groups, who held a nine-month blockade of the mine site. About 5,000 people took part and more than 500 were arrested. “It was high stakes,” says Dave Sweeney, a nuclear campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation who was involved with the blockade. “The mining company was intent on developing this, it had the full support of the Northern Territory government – then the CLP, the Country Liberal party. They had the full support of the federal government. What Sweeney calls a “green-black” alliance also held protests outside the Sydney offices of ERA and North Ltd in Melbourne. “Both of those corporate headquarters were the focus of pretty sustained and sometimes pretty rowdy protests,” Sweeney says. North was taken over by Rio Tinto in 2000. Rio wanted North’s lucrative iron ore assets. It attempted to sell off ERA but, after failing to get a good price, hung on to the asset and continued to mine at Ranger. “We very quickly turned our attention to Rio Tinto. We expected a big argument with them,” says Justin O’Brien, the chief executive of the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation, which represents the Mirarr. “And we found that they were willing to step back and to provide free prior and informed consent to Jabiluka.” Rio signed a care and maintenance agreement with the Mirarr people in 2005 that stops it mining Jabiluka unless the traditional owners consent. By 2012, the Ranger mine was tapped out. Processing of stockpiled uranium ore continued until last year, but since then the mine has been nothing but a vast hole in the ground that ERA is responsible for filling at an ever-increasing cost. When Rio looks at ERA, it sees little more than this multibillion-dollar liability. It values shares in the company at about 2c, about a tenth of their current market price. Rio also cannot afford any further damage to its relationship with First Nations people, after blowing up ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. That disaster cost the jobs of three senior executives, including the CEO. Kellie Parker, whose position of Australia CEO was created in response to the Juukan Gorge disaster, says the debacle taught the company that “Rio Tinto doesn’t have a home, we’re always hosted on someone else’s country”. “So, here in this situation, it’s the Mirarr people. They are the most important and understanding what they want and understanding how they want to see the future is critical,” Parker says. Rio also doesn’t currently think uranium is among minerals needed to decarbonise the world economy. “Of course there is a public conversation that needs to happen in Australia about whether they want uranium mining,” Parker says. “At the moment, we don’t see that that actually has public support. “So we’re fully committed to Ranger rehabilitation and we’re staying within our critical minerals – our copper, aluminium – and decarbonising iron ore.” A carbon-lite resource Where Rio sees an expensive hole, ERA’s minority shareholders see the opposite – a clean, green, multibillion-dollar opportunity. Willy Packer, of Packer &amp; Co, which owns 7.9% of ERA, describes Jabiluka as a “magical” deposit that can help fight global warming. “If Rio truly believes ERA shares are worth 2c, or less than one tenth of their market value, then Rio should put its stake in ERA on the market and let someone else with long-term commitment take control of this incredible asset,” he says. Another minority shareholder, Richard Magides, of Zentree Investments, says previous estimates value the uranium at Jabiluka and below Ranger as high as $25bn. “Nuclear power is without doubt a vital source of zero-carbon base load power and has been described by many environmental scientists as critical in addressing [climate change],” he says. Sweeney says that while it is true that nuclear power is low carbon, “that’s not the only lens for what is desirable, responsible, or less desirable and risky”. “If it was easy, if it was sensible, if it was good, they would have done it,” he says. While Magides and Packer dream of a nuclear boom that would make Jabiluka worth tens of billions of dollars, the valuation report released last week came up with a more conservative price tag of $1.1bn. But O’Brien says the valuation is “completely absurd”. “The traditional owners have said no so many times,” he says. “It is never going to happen. Its value is zero.” To those still pushing uranium mining in Kakadu, he had one message: “It’s over. Walk away.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/19/scholz-stalls-on-ukraine-tanks-decision-but-looks-poised-to-give-go-ahead","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T19:54:57Z","webTitle":"Scholz stalls on Ukraine tanks decision but looks poised to give go-ahead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/19/scholz-stalls-on-ukraine-tanks-decision-but-looks-poised-to-give-go-ahead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/19/scholz-stalls-on-ukraine-tanks-decision-but-looks-poised-to-give-go-ahead","fields":{"headline":"Scholz stalls on Ukraine tanks decision but looks poised to give go-ahead","bodyText":"Less than a year ago it would have seemed barely imaginable that the German state would be supplying arms in a conflict. Yet now the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, finds himself under mounting international pressure to give an unconditional green light for German-made tanks to be sent to Ukraine – having tentatively signalled his readiness to do so, but only if the US agrees to do the same. Even though Germany is often reluctant to spread the message itself, it is among Ukraine’s leading supporters in terms of defence aid and humanitarian and economic help. It has given refuge to hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, a very underreported aspect of its support. Its policy shift on Russian gas – from which German industry profited for so long, and which it has managed to wean itself off in double-quick time (even as it has opened a new brown coal opencast mine and extended the life of three nuclear power plants) is a reminder of how good at swift U-turns Germany can be. Scholz has made clear he wants to protect Germany from accusations of going it alone. Since the start of the invasion, he has repeatedly expressed his insistence that Germany will only commit to an increase in military support if it is in conjunction with a decision from other countries to do the same. Ukraine has continuously stressed that the tanks are necessary to give its troops the mobile firepower they need to drive out Russian troops. Scholz used an address to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday to insist that Germany would “continue, together with our partners” to deliver weapons in large quantities. He went on to cite at length the list of specific items Germany had already sent, including anti-aircraft systems, artillery guns and armoured personnel carriers, calling it part of a deep and extensive “sea change” in German foreign and security policy. But he stopped short of responding to Ukraine’s request for Leopard 2 tanks, even as he was repeatedly pushed to do so. Wolfgang Ischinger, a former head of the Munich Security Conference, warned Scholz that he was in danger of isolating Germany. “The whole world is waiting for Germany – with or without the USA – to give the green light,” he told the broadcaster DLF. Observers of the Scholz government believe that even as its message over arms to Ukraine has more often than not appeared ambivalent, the fact that Germany has so far committed to the effort in a manner that would have seemed almost unthinkable before the invasion is a strong indication that it will soon say yes to the tanks. It nevertheless remains morally trapped, on the one hand by the haunting fact that continues to horrify many Germans – that under the Nazis, it was fighting on Ukrainian soil against ancestors of the very people it now wants to protect – and on the other by the fact that it is as a direct result of that war that it has more of an obligation than any other country towards Ukraine. Scholz’s struggle has been to communicate domestically, in particular, the necessity to protect Ukrainians, even as he fears that to upgrade to contributing fighter tanks could risk an escalation of the conflict, with Germany pinpointed as an aggressor. Critics meanwhile are quick to point out that Germany’s defence industry has made billions from exporting lethal weapons to highly questionable regimes around the world. In this light, they argue, its hesitancy to provide a fledgling democracy on its doorstep with the means – in the form of its bestselling Leopard – to defend itself against Russian aggression is perverse. An editorial in the Süddeutsche Zeitung said Scholz could be expected to deliver the tanks, explaining it was in his manner to put off making decisions until there was no other choice. It expressed sympathy for his hesitancy. “It is far from being cut and dried that Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, will continue to take it on the chin that Nato states are increasingly involved in the war. Might he consider the use of atomic weapons in the case he feels he is at an impasse? No one can exclude this possibility,” it said. But it said Scholz would have no other option than to deliver the tanks, owing to his promise to “support Kyiv until the war is over” and the “undeniable” fact that tanks would help Ukraine fend off attacks from Putin’s army. “He will jump through the hoop – just too late for many who have been holding it up for him for months,” the paper wrote. Ralf Stegner, of the Social Democrats, stuck up for Scholz during a Bundestag debate on the future of weapons to Ukraine on Thursday. What others called “hesitation” was “in truth intelligent leadership”, he said, while one member of the conservative CDU said history was in danger of remembering the current German government as being most efficient as “a brake block”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-330-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T10:51:42Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 330 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-330-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-330-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 330 of the invasion","bodyText":"Oleksiy Kuleba, governor of Kyiv, said Thursday that ten adults and six children remain in hospital following Wednesday’s helicopter crash which claimed the life of interior minister Denys Monastyrskiy and 14 other people. Kuleba said families of the victims will receive financial assistance, and that children from the kindergarten damaged when the helicopter fell are studying in nearby preschools. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne is reporting that eleven people are still considered missing after Saturday’s attack on a high-rise building in Dnipro. The Kremlin said on Thursday that Ukrainian strikes on Russian-annexed Crimea would be “extremely dangerous”, after the New York Times reported that US officials were warming to the idea of helping Kyiv strike the peninsula. “This will mean raising the conflict to a new level that will not bode well for European security”, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters at his daily briefing. Crimea, which is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, was annexed by Russia in 2014. The comments came as the Sweden announced it would be sending the Archer artillery system for use by Kyiv, a vehicle-mounted self-propelled gun howitzer made by Bofors BAE. The country has also committed to sending infantry fighting vehicles in a move announced in a press conference in Stockholm on Thursday morning. The British and Polish defence ministers will meet with their counterparts from the Baltic states in Estonia, in a Ramstein pre-meeting – ahead of a wider defence summit on Friday – designed to put further pressure on Germany to move forward with sending Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. A government source in Berlin told Reuters Germany will send German-made tanks to Ukraine so long as the United States agrees to do likewise, as Nato partners remained out of step over how best to arm Ukraine in its war against Russia. Germany’s president Frank-Walter Steinmeier promised further military support to Ukraine and warned the incoming defence minister that Germany’s armed forces must once again become capable of protecting the nation. Social Democrat Boris Pistorius was officially made minister on Thursday in a ceremony attended by Steinmeier. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy”. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish long-term ally of Vladimir Putin, has warned of a nuclear escalation if Russia is defeated in Ukraine, saying that western politicians “repeated like a mantra: ‘To achieve peace, Russia must lose’”, but “it never occurs to any of them to draw the following elementary conclusion from this: the loss of a nuclear power in a conventional war can provoke the outbreak of a nuclear war”. Peskov later said the comments made by the deputy chairman of the security council of Russia were fully in accordance with Russia’s nuclear doctrine. Former UK prime minister Boris Johnson, speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, said people can spend too much time obsessing about Putin, and worrying about escalating the conflict. “How can you escalate against a guy who is doing all out war against a civilian population?”, he said. He also cast doubt on whether Russia would use nuclear weapons and internationally isolate itself from countries like China. Canada announced Wednesday it would donate 200 armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”, referring to the helicopter crash in Brovary. Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. The former Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov and finance minister Assen Vassilev said their country – one of the poorest EU members and long perceived as pro-Moscow – provided 30% of the Soviet-calibre ammunition Ukraine’s army needed during a crucial three-month period last spring, and at times 40% of the diesel. Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Andrzej Duda told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Russia was still strong and that more action was needed to support Ukraine, saying current levels of assistance were inadequate. Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby village of Klishchiivka, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts. “We notice a gradual increase in the number of shelling occasions and attempts at offensive actions by the occupiers,” Zelenskiy said in his latest address."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/10/morning-mail-mps-hillsong-claims-climate-coffee-shock-catholic-order-in-court-over-school-abuse","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T19:55:02Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: MP’s Hillsong claims, climate ‘coffee shock’, Catholic order in court over school abuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/10/morning-mail-mps-hillsong-claims-climate-coffee-shock-catholic-order-in-court-over-school-abuse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/10/morning-mail-mps-hillsong-claims-climate-coffee-shock-catholic-order-in-court-over-school-abuse","fields":{"headline":"Morning Mail: MP’s Hillsong claims, climate ‘coffee shock’, Catholic order in court over school abuse","bodyText":"Morning everyone. Armed with two large stacks of folders, the independent MP Andrew Wilkie ended the parliamentary week with an extraordinary set of accusations about the Hillsong church, including using funds for shopping that “would embarrass a Kardashian”. We’ve got the full story, plus how climate change could cause a shortage of your favourite coffee beans, and the day that cricket met Game of Thrones. Australia Coffee shock | Australians could run short of their favourite beans because changing climate conditions that reduce the yield have become more frequent over the past four decades, raising the prospect of “systemic shocks” to production, researchers say. Hillsong claims | Andrew Wilkie has used parliamentary privilege to accuse the mega-church Hillsong of money laundering and tax evasion which he says is proved by leaked documents. Wilkie claimed the church had used “private jets like Ubers” and lavished money on luxury watches, luggage sets and holidays. But the church has disputed many of the accusations as false or out of context. Church charge | A Catholic order is expected to argue today it should be shielded from abuse claims relating to one of the worst paedophiles in the New South Wales Catholic school system because he is dead, despite allegedly concealing his crimes from authorities for decades. NSW election | The Perrottet government has introduced new rules that will grant coalmines licences for water from the drinking catchment for Sydney and the Illawarra region, in what opponents called a “cynical” move. ‘It’s ginormous’ | An out-of-control bushfire in New South Wales’s central west could keep going for weeks, the Rural Fire Service has warned, after it blazed through properties and scorched bushland. World ‘No evidence’ | Dominion Voter Systems and Fox News have exchanged further barbs. The voting machine company is asking a judge to settle its $1.6bn libel case in its favour because Fox had “produced no evidence” supporting its claims of vote rigging in the 2020 election. Missile barrage | Russia has unleashed its largest missile attack on Ukraine in weeks, targeting energy infrastructure including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, while Kyiv’s forces are still holding on in Bakhmut despite heavy casualties. Trudeau pressure | Justin Trudeau is under mounting pressure to explain how his government has responded to the threat of Chinese interference in Canadian elections after damning intelligence leaks. ‘Jaw-dropping’ | The pay packet for the recently departed chief executive of Shell jumped more than 50% to nearly £10m (A$18m) in 2022 including a bonus labelled “jaw-dropping” by campaigners. ‘Are you kidding?’ | Basic Instinct star Sharon Stone says judicial prejudice caused her to lose custody of her son after the presiding judge in her 2004 divorce case asked the four-year-old whether he knew his mother made “sex movies”. Full Story Is the UK adopting Australia’s cruel mistakes? – with Lenore Taylor As the British government launches its own “stop the boats” policy, Lenore Taylor and Mike Ticher discuss the enduring inhumanity of Australia’s immigration regime and whether the UK will learn from our mistakes. In-depth Australia is expected to buy both US and British-designed nuclear submarines in a deal that is anticipated to be unveiled next week when Anthony Albanese attends an Aukus defence pact summit with the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the US president, Joe Biden, in San Diego. Our defence correspondent, Daniel Hurst, has been talking to the man in charge of the nuclear subs project, V Adm Jonathan Mead, who has hailed it as a “generational challenge” that will transform Australia’s “strategic personality”. Not the news Our writers have been sifting through the best Australian books to be published this week (pictured) and they include Sam Neill’s eagerly awaited memoir, Did I Ever Tell You This?, as well as Infidelity and Other Affairs by Kate Legge, which details the impact of her husband’s 30-year-long philandering. We’ve also got Margaret Simons’s biography of Tanya Plibersek, forged, apparently, by a mutual love of Jane Austen. The world of sport Cricket | Usman Khawaja’s resilient century has put Australia into a position of dominance after the first day of the fourth Test, confirming his place as currently the team’s most important batsman. The cricket was preceded by a bizarre political rally for Indian PM Narendra Modi which also featured Anthony Albanese, pictured. Football | Manchester United have added Chelsea’s Mason Mount to a list of attacking midfield targets including Jude Bellingham, along with a possible bid for Harry Kane. Women’s World Cup | Corinne Diacre has been sacked a coach of the French women’s team after some stars refused to play in the World Cup. Media roundup The Herald Sun says there are fears for jobs at the Maryvale Mill, Latrobe Valley’s biggest employer, with the state government accused of not doing enough to save the sector. The NT News reports on a “dramatic” navy rescue of six people on board a luxury yacht that got into difficulties in the Arafura Sea off Indonesia. And the Australian reports on a Senate committee that’s recommending the government set up a trial of a four-day work week. What’s happening today Canberra | An inquiry into supporting democracy in the region will hear from the Australian Council For International Development, the Australian Electoral Commission and Save the Children. WikiLeaks | Supporters of Julian Assange will gather to unveil a statue of the detained whistleblower in Sydney.

The video was taken down, but not before it received 18m views. Welcome to the Russia-Ukraine conflict on TikTok. TikTok has 1 billion users worldwide and is an important news source for adults and particularly those under 25. A quarter of US adults say they always use TikTok to get the news, with nearly half of US millennial and Gen Z adults – under-41s and under-25s respectively – indicating the same, according to analysis firm Forrester Research. Mike Proulx, a research director at Forrester, says TikTok’s algorithm, which curates what users see, has combined with the app’s popularity to make it a compelling outlet for people looking for information on the conflict. “The confluence of social media and mobile has enabled everyone to be instant, on-the-ground publishers. Add TikTok’s algorithm and popularity into the mix, and you get the perfect storm of content virality,” he says. According to Forrester, half of adults under 25 in the UK use TikTok at least once a week. Ukraine footage on TikTok varies wildly, from satirical commentary to false footage and accurate news clips. A London-based TikToker, Nikita Redkar, has received nearly 3m views for her tongue-in-cheek clip describing the conflict like a relationship breakdown: “Back in the 90s Russia and Ukraine used to be a thing but things got really messy and they broke up.” An even more popular follow-up post, captioned “Will there be a WW3?” continues with the theme, describing Nato as a “group of besties” who cannot support Ukraine because “you don’t roll with the crew”. Pdotz, a popular British TikToker with more than half a million followers, has received about 3m views for his explainers on the conflict. Other posts are from TikTok users presenting looped footage as live images from the conflict. An example of this included a video flagged by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) in which live footage purportedly from the point of view of a Ukrainian soldier was in fact on a loop. The account that posed the footage, and similar videos, received millions of views before disappearing. CCDH says it is problematic that TikTok videos do not show where a clip was posted, meaning that viewers are unable to discern whether footage ostensibly from the frontlines of the conflict is posted from Moscow, for instance. Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of CCDH, says TikTok has unique features that allow the rapid spread of false information. “The algorithm is currently aggressively promoting Ukraine-related content, irrespective of whether it’s true or not,” he said. “Unlike other platforms, it also provides users with little metadata with which users can do their own verification work – or even find out where this footage is coming from.” TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, says it took down the “RUSIA NUCLEAR BOMB” video for violating its community guidelines on integrity and authenticity. TikTok says it will also remove accounts that violate those guidelines although the account behind the nuclear video is still live. A TikTok spokesperson said: “We continue to respond to the war in Ukraine with increased safety and security resources to detect emerging threats and remove harmful misinformation and other violations of our community guidelines. We also partner with independent factchecking organisations to support our efforts to help TikTok remain a safe and authentic place.” TikToks about misinformation, and how to spot it, are also proving popular. Abbie Richards, a TikToker with 536,000 followers who regularly posts on misinformation, has received more than half a million views for her guide to spotting false videos – including overdubbed audio and recycling old footage. Old footage has proved popular. One video captioned “Ukrainian soldiers saying goodbye to their families” has had 2.8m views but is clearly footage of US soldiers and their loved ones. Video game footage has also been adapted, with one clip purportedly showing a Ukrainian jet downing a Russian fighter – which has had nearly 10m views and is still live – but can be traced to a YouTube video made on a flight simulator game. The ITV News TikTok account is posting regularly on Ukraine and is garnering up to 400,000 views for its posts, but pales in comparison with less expert accounts with the same, or fewer, followers. There is nothing unusual about TikTok’s algorithm compared with other platforms, according to Julian McAuley, a professor of computer science at the University of California, San Diego. “TikTok uses fairly ‘standard’ recommendation technology that will mostly recommend content that’s consistent with what users have previously engaged with. If users frequently consume misinformation (or slanted content), they’re likely to see more of it.” Russian influencers are also getting involved. Niki Proshin, a 27-year-old Russian TikToker with 765,00 followers, posted a video in which he said he was speaking for “regular Russians” and “normal people in Russia do not support this [war]”. Meanwhile, Marta Vasyuta, a Ukrainian-British TikToker with 187,000 followers, has been regularly posting footage of the conflict that has attracted millions of views from users on the platform. Asked why she was posting the footage, Vasyuta said: “I want more people to be aware about what is going on in my country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/04/sainsburys-renames-chicken-kievs-kyivrussian-made-vodka-uk-supermarket-soviet-spelling-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T19:13:00Z","webTitle":"Sainsbury’s renames chicken kievs and pulls Russian-made vodka","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/04/sainsburys-renames-chicken-kievs-kyivrussian-made-vodka-uk-supermarket-soviet-spelling-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/04/sainsburys-renames-chicken-kievs-kyivrussian-made-vodka-uk-supermarket-soviet-spelling-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Sainsbury’s renames chicken kievs and pulls Russian-made vodka","bodyText":"Sainsbury’s is changing the name of its chicken kiev to chicken kyiv and is joining Waitrose, Aldi and Morrisons in withdrawing a Russian-made vodka from the shelves in the latest action by British retailers to signal solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The UK’s second biggest supermarket said the packaging for the poultry dish would change in the next few weeks, switching the Soviet-era name for the country’s capital for the Ukrainian version. The move comes after several smaller operators announced a switch to chicken kyiv, including the Better Naked brand and Essex-based Our Local Butcher. Marks &amp; Spencer, which popularised the dish in the UK after making chicken kiev one of the first ready meals in 1979, has also come under pressure to rename the dish. A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s said: “We stand united with the people of Ukraine. We have reviewed our product range and have decided to remove from sale all products that are 100% sourced from Russia. “This means that from today we will no longer sell two products – Russian Standard vodka and Karpayskiye black sunflower seeds.” Sainsbury’s said it had also reviewed JJ Whitley products, a range of vodkas and other spirits made in Russia. It said those would continue to be sold in its supermarkets as the drinks company had said it was moving all production to Chorley in Lancashire by the end of this month. Waitrose said on Friday it would be removing one Russian vodka, while its sister department store chain, John Lewis, will remove a line of pizza oven pellets that are sourced from Russia. Aldi said it would remove Russian vodka on Friday after the Co-op and Morrisons did the same earlier in the week. Carmen Bryan, consumer analyst at GlobalData, said: “Governments have been implementing sanctions, however, it is interesting to see similar moves from the wider public and independent businesses. “GlobalData’s survey reveals that brand loyalty is heavily influenced by alignment to one’s values. This puts Russian vodka brands in a precarious position, as prolonged conflict will not only damage immediate sales, but may also cause permanent disillusionment against Russian commodities in the long-term.” The removal of Russian vodka from supermarket shelves comes after M&amp;S suspended shipments to its franchisee’s business in Russia on Thursday. It joined a rush of western firms halting operations in Russia, including Swedish furnishing retailer Ikea, which announced that it had temporarily closed all stores and factories across the country in a move affecting 15,000 workers. On Friday, JD Sports, which sells to Russia via its website, said it was joining British online retailers Boohoo and Asos in suspending sales in the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/mar/04/uk-to-speed-up-sanctions-on-russian-oligarchs-by-copying-allies-decisions","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T19:10:02Z","webTitle":"UK to speed up sanctions on Russian oligarchs by copying allies’ decisions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/04/uk-to-speed-up-sanctions-on-russian-oligarchs-by-copying-allies-decisions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/mar/04/uk-to-speed-up-sanctions-on-russian-oligarchs-by-copying-allies-decisions","fields":{"headline":"UK to speed up sanctions on Russian oligarchs by copying allies’ decisions","bodyText":"The UK government is planning emergency powers to immediately sanction people who have already been sanctioned by the US or EU, in response to a barrage of criticism that it has been too slow to target Russian oligarchs. Amendments to sanctions laws tabled by Priti Patel, the home secretary, would introduce a new “urgent procedure” to give the UK the legal ability to sanction individuals on the basis of other countries while it builds up its own cases. Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, prompting a wave of financial sanctions from the EU and the US. However, on Friday the UK had only imposed sanctions on 15 individuals and 205 companies. The urgent designation will be limited to 56 days, according to the amendment, seen by the Guardian. That would mean that Foreign Office officials would still have to build up a legal case for the sanctions to the same standards. However, it could allow UK officials to move more quickly to follow allies. Officials in EU member states have expressed frustrations about the UK’s slow pace. On Thursday, Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s first vice-president said the UK would “continue to follow the [EU’s] lead because the pressure of the public opinion in the UK is very clear about this”. The changes are being brought as part of amendments to a long-delayed economic crime bill that has been spurred by the invasion. They are aimed at “streamlining the process by which an appropriate minister can make designations for the purposes of sanctions regulations”, according to an attached explanatory statement. The amendment says that the minister can rely on “corresponding” provisions brought under laws in the USA, the EU, Australia and Canada, as well as any other country specified by ministers. Dame Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP who has long campaigned for tougher anti-corruption laws, said the amendments appeared to be “a win for parliament” that would give the power to sanction Russian oligarchs more quickly. “The government is seeing sense and putting in place the emergency legislation that we have been calling for to ensure that we can quickly sanction the Russian oligarchs propping up Putin’s regime,” she said. “For too long the UK has been the jurisdiction of choice for dirty money. And now we are a global laughing stock as we have lagged behind our allies with our utter failure to effectively sanction Putin’s oligarch cronies.” Tom Keatinge, a financial crime expert at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank (RUSI), said the changes may reflect a realisation in government that it has been unable to act quickly enough during the crisis. “Clearly the UK’s frustration with its ability to enact its own laws means it is going to have to rely on the designations of other countries,” he said. Other amendments include reducing an implementation period for foreign owners to declare their beneficial ownership of UK property from 18 months to six months – as called for by Hodge and other MPs – as well as raising minimum daily fines for failing to disclose information required under the economic crime bill from £500 to £2,500. Hodge said: “Tougher financial penalties and a six-month implementation period will make the new property register more effective in shining a light on any crook or kleptocrat that wishes to use our property market to hide their ill-gotten gains.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2022/mar/04/uk-universities-impact-sanctions-russia-academmics-boycott","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T10:17:25Z","webTitle":"UK universities brace for impact of sanctions against Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/04/uk-universities-impact-sanctions-russia-academmics-boycott","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2022/mar/04/uk-universities-impact-sanctions-russia-academmics-boycott","fields":{"headline":"UK universities brace for impact of sanctions against Russia","bodyText":"Researchers at UK universities are bracing themselves for sanctions affecting science partnerships with Russia, including in climate science and space research, as the government seeks to isolate Vladimir Putin over the invasion of Ukraine. Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at the University of Oxford, said most academics would support a research boycott with heavy hearts and concerns for Russian colleagues. “All the Russian academics I know oppose the war. The internal situation in Russia will get nastier and they will need solidarity, so there is a case for maintaining ties,” he said. Germany announced that all collaboration with Russia on education and research was being halted immediately. Its ministry of education said Russia had “turned its back on the international community” by invading Ukraine and was committing a “grave breach of international law” with no justification. This week George Freeman, the UK science minister, said he had ordered “a rapid review” of all Russian beneficiaries of UK science and technology funding. Experts say possible sanctions could include a ban on British academics collaborating with Russian scientists, the freezing of any joint funding, and the exclusion of Russian scientists from reading or publishing in international scientific journals. Prof Colin Riordan, the vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, a member of the prestigious Russell Group, said some Cardiff academics had withdrawn from events in Russia of their own accord. If the government were to tell his university to cut ties with Russia, it would do so because of the “bigger things at stake”. But he said the government should be careful about any blanket ruling banning all collaboration with Russian academics. “We need to distinguish between the government and citizens of Russia who find themselves in an extremely difficult position,” he said. Prof Steve West, the president of the vice-chancellors’ group Universities UK, told the Guardian: “I think we have to expect science sanctions. The position of universities is always that scientific collaboration and research are a vital global endeavour. However, what is happening is a challenge on democracy and the safety and stability of the free world.” Academics in Russia, thousands of whom have signed open letters opposing the war, say their international relationships are fracturing. They say academics from across Europe are cancelling trips and pulling out of partnerships. Almost 4,000 academics, students and graduates of the prestigious Moscow State University, Russia’s oldest university, have signed a letter saying they “categorically condemn the war that our country unleashed in Ukraine”. The letter says: “There is no room for euphemisms or excuses. War is violence, cruelty, death, loss of loved ones, powerlessness and fear that cannot be justified by any goal.” Another condemnatory open letter on Thursday had been signed by more than 15,000 Russian academics and students. A senior Russian scientist, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said some science leaders had been accused of “betraying the motherland” by speaking out against the war. Many were afraid to sign the letters because of a “culture of fear”. “People in the west do not fully understand the pain we feel,” he said. “It is like England invading Scotland. Many of us have relatives in Ukraine or were born there.” He said he knew academics in Russia who had written privately to research partners in the UK and other countries, stressing that they did not support the invasion of Ukraine, and expressing hope that they might find a way of continuing to work together. A Russian scientist in St Petersburg, who said he had been chased by riot police this week, tweeted: “I’m so disgusted with rejection letters, invitation cancellations, grant withdrawals against Russian scholars from Western academics who fight Putinism by attacking those who have suffered from it for decades.” A Russian climate scientist based at a leading Russell Group university in the UK, speaking on condition of anonymity, said his field work, which was based in Russia and involved Russian scientists in different disciplines, looked likely to grind to a halt. A joint expedition he had been planning with colleagues in Moscow has been cancelled. “Russia is such a huge territory and we will lose so much empirical data. This will be a really big blow for climate science.” The scientist, who said he was “appalled and devastated” by the invasion of Ukraine, added: “The majority of academics in Russia are not fans of the current regime, and of course sanctions will strike right at them.” Paul Nightingale, a professor of strategy at Sussex’s University’s science policy research unit, said measures should be adopted that would “be brutal and would achieve the aim of turning more people against Putin”. In addition to curbs on collaboration and publishing, Britain and the US could consider offering five-year working visas to every Russian with a PhD, he said, to prompt a brain drain from the country, although he added that this could damage hopes of Russia becoming a more liberal society in the future. Nightingale, formerly a director of special projects at the UK government’s Economic and Social Research Council, said he was in favour of sanctions to isolate Putin in the coming weeks, but they must be imposed carefully to avoid killing the possibility of useful academic diplomacy. “Even during the worst of the cold war, American, European and Russian scientists would work together on important problems,” he said. “Those social networks provided really important back channels for communication. “Unfortunately the people we would be hurting most in trying to damage Putin would be our friends.” Isak Froumin, professor of higher education at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, said global science had been very important to Putin’s regime. Until 2018 the Russian government was pushing universities hard to play more of a role in global science by collaborating with researchers abroad and publishing in international journals, he said. “International collaboration in science was considered absolutely necessary and prestigious.” He added: “The idea that might be all broken is a great shock to scientists.” Prof James Wilsdon, the director of the Research on Research Institute, based at Sheffield University, said the UK government was likely to focus sanctions on areas with strategic security implications for Russia, including climate science in the arctic and space research. He warned that in the longer term ministers must be careful not to “choke off the good”. “Links in science are a very important part of maintaining what spark of freedom there is in Russia,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/feb/01/environmentalists-animal-free-meat-livestock-farming","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-01T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"'Let them eat lentils' won't save us from animal farming – we must embrace meat substitutes | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/01/environmentalists-animal-free-meat-livestock-farming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/01/environmentalists-animal-free-meat-livestock-farming","fields":{"headline":"‘Let them eat lentils’ won’t save us from animal farming – we must embrace meat substitutes","bodyText":"Do you hate the idea of animal-free meat? Many people do. Unsurprisingly, livestock farmers are often furiously opposed. More surprisingly, so are some vegans: “Why can’t people eat tofu and lentils, like me?” Well, the new products – plant-based, microbial and cell-cultured meat and dairy – are not aimed at vegans, but at the far greater number who like the taste and texture of animals. Many others instinctively recoil from the idea of food that seems familiar, but isn’t. So here’s a question for all the sceptics. What do you intend to do about the soaring global demand for animal products, and its devastating impacts? Already, 60% of the mammals on Earth by weight are livestock. Humans account for 36%, wild mammals for just 4%. Of birds, poultry make up 71%, wild species only 29%. While the human population is growing at 1% a year, the livestock population is growing at 2.4%. Global average meat consumption per person is 43kg a year, but swiftly heading towards the UK level of 82kg. The reason is Bennett’s Law: as people become richer, they eat more protein and fat, especially the flesh and secretions of animals. So, if you don’t like the new technologies, what solution do you propose? I keep asking, and the response is either furious or evasive. “It’s the wrong question!” “Who’s paying you?” “Do you want us to eat slime?” So far, only one of the people I’ve asked has answered it directly: the food campaigner Vandana Shiva. “You blindly echo the myth that as people get richer they eat more meat. Indians continue to be vegetarians even when they become rich. Food cultures are shaped by cultural and ecological values.” But meat-eating in India is rising rapidly, though many people do it secretly. In other words, despite religious proscriptions, enforced with vigilantism and, in some cases, murder, Bennett’s Law still applies. It’s as if we were urging people to burn less fossil fuel without offering a replacement: no solar, wind, geothermal or nuclear power. This issue is just as urgent, arguably even more so, as livestock farming attacks every Earth system. It’s the primary agent of habitat destruction and wildlife loss. It’s causing rivercide and dead zones at sea. It generates more greenhouse gas emissions than all the world’s transport. It sprawls across vast tracts of the planet, inflicting massive carbon and ecological opportunity costs. Both historically and currently, livestock farming is probably the world’s most powerful agent of colonial land grabbing and the displacement of Indigenous people. Meat is consuming the planet. Substitutes for animal products can greatly reduce this damage. They can allow vast areas to be returned to dispossessed people and the ecosystems they defended. The first cell-cultured meat recently gained regulatory approval in the United States. At the same time, the taste and texture of plant-based alternatives has greatly improved. I’ve recently eaten three products that are almost indistinguishable from the originals: a steak made by a Slovenian company called Juicy Marbles, a “lamb” fillet from the Israeli company Redefine Meat, and sushi and tempura “seafood” at the London restaurant 123V. In response, Big Meat has ramped up its campaign of demonisation. That’s understandable. Less so is the support the animal industry receives from people who claim to be green, but happily recite its misleading propaganda. The professor of food and agricultural policy Robert Paarlberg compares this alliance to the inadvertent coalition of Baptists and bootleggers in the US a century ago. By lobbying successfully for the prohibition of alcohol, the Southern Baptists opened the door to gangsters trading in stronger and more dangerous drink. True environmentalists have a duty to break this ultra-conservative consensus. Adoption of the new technologies is likely to follow an S-curve: slow, then sudden. At first, uptake will be low and will suffer repeated setbacks. But as scale rises and prices fall, market penetration is likely to reach 10% or more. That’s the point at which linear growth suddenly switches to exponential growth. It’s a trend we’ve seen in dozens of technologies, from refrigerators to smartphones. The biggest hurdles will be political. As governments are pressurised by Big Meat, they will raise the kind of obstacles that, in the UK and US, have delayed the rollout of renewable electricity. The UK government, for example, is reported to be considering a ban on calling plant-based products “milk” and “butter”. What it will do about coconut milk and peanut butter is anyone’s guess. No VAT is charged on meat and milk here, but most plant-based alternatives must pay 20%. The regulators that might approve the new products are often overwhelmed. Brexit has dumped a massive workload on the UK’s Food Standards Agency and its budget falls far short of what it needs. At the same time, it has been flooded with applications for CBD (cannabidiol) products: it could be years before it can assess alternative proteins. None of these questions should be left to industry and government. Environmental campaigners should be working not to destroy the green alternatives but to ensure they are regulated properly and, through effective anti-trust laws, do not become as concentrated in the hands of a few corporations as the meat trade is. As always, this will be a political struggle as much as a technological one. And we need to decide which team we are on.

The Home Office said it had increased its weekly visa processing appointments in the region from 500 to 6,000 a week to speed up applications from individuals hoping to join relatives in Britain, and increased the amount of time people will be allowed to stay in Britain from one to three years. Officials said it was too soon to say how many people would apply. With the UN reporting that 1 million people have already left their homes in Ukraine, and warning that 4 million could flee the country if the conflict escalates, refugee organisations called on the government to speed up the announcement of a wider humanitarian scheme. Officials have promised that an “unlimited sponsorship route” will open soon for Ukrainian’s without family ties here, allowing communities, local authorities and others to sponsor and support those in need to come to the UK, but say that details of how it will operate are still being worked out. The British Red Cross welcomed the family visa announcements, but called for the government to allow Ukrainians to travel here without a visa, “in line with the approach taken in the EU”, adding it was “vital that people who don’t have family in the UK are able to get here safely too”. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said it was not yet clear whether the schemes being devised by the government would match those already announced by the EU. “Any Ukrainian who wants to get to the UK should be able to do that through a safe and immediately accessible route. The most effective way would be to grant them humanitarian visas, to allow them to come as a refugee and be entitled to all the support that they need.” The Ukraine family scheme will allow parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren and siblings of British nationals and people settled in the UK to join relatives in the UK; they will be granted the right to work and to claim benefits. The scheme is radically different from the evacuation programme launched in response to the Afghanistan crisis in August, because officials assume that those who apply will stay with relatives and are not proposing to block book hotel rooms to accommodate them. More than 250 British immigration lawyers have come together to offer pro-bono assistance to people applying for visas; CJ McKinney, coordinating the Ukraine Advice Project, said dozens of emailed requests for help were coming in every hour. The home secretary, Priti Patel, visited Poland to look at the UK’s visa processing systems on Friday, and said: “While we want people to be able to return to their homes at the end of this diabolical invasion, giving thousands of people a route to the UK is the right thing to do.” Despite the launch of an expanded scheme, several Ukrainians trying to flee to the UK told the Guardian of difficulties they were having in obtaining visas. Yakiv Voloshchuk, 60, a British citizen, rescued his Ukrainian wife, Oksana Voloshchuk, 41, and their diabetic daughter, Veronika, 15, from Poland’s border with Ukraine on 26 February and drove them to the UK visa centre in Paris. They began to queue for a visa for Oksana and Veronika on Monday morning but say that even though they were eligible for the earlier visa scheme announced by the Home Office, Oksana and Veronika have still not obtained their visas. The family is becoming increasingly desperate and is running out of money. Adil Arslan is a British citizen living in the UK with his Ukrainian wife, Tetiana Hill, but her children, Maksym and Alina, Arslan’s stepchildren, are stranded in Ukraine, spending much of their time sheltering in an underground bunker. No visa has yet been granted even though the scheme announced on Friday includes stepchildren. The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has said there should be a more flexible “emergency protection visa”. “People need a simple and safe route to sanctuary right now,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/property-of-russian-elites-could-be-handed-to-ukrainian-refugees-says-raab","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T17:54:01Z","webTitle":"Property of Russian elites could be handed to Ukrainian refugees, says Raab","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/property-of-russian-elites-could-be-handed-to-ukrainian-refugees-says-raab","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/property-of-russian-elites-could-be-handed-to-ukrainian-refugees-says-raab","fields":{"headline":"Property of Russian elites could be handed to Ukrainian refugees, says Raab","bodyText":"Russian elites could have their property seized and handed over to Ukrainian refugees, the deputy prime minister has suggested. Dominic Raab made the remarks as he defended the UK’s response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Asked whether Britain could capture property assets owned by Russian oligarchs, he told LBC: “If we’ve got the evidence and the legal basis, then we’ll do it.” Pressed on whether he would back using those properties to house Ukrainian refugees – a move called for by the Liberal Democrats and reportedly argued for in government by the housing secretary, Michael Gove – Raab replied: “Yes, absolutely. “We are looking at everything in the round, it is a team effort across government, from the foreign and defence secretary through to Michael Gove and, of course, the prime minister is driving this very hard.” The UK’s strategy appears to be based on trying to cause the whole Russian economy pain, which is why it has focused more on banking, state institutions and companies than individuals so far. However, government sources have repeatedly said they are planning to target more oligarchs and politically connected people in “weeks and months”. Also on the list will be all members of the Russian parliament from both houses, and members of the Russian security council who voted for the invasion. Two more oligarchs, Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov, faced sanctions on Thursday and their assets in the UK have been frozen. However, the Foreign Office refused to confirm whether any assets belonging to Vladimir Putin himself have been identified and frozen after sanctions against him last week. The Foreign Office is understood to be confident that Shuvalov owns flats in Westminster worth an estimated £11m, and that Usmanov owns a £48m mansion in Hampstead and a Tudor manor in Surrey, though a spokesperson for Usmanov on Wednesday denied he was the owner. It was unclear which property or properties the spokesperson was referring to, but it raises the prospect Usmanov may have tried to offload property or is contesting the asset freeze. Sources said individuals who had faced sanctions would no longer be allowed to repair their property without a licence, or rent or sell it. The UK government has faced criticism for being too slow in its approach to implementing sanctions against Russian figures and linked assets. The Labour party chair, Anneliese Dodds, said the UK had to “stop dragging” its feet in clamping down on funds that have come from figures linked to Putin. She told Sky News: “I certainly would say that we have been far too soft, especially over the last 10 years, on those funds that have come from Putin-linked oligarchs and business people.” She added: “We see, even with the new measures that finally have been extracted from the government now that they say they will announce on Monday, an 18-month window before they will come into action – that’s just not good enough. “We need immediate action now. We can put those registers of foreign-owned property into place in 28 days, we believe we could get those running and force that transparency.” Raab, however, said the UK was “at the vanguard” of imposing sanctions on Kremlin-linked money. Asked why the EU had imposed sanctions on more individual Russian elites than Britain had, he said on BBC Breakfast it was a “false distinction”, adding: “The question is not whether it is individuals or companies – it is where the money is flowing.” Separately, he said: “There has been a running commentary that the UK has somehow been slow – we’ve not been slow. We’ve been at the vanguard of taking action and, of course, what is really important is we act in concert with our allies, European, American and other Nato allies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/apr/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-to-station-nuclear-weapons-near-belaruss-western-border-envoy-says","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-03T18:13:46Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Moscow to station nuclear weapons near Belarus’s western border, envoy says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-to-station-nuclear-weapons-near-belaruss-western-border-envoy-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/apr/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-to-station-nuclear-weapons-near-belaruss-western-border-envoy-says","fields":{"headline":"US ‘pushing hard’ for Wall Street Journal reporter’s release, says White House – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Finland will become the 31st member of the world’s biggest military alliance on Tuesday, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. Stoltenberg said Turkey, the last country to ratify Finland’s membership, would hand its official texts to the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Tuesday. Stoltenberg said he would then invite Finland to do the same. Stoltenberg’s announcement prompted a warning from Russia that it would bolster its defences near their joint border if Nato deployed any troops inside the country. “We will strengthen our military potential in the west and in the north-west,” Grushko said in remarks carried by the RIA Novosti state news agency. Ukraine’s western allies have sent the country €65bn (£57bn) in military aid to help in its fight against Russia’s full-scale invasion, Stoltenberg said. He was speaking as Nato foreign ministers prepare to meet in Brussels on Tuesday to “discuss how we can step up our support, including by continuing to strengthen Ukraine’s armed forces”. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has paid tribute to the courage of nearly 400 villagers in north Ukraine who were held in a school basement under Russian occupation for 27 days before they were set free a year ago. The Ukrainian leader travelled to Yahidne on Monday, where he gave an emotive speech recalling how villagers were kept captive in a space of less than 200 sq metres during the first month of Russia’s February 2022 invasion. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, will visit the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on Wednesday, an IAEA spokesperson said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is scheduled to visit Poland on Wednesday for talks with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. Zelenskiy will be accompanied by his wife, Olena Zelenska, during his first official visit to Warsaw since Russia’s invasion 13 months ago. Zelenskiy is also expected to hold talks with Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. Poland has already delivered the first batch of Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, according to the Polish presidential office’s head of international policy, Marcin Przydacz. He did not specify how many jets had been transferred. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, last month said Warsaw would hand over the first four MiG-29 to Ukraine. Ukraine has said Russian forces are “very far” from capturing the eastern town of Bakhmut and that fighting raged around the city administration building where the Wagner mercenary group claims to have raised the Russian flag. “Bakhmut is Ukrainian, and they have not captured anything and are very far from doing that to put it mildly,” Serhiy Cherevatiy, a spokesperson for the eastern military command said. President Zelenskiy has said overnight the fighting in Bakhmut is “especially hot”. His comments came as the Wagner founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his troops had raised a Russian flag on the city’s administrative building. However, there was no indication from Ukrainian officials that Bakhmut had fallen into Russian hands and Prigozhin has previously made premature claims about Wagner’s military progress in the city. Russian police have arrested a woman suspected of delivering a bomb that killed a prominent pro-war Russian military blogger in a blast in a cafe in central St Petersburg on Sunday. Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was killed by a bomb blast as he hosted a discussion with other pro-war commentators at a cafe on the banks of the Neva River in the historic heart of the city. Police said they had identified a woman called Darya Trepova as the suspect and that she was arrested in a flat in St Petersburg after a search on Monday morning. Evan Gershkovich, the US journalist arrested on espionage charges in Russia last week, has appealed against his detention through his lawyers, according to a report. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Gershkovich’s arrest was “of concern” and called for his “immediate release”. The US government is “pushing hard” for the release of Evan Gershkovich, the White House said on Monday. Many people could have wanted to kill Vladlen Tatarsky, the pro-war Russian blogger who died in a bomb blast in a St Petersburg cafe on Sunday. Tatarsky, whose real name is Maxim Fomin, was notorious for his vehement support for the invasion of Ukraine, where he regularly called for Russia to commit to a total war and advocated for extreme violence that included war crimes. “We’ll defeat everyone, we’ll kill everyone, we’ll loot whoever we need to, and everything will be just as we like it,” he said last year on camera after a Kremlin ceremony confirming the “annexation” of four Ukrainian regions. A former coalminer from east Ukraine, Fomin was convicted of bank robbery and was serving a prison sentence in east Ukraine when Russian proxy forces launched their war against the government. Fomin claimed he then fled custody and joined the Russian-backed forces. Later, he became a blogger and moved to Moscow several years before Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion in 2022. After the war began, he claimed to have joined a volunteer battalion and fought in Mariupol. At the beginning of the war he became a member of a small but influential group of military bloggers who have been vocally supportive of the conflict, regularly posting updates citing troops on the frontlines or dangling scoops about potential offensives or big political decisions such as mobilisations. At the same time, they have also been some of the most virulent critics of Russia’s military effort, condemning the army’s top brass as ineffective and lazy, and uncaring for the lives of Russian troops sent into battle. Read the full story here: The German arms maker Rheinmetall is building a military maintenance and logistics hub in Satu Mare, Romania, that is expected to begin operation this month to service weapons used for the war in Ukraine, the company has said. The hub, located near the Ukrainian border, will service self-propelled howitzers, Leopard 2 and Challenger tanks, Marder infantry fighting vehicles, Fuchs armoured transport vehicles and military trucks, it said. A Rheinmetall spokesperson said on Sunday: The service hub should play a central role in maintaining the operational readiness of western combat systems in use in Ukraine and ensuring the availability of logistical support. The chief executive of the company, Armin Papperger, said it was a “key concern” to provide Nato forces and Ukraine “with the best possible support”. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, travelled to Romania today for talks with its president, Klaus Iohannis, that focused on security, economy and energy. They also discussed defence cooperation on Nato’s eastern flank and security in the Black Sea region. Scholz highlighted the strong relations between Germany and Romania and again promised to “give Ukraine military support for as long as it is necessary, and we are working on that constantly and together”. He did not directly answer questions on the Rheinmetall facility being set up in Romania. Iohannis and Scholz were later joined by Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, for talks on ways to support her embattled country. Moldova is Ukraine’s “most vulnerable neighbour”, Mandu told reporters, adding that “when our values are under attack, democratic countries must help each other”. Ukraine has received the first $2.7bn (£2.2bn) tranche under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) extended fund facility programme, finance minister Sergii Marchenko has said. The IMF said on Friday that its executive board had approved a four-year $15.6bn (£12.6bn) loan programme for Ukraine, part of a global $115bn (£92.8bn) package to support the country’s economy as it battles Russia’s invasion. The extended fund facility (EFF) loan is the first major conventional financing programme approved by the IMF for a country involved in a large-scale war. The decision cleared the way for the immediate disbursement of $2.7bn to Kyiv, and requires Ukraine to carry out ambitious reforms, especially in the energy sector, the Fund said in a statement. While we’re on the subject of western aid for Ukraine, the White House has said the US will send a new package of assistance to Ukraine this week. Ukraine is still fighting hard for the eastern city of Bakhmut and the battle is not over, White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. Ukraine’s western allies have sent the country €65bn (£57bn) in military aid to help the country in its fight against Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has said. “We cannot allow Russia to continue to chip away at European security,” Stoltenberg told a news conference as Nato foreign ministers prepare to meet in Brussels tomorrow to “discuss how we can step up our support, including by continuing to strengthen Ukraine’s armed forces”. Earlier we reported that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy travelled to Yahidne in northern Ukraine, where nearly 400 residents were kept captive in a school basement under Russian occupation for 27 days before they were set free a year ago. Eleven people died during the ordeal, Zelenskiy said. The Ukrainian leader was joined on the visit to the village in Chernihiv region by the German vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, and the Council of Europe secretary general, Marija Pejčinović Burić. Zelenskiy thanked Habeck and Burić for attending and said the basement was important for Ukraine’s allies to see. He said: It’s important to see this and to be in these basements to understand whether to help Ukraine or to keep thinking how to find a way to talk with Russia. Russian troops and the country’s leadership, including Vladimir Putin, were responsible for the tragedy, he said. He added: Having seen all this, I can wish the president of Russia to spend the rest of his days in a basement with a bucket for a toilet. The US government is “pushing hard” for the release of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter detained in Russia on espionage charges, the White House has said. National security council spokesperson, John Kirby, told reporters: We have been pushing hard since the moment we found out the reporter was detained. The US is “keenly, strongly, closely” tracking his detention, he added. The UN’s nuclear watchdog has said its head, Rafael Grossi, will travel to Russia’s Kaliningrad territory on Wednesday for talks on the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. Russian news agencies had earlier reported that Grossi would visit Moscow, citing a senior diplomat. But a spokesperson for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said he would visit the Russian Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad. Grossi will visit Kaliningrad “as part of his ongoing consultations aimed at ensuring the protection of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant during the military conflict”, the IAEA spokesperson said. Grossi visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which is in territory occupied by Russia since early in its invasion, last week. He said the situation had grown worse and military activity around the site had intensified in recent months. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Finland will become the 31st member of the world’s biggest military alliance on Tuesday, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said.

Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Gershkovich’s arrest was “of concern” and called for his “immediate release”. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, has said Moscow will strengthen its military in its western and north-western regions in response to Finland joining Nato tomorrow. He told Russian state-owned Ria news agency: In the event that the forces and resources of other Nato members are deployed in Finland, we will take additional steps to reliably ensure Russia’s military security. Finland has a 1,300km (810 mile) border with Russia, and joining Nato will roughly double the alliance’s frontier facing Moscow. Evan Gershkovich, the US journalist arrested on espionage charges in Russia last week, has appealed against his detention through his lawyers, Interfax news agency reported, citing the court. Gershkovich, 31, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, was detained on Wednesday in the Urals city of Ekaterinburg and accused by Russia’s FSB internal security agency of collecting “classified information” on a company in its military industrial complex. The WSJ says it “vehemently denies the allegations” and the White House has described the charges as “ridiculous”. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday paid tribute to the courage of nearly 400 residents of a village in north Ukraine who were held in a school basement under Russian occupation for 27 days before they were set free a year ago. The Ukrainian leader travelled to Yahidne, where he gave an emotive speech recalling how villagers were kept captive in a space of less than 200 sq metres during the first month of Russia’s February 2022 invasion. He said that 11 people died during the ordeal. “These people somehow lived and waited for Ukraine in the dark,” said Zelenskiy, who appeared visibly moved on the anniversary. “They lived standing and sitting.” Reuters reports that Zelenskiy was joined on the visit to Yahidne, a village in Chernihiv region, by the German vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, and the Council of Europe secretary general, Marija Pejčinović Burić. On his official Telegram channel, Zelenskiy wrote: I want to thank the residents of Yahidne. They endured torture, a terrible path, the path of absolute heroes. I thank Ukraine for having such fighters for life. Catherine Russell, the executive director of Unicef, the UN children’s fund, has commented on the announcement by the OHCHR Ukraine civilian casualty update team that the number of children killed in the conflict since February 2022 has risen to at least 501. She said: This is another tragic milestone for Ukraine’s children and families. Since the escalation of the war in February 2022, at least 501 children have been killed. This is just the UN-verified number. The real figure is likely far higher, and the toll on families affected is unimaginable. Almost 1,000 children have been injured, leaving them with wounds and scars – both visible and invisible – that could last for life. Children and families in Ukraine are paying the highest price for this brutal war. Behind every number is a family torn apart and changed for ever. It is heart-wrenching. War is always the worst enemy of children, whether in Ukraine, or countless other conflicts around the world. Every child, no matter where they live, deserves to grow up in a peaceful environment. Tatiana Moskalkova, commissioner for human rights in the Russian Federation, has told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass that Ukraine and Russia have swapped five injured prisoners of war in recent days. It quotes her saying: “Today, five wounded servicemen of the armed forces of Ukraine have been repatriated to Ukraine. We continue to work in this direction.” Tass reports that according to her, at the end of March, Ukraine handed over five wounded Russian soldiers who are currently being treated. “I wish them a speedy recovery and I believe that they will soon return to their families and friends, who will greet them as real heroes,” she is reported as saying. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that in the last day, in the Ukrainian-held areas of Kherson region, pyrotechnicians defused 56 explosive object in de-occupied settlements. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, will visit Russia on Wednesday, Russia’s permanent representative to international organisations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, told state television on Monday. Reuters reports Ulyanov said Grossi would meet a Russian delegation and that they would discuss the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, located in a Russian-occupied part of Ukraine, near the frontline of fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. Russian forces captured Europe’s largest nuclear power station in March 2022, and since then have been forcing Ukrainian staff to continue to operate it. Both sides have accused the other of shelling the power plant and risking a nuclear accident. Grossi recently visited and inspected the plant for a second time since the war began. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has called for the “immediate release” of the US national Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was arrested in Russia last week. Stoltenberg, speaking at a news conference, said he joined the US in their call on Russia to release Gershkovich. He added: His arrest is of concern. It is important to respect freedom of the press, the rights of journalists, and the rights to ask questions and to do their jobs. Therefore, we call on his immediate release. Russian police have been pictured guarding the site of yesterday’s explosion in a cafe in central St Petersburg that killed the prominent pro-war Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky. Tributes have been laid near the scene of the blast, which took place as Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was hosting a discussion with other pro-war commentators at a cafe on the banks of the Neva River in the historic heart of the city. More than 30 people were wounded and 10 of them remain in grave condition from the explosion, according to authorities. Police have arrested a woman, Darya Trepova, whom they have identified as the suspect. Authorities claim she was a supporter of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Belarus has started combat readiness inspections of its armed forces, the defence ministry has said in a statement published on Telegram. The ministry said inspections would determine the capacity of military units to perform at “the highest levels of combat readiness”.

Nato has not seen any changes in Russia’s nuclear posture since Vladimir Putin’s announcement that he would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Stoltenberg says. So far, we haven’t seen any changes in their nuclear posture that requires any change, changing our nuclear posture. Nato’s position on Ukraine’s bid “remains unchanged” and that is that “Ukraine will become a member of the alliance”, Stoltenberg says. The main focus however is to “ensure that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign independent nation in Europe”, he says. So the first and most urgent step is for Kyiv’s allies to sustain and further step up military, lethal, non-lethal and economic support to Ukraine, he says. Nato is also looking into how it can develop a political relationship with Ukraine, and how it can expand its work on more long-term reforms in institutional building, he says. It is extremely important to continue to demonstrate that Nato’s door remains open, as we’ll do tomorrow, when Finland will become a full member. As we do when we finalise the accession process for Sweden hopefully in the near future. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has been speaking at a news conference after the announcement that Finland will officially join the military alliance tomorrow. Finland joining Nato on Tuesday “will be a good day for Finland’s security, for Nordic security and for Nato as a whole”, he says. On the subject of Sweden – which applied to join Nato at the same time as Finland last May but whose membership bid is still being blocked by Turkey – Stoltenberg said the raising of Finland’s flag “is also good for Sweden”. He says he will continue to work on finalising the Swedish accession process. Finland will officially become a member of the Nato military alliance on Tuesday, the Finnish president’s office has said. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, confirmed Finland will join the alliance tomorrow. Germany’s vice chancellor, Robert Habeck, has been pictured arriving in Kyiv for talks in an unannounced visit. A spokesperson for Germany’s energy and economy ministry confirmed the visit, saying Habeck, who also serves as minister for energy and the economy, arrived in the Ukrainian capital early today. Habeck was accompanied by a small business delegation including Siegfried Russwurm, president of the federation of German industries. It is Habeck’s first visit to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion 13 months ago. Habeck said the aim of the talks was to “give Ukraine hope” that the country will be rebuilt after the war. He said the purpose of his visit was to send a clear signal to Kyiv: A signal that we believe it will be victorious, that it will be rebuilt, that there is an interest from Europe not only to support it in times of need, but that Ukraine will also be an economically strong partner in the future. Poland has already delivered the first batch of Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, according to the Polish presidential office’s head of international policy, Marcin Przydacz. Przydacz, in an interview with Polish radio RMF today, said: According to my information, this process has already been completed, i.e., the transfer of this first part. Of course, there will be talks about possible further support. He did not specify how many jets had been transferred. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, last month said Warsaw would hand over the first four MiG-29 to Ukraine. Duda said at the time: We still have a dozen of these [aircraft]. We got them in the early 1990s from the East German army. These are the last years of their operation in accordance with their technical capabilities but are still functional. Kyiv has urged its allies to provide fighter jets to defend its airspace and more effectively counterattack the Russian forces on its territory. So far, only Poland and Slovakia, which approved the transfer of 13 MiG-29 jets, have answered that call. We reported earlier that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is scheduled to visit Poland on Wednesday for talks with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. We have some more details of the visit. Zelenskiy will be accompanied by his wife, Olena Zelenska, during his first official visit to Warsaw since Russia’s invasion 13 months ago. He has held a number of secret working meetings in the country while travelling to other countries. The visit will begin with an official meeting at the royal castle between Zelenskiy and Duda, with the pair expected to discuss security issues, regional politics, and economic cooperation, as well as the transit of Ukrainian grain and other farm produce through Poland, according to Marcin Przydacz, the head of Duda’s international office. The talks with be followed by a meeting with the public, according to Duda’s office. Zelenskiy is also expected to hold talks with Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, regarding regional security, the situation at the front, and bilateral cooperation including the situation at border crossings and with Ukrainian grain, according to Morawiecki aide Michal Dworczyk. Ukraine has said Russian forces are “very far” from capturing the eastern town of Bakhmut and that fighting raged around the city administration building where the Wagner mercenary group claims to have raised the Russian flag. “Bakhmut is Ukrainian, and they have not captured anything and are very far from doing that to put it mildly,” Serhiy Cherevatiy, a spokesperson for the eastern military command said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said overnight the fighting in Bakhmut, the heavily fought over city in Ukraine’s Donbas region, is “especially hot”. His comments came as the Wagner founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his troops had raised a Russian flag on the city’s administrative building. However there was no indication from Ukrainian officials that Bakhmut had fallen into Russian hands and Prigozhin has previously made claims about Wagner’s military progress in the city that were premature. Russian police have arrested a woman suspected of delivering a bomb that killed a prominent pro-war Russian military blogger in a blast in a cafe in central St Petersburg on Sunday. Russian authorities say Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was killed by a bomb explosion as he was hosting a discussion with other pro-war commentators at a cafe on the banks of the Neva River in the historic heart of St Petersburg. Russian police said they had identified a woman called Darya Trepova as the suspect, adding that she was arrested in an apartment in St Petersburg after a search on Monday morning. Sources in the country’s interior ministry told the RBK news outlet that the attack was “carefully planned in advance by several people”. Russian tactical nuclear weapons will be moved close to Belarus’ borders with its Nato neighbours, the Russian ambassador to Belarus has said amid tensions between Russia and the west over Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that in the last 24 hours “the Russian army carried out 29 strikes on 12 populated areas of Donetsk region”. It adds “46 residential buildings, a kindergarten, an administrative building, factory workshops, power lines, gas pipelines and cars were destroyed and damaged.” The Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting an explosion in occupied Melitopol. It reports the city administration said a car was blown up in the city centre, and that one person was injured. The Telegram channel of the Russian-imposed authority in the city has named the injured person as Maxim Zubarev, the head of the occupying authority in the Yakymivka settlement in the region. Germany’s vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, has arrived in Ukraine on a surprise visit, the German energy and economy ministry has said, in his first trip to the country since the outbreak of war. Poland’s president has said he expects Zelenskiy, to visit on 5 April. The visit would coincide with the next summit of Nato foreign ministers, which is taking place in Brussels, and which the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is expected to attend. Russia’s security forces are confiscating the passports of senior officials and state company executives due to paranoia over potential leaks and defections, the Financial Times is reporting. Russia plans to form a division of special-purpose submarines that will carry Poseidon nuclear-capable torpedoes as part of the country’s Pacific Fleet by the end of 2024 or first half of 2025, Russia’s Tass news agency has reported. Our video team have also put together this report on the death of Vladlen Tatarsky at the weekend. Pjotr Sauer rounds up the latest developments after Sunday’s St Petersburg café explosion: Russian police have arrested a woman suspected of delivering a bomb that killed a prominent pro-war Russian military blogger in a blast in a cafe in central St Petersburg on Sunday. Russian authorities say Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was killed by a bomb blast as he was hosting a discussion with other pro-war commentators at a cafe on the banks of the Neva River in the historic heart of St Petersburg. Russian news reports said the bomb was hidden in a bust of the blogger that the suspect had given to him as a gift moments before the explosion, which also wounded more than 30 people. Russian police said they had identified a woman called Darya Trepova as the suspect, adding that she was arrested in an apartment in St Petersburg following a search on Monday morning. Sources in the country’s interior ministry told the RBK news outlet that the attack was “carefully planned in advance by several people”. Tatarsky, who had more than 560,000 followers on Telegram, was one of the country’s most influential military bloggers. He emerged as one of the loudest critics of Russia’s defence ministry over the last year for its inability to achieve military gains in Ukraine, and frequently travelled with Russian troops on the frontlines. In one instance he called for a tribunal for the Russian military leadership, describing Moscow’s top officers as “untrained idiots”. He was also among the attendees at a Kremlin ceremony last September where Vladimir Putin proclaimed Russia’s annexation of four partly occupied regions of Ukraine, a move widely condemned by the international community.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said overnight the fighting in Bakhmut, the heavily fought over city in Ukraine’s Donbas region, is “especially hot”. “I am grateful to our warriors who are fighting near Avdiivka, Maryinka, near Bakhmut … Especially Bakhmut! It’s especially hot there today!” he said in his nightly address without elaborating further. His comments came as Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin said his troops had raised a Russian flag on the city’s administrative building. However there was no indication from Ukrainian officials that Bakhmut had fallen into Russian hands and Prigozhin has previously made claims about Wagner’s military progress in the city that were premature. Russian forces have for months been trying to encircle and capture Bakhmut, a town of 70,000 before the Russian invasion launched over a year ago. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that in the last 24 hours “the Russian army carried out 29 strikes on 12 populated areas of Donetsk region”. It adds “46 residential buildings, a kindergarten, an administrative building, factory workshops, power lines, gas pipelines and cars were destroyed and damaged.” The claims have not been independently verified. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports that the suspect in the explosion that killed military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky has been detained by the authorities. She has been named as Daria Trepova. Tass quotes a statement from employees of the investigative committee which says: On suspicion of involvement in the explosion in a cafe in St Petersburg, employees of the Russian investigative committee, together with operational services, detained Daria Trepova. Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, had more than 560,000 followers on Telegram and was one of the country’s most influential military bloggers. More than 30 people were wounded in the blast on Sunday. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that in the last 24 hours, Russian forces have shelled 16 settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region. Zaporizhzhia is one of the partially occupied areas of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Russia’s interior ministry on Monday named a woman called Darya Trepova as a suspect in the killing of prominent war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in a St Petersburg cafe and placed her on its wanted list, Reuters reports, citing Interfax. The Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting an explosion in occupied Melitopol.

The Telegram channel of the Russian-imposed authority in the city has named the injured person as Maxim Zubarev, the head of the occupying authority in the Yakymivka settlement in the region. This is unconfirmed. Video circulating on social media appears to show a damaged car in the street. The claims have not been independently verified.

In case you missed it, the Guardian reporters Shaun Walker, Pjotr Sauer and Tom Phillips have the story of a pair of highly unusual Russian spies who left emotional devastation in their wake when they fled back to Russia earlier this year, amid fears they were about to be unmasked. Gerhard Daniel Campos Wittich managed 3D printing companies in Brazil, which among other things produced novelty resin sculptures for the Brazilian military and sausage dog key chains. His alleged wife, Irina Romanova, posed as a Greek-Mexican photographer named Maria Tsalla and ran a knitting supplies shop in Athens. Here’s an excerpt: Illegals often work in pairs as married couples, but the case of Campos Wittich and Tsalla is the first alleged example of two halves of an illegal couple working in separate countries with separate lives. “We have very little doubt that they were married,” said the Greek official, adding that it was an unusual case. He claimed that the pair had engineered meetings in Greece, Cyprus and France in recent times, possibly romantic encounters mixed with espionage catch-ups. Interviews in Greece and Brazil suggest both halves of the couple left emotional devastation in the wake of their hurried departures. Both had long-term romantic partners in their cover identities, who had no suspicion they were involved with Russian spies. Campos Wittich lived for at least two years in Rio with his Brazilian girlfriend, who coordinated the social media search for him when he disappeared. She is a veterinarian who works for the country’s ministry of agriculture. Read on here: Russia plans to form a division of special-purpose submarines that will carry Poseidon nuclear-capable torpedoes as part of the country’s Pacific Fleet by the end of 2024 or first half of 2025, Russia’s Tass news agency has reported. Russia said in January that it had produced the first set of the Poseidon torpedoes, four years after president Vladimir Putin announced the fundamentally new type of strategic nuclear weapon, confirming it would have its own nuclear power supply, according to Reuters. In late March, Russia said that the coastal infrastructure for the submarines that would carry the Poseidon torpedoes will be finished on the Kamchatka Peninsula, where Russia’s Pacific Fleet’s ballistic nuclear missile submarine base is located. “The decision to form a division of special-purpose nuclear submarines in Kamchatka has been made,” Tass cited an unidentified defence source as saying. “We are talking about December 2024 or the first half of 2025.” There are few confirmed details about the Poseidon in the public domain, but military analysts say it is essentially a cross between a torpedo and a drone which can be launched from a nuclear submarine. Russia’s security forces are confiscating the passports of senior officials and state company executives due to paranoia over potential leaks and defections, the Financial Times is reporting. Citing several people familiar with the matter, the paper’s Moscow bureau chief Max Seddon writes in a paywalled report: The increased pressure reflects deep suspicion in the Kremlin and FSB, the KGB’s successor agency, about the loyalty of Russia’s civilian elite, many of whom privately oppose the war in Ukraine and are chafing over its impact on their lifestyles. A spokesperson for Putin confirmed that Russia had tightened its restrictions on foreign travel for some people workers in “sensitive” areas. The assassination of prominent pro-war Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, may reveal further fractures within the Kremlin and its inner circle, the US-based Institute for the Study of War has written in its daily analysis. The Russian Foreign Ministry blamed Kyiv for the attack – which took place in a St Petersburg cafe reportedly belonging to Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin – and praised Russian military bloggers for their war coverage, “seemingly ignoring the fact that Fomin and other milbloggers routinely criticize the Russian Ministry of Defense and the Russian Foreign Ministry,” ISW analysts wrote. They also noted that Prigozhin stated on 2 April that he would not “blame the Kyiv regime” for the deaths of Fomin and Russian ultranationalist figure Daria Dugina, who was assassinated in August, suggesting that Ukrainian agents were not in fact responsible. The ISW continued: Fomin’s assassination at Prigozhin’s bar is likely part of a larger pattern of escalating Russian internal conflicts involving Prigozhin and Wagner. Fomin had attended another event earlier in the day without incident, so it appears that the attack was deliberately staged in a space owned by Prigozhin. Advisor to Ukrainian Presidential Office Mykhailo Podolyak stated that Fomin’s death was a result of antifighting and political competition among Russian actors. Some Russian political analysts also speculated that Prigozhin was supposed to attend Fomin’s event, although there is no confirmation of that speculation. Fomin’s assassination may have been intended as a warning to Prigozhin, who has been increasingly questioning core Kremlin talking points about the war in Ukraine and even obliquely signaling an interest in the Russian presidency, whether in competition with Putin or as his successor.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the fighting in Bakhmut, the heavily fought over city in Ukraine’s Donbas region, is “especially hot”. “I am grateful to our warriors who are fighting near Avdiivka, Maryinka, near Bakhmut... Especially Bakhmut! It’s especially hot there today!” he said in his nightly address without elaborating further. His comments came as Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin said his troops had raised a Russian flag on the city’s administrative building, according to Reuters. However there was no indication from Ukrainian officials that Bakhmut had fallen into Russian hands and Prigozhin has previously made claims about Wagner’s military progress in the city that were premature. Russian forces have for months been trying to encircle and capture Bakhmut, a town of 70,000 before the Russian invasion launched over a year ago. Prigozhin, in an audio message posted on his press service’s Telegram account, said: From a legal point of view, Bakhmut has been taken. The enemy is concentrated in the western parts.” A senior Ukrainian official had earlier described the situation around the town as “tense,” with the military command carefully considering every move. Deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces were continuing to defend their positions, with Russian forces paying scant attention to their losses as they mounted attacks. The situation in Bakhmut remains tense,” Maliar said on Telegram. “But every military decision and every step is weighed carefully ... We respond to the prevailing situation appropriately, taking into account all circumstances, tasks and the principle of military feasibility.” Zelenskiy and military commanders agreed last month to maintain the defence of Bakhmut amid public debate over whether it was best to remain or adopt other defensive positions. Russian tactical nuclear weapons will be moved close to Belarus’ borders with its Nato neighbours, the Russian ambassador to Belarus has said amid tensions between Russia and the west over Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Associated Press reports: Ambassador Boris Gryzlov’s comment followed Russian president Vladimir Putin’s recent statement about plans to station tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Russia’s neighbour and ally. The announcement marked another attempt by the Russian leader to dangle the nuclear threat to discourage the west from supporting Ukraine. Putin has said that construction of storage facilities for tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus will be complete by 1 July and added that Russia has helped modernise Belarusian warplanes to make them capable of carrying nuclear weapons. The two neighbours have an agreement envisioning close economic, political and military ties. Russia used Belarusian territory as a staging ground for invading Ukraine and has maintained a contingent of troops and weapons there. Gryzlov, speaking in remarks broadcast late Sunday by Belarusian state television, said the Russian nuclear weapons will be “moved up close to the western border of our union state” but did not give any precise location. “It will expand our defence capability, and it will be done regardless of all the noise in Europe and the United States,” he said in a reference to western criticism of Putin’s decision. Belarus shares a 1,250-kilometre border with Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Tactical nuclear weapons, which are intended to destroy enemy troops and weapons on the battlefield, have a relatively short range and a much lower yield compared with nuclear warheads fitted to long-range strategic missiles that are capable of obliterating whole cities. The deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus would put them closer to potential targets in Ukraine and Nato members in Eastern and Central Europe. Belarus’ authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko said Friday that some of Russia’s strategic nuclear weapons might be deployed to Belarus along with part of Russia’s tactical nuclear arsenal. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Livingstone and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments as they happen. Our top story this morning: Russia’s ambassador to Belarus says Moscow will deploy tactical nuclear weapons close to Belarus’s border with Nato neighbours Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The comment follows Russian president Vladimir Putin’s recent statement about plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. The weapons “will be moved to the western border of our union state and will increase the possibilities to ensure security”, Boris Gryzlov told Belarusian state television. “This will be done despite the noise in Europe and the United States.” We’ll have more on this stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Prominent pro-war Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky has been killed in a blast at a cafe in central St Petersburg, Russia’s interior ministry has said. Russian media said a bomb was hidden in a statue presented to Tatarsky in a box as a gift. Another 30 people were injured. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has called for Russia to free the detained American journalist Evan Gershkovich in a rare phone call with his Moscow counterpart. The American’s plea was rejected by Sergei Lavrov, who responded by saying that US officials and media outlets must “not make a fuss” or try to politicise the plight of the Wall Street Journal reporter. More than three dozen editors of news organisations from across the world have signed a letter condemning Gershkovich’s detention. “Russia is sending the message that journalism within your borders is criminalized and that foreign correspondents seeking to report from Russia do not enjoy the benefits of the rule of law,” says the letter. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the heavily fought over city of Bakhmut is “especially hot” right now. The comment, in his regular evening address, came as the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said that his forces had raised the Russian flag over Bakhmut’s administration building. Prigozhin has issued some premature success claims before and the Guardian could not verify his claim. Saudi Arabia and other Opec+ oil producers including Russia have announced further cuts in their production amounting to around 1.16 million barrels per day in a surprise move that analysts said would cause an immediate rise in prices. Russia has suffered up to 200,000 casualties in the war in Ukraine but a “significant number” of these are due to “non-combat causes”, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. “Other leading causes of non-combat casualties likely include poor weapon handing drills, road traffic accidents and climatic injuries such as hypothermia,” it said. Russia plans to form a division of special-purpose submarines that will carry Poseidon nuclear-capable torpedoes as part of the country’s Pacific Fleet by the end of 2024 or first half of 2025, Russia’s Tass news agency has reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/15/russia-ukraine-war-moscows-forces-attempt-advance-in-donetsk-putin-vows-to-expand-relations-with-north-korea-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T18:00:34Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Moscow’s forces attempt advance in Donetsk; Putin vows to expand relations with North Korea – live ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/15/russia-ukraine-war-moscows-forces-attempt-advance-in-donetsk-putin-vows-to-expand-relations-with-north-korea-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/15/russia-ukraine-war-moscows-forces-attempt-advance-in-donetsk-putin-vows-to-expand-relations-with-north-korea-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: at least three people die in Donetsk shelling; Kyiv mayor warns of cold winter due to gas shortages – as it happened","bodyText":"It is just after 9pm in Ukraine. Here are some things you might’ve missed: At least three civilians have been killed in Russian shelling in the eastern region of Donetsk. Thirteen were wounded in artillery barrages from the Russian military, Ukrainian officials said on Monday. Ukraine says it has struck a base used by the Wagner paramilitary group, according to reports. A bridge near the occupied city of Melitopol was also hit, according to reports from AFP. Five people have been injured in Kharkiv after Russian shelling. Two of them in a serious condition, a top Ukrainian official has said. Putin says Russia is ready to offer allies in Latin American, Asia and Africa ‘advanced’ weapons. The UN has said it can facilitate an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visit to Ukraine’s damaged Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant if both Russia and Ukraine agree. A total of 42 countries have called on Russia to immediately withdraw military forces from the plant, including the US, Japan and the UK, plus the EU. The IAEA has warned of a possible nuclear disaster unless fighting stops. On Poland’s Armed Forces Day on Monday, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief Valeriy Zaluzhnyi released a video statement commemorating the national holiday. In the video, he says, speaking in Polish, “Today, just like 102 years ago, we once again face a centuries-old enemy together” The holiday celebrates the anniversary of the 1920 victory over Soviet Russia at the Battle of Warsaw. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, says Russia and North Korea will expand bilateral relations. Pyongyang’s state media reported on Monday. Putin told North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that the two countries would “expand the comprehensive and constructive bilateral relations with common efforts”, Pyongyang’s state media reported on Monday. In a letter to Kim for North Korea’s liberation day, Putin said that closer ties would be in both countries’ interests, and would help strengthen the security and stability of the Korean peninsula and the north-eastern Asian region, North Korea’s KCNA news agency said. Kyiv Mayor warns of a cold winter for citizens, due to gas shortages. Former boxing champion and mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko said he did not want to reassure residents that “everything will be fine” and that there were “harsh realities” in the country. That is all from us today. Thanks for reading along, we will be back with the latest Ukraine news tomorrow. The UN has said it can facilitate IAEA visit to power plant if Russia and Ukraine agree. The United Nations has the logistics and security capacity to support a visit by International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant if both Russia and Ukraine agree, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Monday. The plant, built in the Soviet era, is the largest nuclear reactor in Europe and was damaged by Russian shelling in early August. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has accused the Russians of using the plant as a “nuclear shield”. Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, described the ongoing crisis of safety oversight as a dire threat to public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond, describing the situation as “completely out of control.” “You have a catalogue of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,” he said. While Grossi has suggested a mission to the plant, Ukraine has been blocking the initiative, arguing as recently as June that any visit would legitimise Russia’s presence there. Five foreign nationals captured fighting with Ukrainian forces have been charged with being mercenaries on Monday, with three facing the death penalty, Russian media has reported. The trial was carried out by a Russian-backed separatist court in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk. U.K. national John Harding, Croatian Vjekoslav Prebeg and Swedish citizen Mathias Gustafsson, who were captured in and around the port city of Mariupol, face a possible death sentence, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported. TASS cited the judge as saying that the trial would resume in early October, according to reports from Reuters. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz questioned the Russian tourist ban, following a meeting with leaders of the Nordic countries in Oslo on Monday. “What is important for us is that we understand there are a lot of people fleeing from Russia because they disagree with the Russian regime,” he said. “All the decisions we take should not make it more complicated to leave the country, for getting away from the leadership and the dictatorship in Russia,” he added. Finland’s Prime Minister Sanna Marin who was also at the meeting, has called for Russian tourists to be banned from the EU to ensure that they too pay a penalty for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny says he is in solitary confinement. In a Twitter thread posted on Monday, Navalny said he had been placed in a ‘special housing unit’ following his efforts to create a labour union in jail. Navalny had been serving two-and-a-half years for violating parole on old fraud charges but in March 2022, his jail time was extended to nine years after he was found guilty of embezzlement. Navalny and his allies say the charges are politically motivated. In 2020, Navalny narrowly survived a poisoning attack with Novichok, a Soviet-designed military-grade nerve agent. He has accused Russian authorities, but the Kremlin has denied any involvement. Ukraine on Monday said it had struck a base used by a Russian paramilitary group as well as a bridge near the occupied city of Melitopol, according to reports from AFP. Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine, told AFP the strike was aimed at a base of the Wagner group. The Guardian hasn’t been able to independently verify this report. Wagner, Russia’s private military contractor, was established in 2014 to support pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. The US and others say it is funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a powerful businessman closely linked to Vladimir Putin who is under western sanctions. Prigozhin denies any links to the group. My colleague Pjotr Sauer wrote a piece about the Wagner group’s involvement in Russia’s war with Ukraine, read it here: Russia’s private military contractor Wagner comes out of the shadows in Ukraine war Gen Darryl Williams, the new commanding general of United States Army Europe and Africa, attended the ceremony in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Solider in downtown Warsaw. Williams told the Associated Press that the US presence was meant to deliver a message of “strength and resilience”. “It is about deterrence, about being strong, Nato is strong, the Polish people are strong, and we are standing shoulder to shoulder with them,” he said. “Today, just like 102 years ago, we once again face a centuries-old enemy together” Ukraine’s commander-in-chief said in a statement on Poland’s annual Armed Forces Day. Poland celebrated on Monday its annual Armed Forces Day, a national holiday commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over Soviet Russia at the Battle of Warsaw. Speaking Polish, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, greeted the Polish military, saying: On behalf of the Armed Forces and in my own name, I congratulate you on the occasion of the Polish Armed Forces Day. In the Battle of Warsaw, your people defended their statehood and saved Europe from the Bolshevik invasion. Poland’s ally in that war was the Ukrainian People’s Republic. Today, just like 102 years ago, we are once again facing a centuries-old enemy together. I am deeply grateful to the Polish people for their help and support in this difficult time. We are fighting for our freedom and yours. Together we will win. According to UN figures from May, more than 3.5 million Ukrainians have fled to Poland since the Russian invasion began. At least three Ukrainian civilians have been killed and 13 wounded in artillery barrages from the Russian military in the eastern region of Donetsk, Ukrainian officials said on Monday. The barrage has damaged dozens of residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, reports Reuters. The eastern region of Donetsk – one of the two provinces making up the country’s industrial heartland of Donbas that has been the focus of a Russian offensive – has faced the most intense shelling. Regional officials said at least three people died and a further 13 were wounded by Russian shelling that hit numerous towns and villages in the Donetsk region during the last 24 hours. Russia will do “everything necessary” to allow specialists from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, a top Russian official said on Monday. In a statement reported by Reuters on Monday foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: In close cooperation with the Agency and its leadership, we will do everything necessary for the IAEA specialists to be at the station and give a truthful assessment of the destructive actions of the Ukrainian side. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the biggest in Europe, was captured by Russia during its invasion of Ukraine and has since been the source of intense fighting between the two sides. Both Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of risking a nuclear accident. The head of the IAEA, Rafael Mariano Grossi, previously described the situation as “completely out of control” and suggested a mission to the plant. However, this was blocked by Energoatom – Ukraine’s nuclear power plant operator – who thought any visit could legitimise Russia’s occupation of the area. My colleague Peter Beaumont wrote a piece about the issues at the nuclear plant, read it here: How dangerous is the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant? Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Moscow valued its ties with countries in Latin American, Asia and Africa and was ready to offer modern weapons to its allies, reports Reuters. Putin used a speech at an arms show near Moscow to boast of Russia’s advanced weapons capabilities and declare its willingness to share technology with like-minded countries. Putin told the the opening ceremony of the “Army-2022” forum near Moscow: (We) are ready to offer our allies the most modern types of weapons, from small arms to armoured vehicles and artillery to combat aviation and unmanned aerial vehicles. Almost all of them have been used more than once in real combat operations. The Russian president’s comments come just a day after he offered to expand relations with North Korea. In a letter to Kim Jong-un for Korea‘s liberation day, Putin said closer ties would be in both countries’ interests, and would help strengthen the security and stability of the Korean peninsula and the north-east Asian region, North Korea‘s KCNA news agency said. Russian soldiers are taking their families out of Melitopol, according to the BBC’s Russian service. The broadcaster reports the city’s mayor, Ivan Fedorov, saying: After the partisans and the armed forces of Ukraine have actively worked for another week, the Russian military is taking their families out of the city.” It comes after authorities in Kherson reportedly said on Sunday that some Russian commanders had left the city. Andrew Roth has the latest on Brittney Griner’s appeal against her nine-year jail sentence: Lawyers for American basketball star Brittney Griner have filed an appeal against her nine-year prison sentence for drug possession. Griner, a centre for the Phoenix Mercury who had been playing in Yekaterinburg during the WNBA off-season, was arrested in February at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport after vape canisters containing cannabis oil were found in her luggage. She was convicted on 4 August. Lawyer Maria Blagovolina said on Monday the appeal had been filed, but declined to give details. Alexander Boykov, a lawyer at Moscow Legal Centre who represented Griner in court, told Reuters the appeal would be mainly based on alleged violations in the course of the investigation. Griner’s defence team argued in court that some of her case files had been drawn up without being translated for her into English. It was not clear how soon an appeal could be heard.

He said there will be gas for people living in the capital and it will not increase in price, but residents needed to be prepared for “different scenarios”. In an interview with Babel, he added: This is the expectation. But we do not rule out that there may be acts of terrorism, attacks on gas stations. We also take this scenario into account. We bought generators, fuel for these generators. First of all, they will go to hospitals, kindergartens and schools. We will do everything possible and impossible, which depends on us, to keep the houses warm. He urged Ukrainians living in Kyiv to prepare warm blankets and clothes at home and to be prepared for temperatures to be lower than normal, at around 18-19C. These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. Shelling in Kharkiv, a city in north-west Ukraine, has left five people injured, with two of them in a serious condition, a top Ukrainian official has said. Posting on Telegram, the head of the Kharkiv regional state administration Oleg Synegubov, said: As a result of the morning shelling of Kharkiv, 5 people were injured. According to the information of the Regional Center of Emergency Medical Assistance, 4 people were hospitalized, 2 of them are in serious condition. 1 person was treated on the spot. Medical and rescue services continue to work at the sites of the hits. It is just after 1pm in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Ukrainian forces reported heavy Russian shelling and attempts to advance on several towns in the eastern region of Donetsk that has become a key focus of the near six-month war, but said they had repelled many of the attacks. Ukraine’s military command said on Sunday that Russian soldiers had continued unsuccessfully to attack Ukrainian positions near Avdiivka, which, since 2014, has become one of the outposts of Ukrainian forces near Donetsk. Russia is probably in the advanced planning stages to hold a referendum for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) to join Russia, according to British intelligence. On 11 August, Russian media reported that the Moscow-installed administrative head, Denis Pushilin, said that the date of a referendum on the DPR joining Russia would be announced after the DPR’s “complete liberation”. However, it is unclear if the final decision to go ahead with a vote has yet been taken, the UK’s Ministry of Defence reports. Mykolaiv came under sustained overnight fire from Russian forces, a Ukrainian official has said. Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, posted on his Telegram account that an educational facility and hotel had been struck on the outskirts of the city. He added there were no casualties. The defence team of US basketball star Brittney Griner has appealed against her conviction for drugs possession and trafficking, Griner’s lawyer Maria Blagovolina told Reuters on Monday. Griner, who had played for a Russian club, was arrested at a Moscow airport on 17 February after cannabis-infused vape cartridges were found in her luggage. She pleaded guilty to the charges but said she had made an “honest mistake” by entering Russia with cannabis oil, which is illegal in the country. She was convicted on 4 August and jailed for nine years. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, says Russia and North Korea will expand bilateral relations, Pyongyang’s state media reported on Monday. Putin told North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that the two countries would “expand the comprehensive and constructive bilateral relations with common efforts”, Pyongyang’s state media reported on Monday. In a letter to Kim for North Korea’s liberation day, Putin said that closer ties would be in both countries’ interests, and would help strengthen the security and stability of the Korean peninsula and the north-eastern Asian region, North Korea’s KCNA news agency said. The first UN ship to carry Ukrainian grain for Africa is ready to depart with 23,000 tonnes of wheat. The MV Brave Commander will head to Africa and “Ethiopia will be the last country where the 23,000-tonne cargo of wheat will be delivered”, said Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov. It will be the first shipment of food aid since Kyiv and Moscow agreed a deal brokered by the UN and Turkey in July to unblock Black Sea grain deliveries. The first ship to depart Ukraine when grain exports resumed was approaching the Syrian port of Tartus on Sunday. The ship left Ukraine two weeks ago but cargo on the Razoni was refused by its original Lebanese buyer, two shipping sources told Reuters. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his forces will target Russian soldiers who shoot at or from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. “Every Russian soldier who either shoots at the plant, or shoots using the plant as cover, must understand that he becomes a special target for our intelligence agents, for our special services, for our army,” he said. A total of 42 countries have called on Russia to immediately withdraw military forces from the plant, including the US, Japan and the UK, plus the EU. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned of a possible nuclear disaster unless fighting stops. Zelenskiy has warned those with Russian citizenship against being complicit and silent in supporting Putin’s war on Ukraine. “People’s silence approaches the level of complicity. And the rejection of the real fight against evil becomes the assistance to it. Therefore, if you have Russian citizenship and you are silent, it means that you are not fighting, it means that you are supporting it,” he said in his latest national address. Ukraine’s forces continued to strike at strategic bridges supplying Russian troops holding the city of Kherson, the only major site held by the invaders on the west bank of the Dnieper, including the Antonovsky road bridge and the crossing at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant upstream. Ukraine said Russian troops who crossed the Dnieper River during their offensive in the southern region were facing growing difficulties after bridges were damaged. Russia says it has taken control of Udy, a village in the eastern Kharkiv region, according to its latest military briefing. The village has been under heavy shelling by Russian forces. Russia’s priority over the past week has likely been to reorient units to strengthen its campaign in southern Ukraine, British military intelligence said on Sunday. The UK Ministry of Defence said Russia also appeared to be intensifying attacks on the eastern Donbas front, in what is likely to be an attempt to ensure Ukraine is not able to concentrate forces in the south against Kherson. Countries throughout Europe have called for the EU to limit or block short-term Schengen visas for Russian citizens. Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Finland and the Czech Republic all urged new restrictions. Poland is also considering restrictions for Russian tourist visas. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has published its latest map showing Russian military attack and troop locations in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to target Russian troops at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant who fire on Ukrainian towns and cities. In a video statement on Saturday evening, Ukraine’s president said: Every Russian soldier who either shoots at the station or shoots under the cover of the station must understand that they are becoming a special target for our intelligence, for our special services, for our army. Both Ukraine and Russia have accused one another of shelling the nuclear plant, which is the largest in Europe, following multiple incidents in recent weeks. Russian troops captured the station early in the war. G7 nations have called on Moscow to withdraw from the plant to avoid risking nuclear catastrophe. The defence team of US basketball star Brittney Griner has appealed against her conviction for narcotics possession and trafficking, Griner’s lawyer Maria Blagovolina told Reuters on Monday. Griner, who had played for a Russian club, was arrested at a Moscow airport on 17 February after cannabis-infused vape cartridges were found in her luggage. She pleaded guilty to the charges but said she had made an “honest mistake” by entering Russia with cannabis oil, which is illegal in the country. She was convicted on 4 August and jailed for nine years. The US government says Griner was wrongfully detained. It has offered to exchange her for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year prison sentence in the US.

The report could not been independently verified. Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer report: “A city with a Russian history,” proclaim billboards across the Ukrainian city of Kherson, occupied by the Russian army since the first days of March. Others display the Russian flag, or quotes from Vladimir Putin. Over the past five months, Moscow has appointed an occupation administration to run the Kherson region and ordered schools to teach the Russian curriculum. Local people are encouraged to apply for Russian passports to access pensions and other benefits. The next stage of the Kremlin’s plan is a referendum, to add a dubious sense of legality to these facts on the ground, and create a pretext for bringing Kherson and other occupied parts of southern Ukraine into Russia, using an updated version of the 2014 Crimea playbook. In a series of telephone interviews, people in Kherson reported minimal enthusiasm for a referendum, and described a nervous, unpredictable atmosphere in the city. Residents remain unsure about what the next few months might bring: a swift Ukrainian counteroffensive to regain control, a protracted battle that turns the city to rubble, or Russia carrying out its sham referendum and annexing the territory. Read more here: ‘A referendum is not right’: occupied Kherson looks to uncertain future These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent is reporting that Russian forces shelled Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine, overnight and hit a factory. No further information was given about possible casualties. Simon Tisdall argues locking up Vladimir Putin is a strategic aim the west should pursue: The west’s strategic aims in Ukraine – to repulse Russia’s invasion, restore national sovereignty and score a victory for global democracy over “the forces of darkness” – were clearly set out by US president Joe Biden in Warsaw in March and subsequently endorsed by UK and European leaders. What has always been less clear is whether they honestly expect to achieve these aims, given Nato’s less than heroic refusal to get directly involved. An uncomfortable, even distressing question now arises: should Ukrainians prepare for a stab in the back this winter? Nearly six months into the war, the widening gap between rhetoric and reality grows potentially fatal. Public outrage over the invasion is giving way to concern, bordering on panic, about its alarming knock-on effects on energy and food prices and the cost of living. That in turn is feeding doubts about western staying power. How long before Europe’s already shaky unity crumbles, if and when Russia’s gas tap is finally turned off? Read more of Simon Tisdall’s piece here: As Putin’s war spreads panic across Europe, Ukrainians must fear a stab in the back Russian troops are using Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, as cover to fire missiles into Ukraine-held territory. Guardian foreign correspondent Luke Harding talks to residents and Ukrainian military officials, who say they cannot retaliate. The Philippines is looking to buy heavy-lift Chinook helicopters from the US, after scrapping a deal with Russia worth 12.7bn pesos ($227.35m) in order to avoid sanctions, Manila’s ambassador to Washington said on Monday. In June, days before President Rodrigo Duterte ended his six-year term, the Philippines scrapped a deal to buy 16 Mi-17 Russian military transport helicopters because of fears of US sanctions linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, reports Reuters. Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez told journalists in a virtual forum. This cancellation of this contract is precipitated mainly by the war in Ukraine. While there are sanctions expected to come our way, from the United States and western countries, obviously it is not in our interest to continue and pursue this contract. Romualdez said the Chinooks would replace existing hardware used for the movement of troops and in disaster preparedness in the Southeast Asian country. The US is willing to strike a deal for the amount the Philippines was set to spend on the Russian helicopters, Romualdez said, adding the deal with Washington will likely include maintenance, service and parts. The Philippines is pursuing discussions with Russia to recover its $38m down payment for the helicopters, the delivery of which was supposed to start in November next year, or 24 months after the contract was signed. Rustem Umerov, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, posted a picture of the Canadian military on Twitter and thanked them for helping train members of the Ukrainian armed forces. Another six ships have received permission to pass through the maritime humanitarian corridor in the Black Sea, according to a statement released by the UN-backed Joint Coordination Centre (JCC). Two of the vessels, MV Kafkam Etler and MV Zelek Star, have reportedly already passed inspection in the Sea of Marmara and can go to Chornomorsk, Odesa, for loading. The inspection of the remaining four vessels – MV Great Arsenal, MV Zumrut Ana, MV Ocean S, MV Kubrosliy – is scheduled for Tuesday. If the inspection is successful, the ships are set to go to Chornomorsk, according to Ukrainian media reports. The shipments are part of a deal brokered by the UN and Turkey with Kyiv and Moscow in July to unblock Black Sea grain deliveries. Russian proxies are continuing to consolidate administrative control of occupied areas by enforcing payments in rubles, according to a recent report from the institute for the study of war. The US thinktank cited Ukraine’s main intelligence directorate (GUR) as saying that Moscow-installed authorities in the occupied city of Kherson are pressuring local ambulance workers to sign forms consenting to work for the new occupation government and receive payments in rubles. Russian occupation authorities are also reportedly continuing to collect personal passport data from recipients of humanitarian aid, civilians who contact the occupying forces’ government, and customers of Russian mobile phone services. Russia is probably in the advanced planning stages to hold a referendum for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) to join Russia, according to British intelligence.

Ukraine’s military command said on Sunday that Russian soldiers had continued unsuccessfully to attack Ukrainian positions near Avdiivka, which, since 2014, has become one of the outposts of Ukrainian forces near Donetsk. Ukraine’s military command said “fierce fighting” had continued in Pisky, an eastern village that Russia had earlier in the day said it had under full control. “The occupiers are trying to break through the defence of our troops in the directions of Oleksandropol, Krasnohorivka, Avdiivka, Maryinka, and Pisky,” Ukraine’s general staff said in its nightly briefing. “Fierce fighting continues.” Oleg Zhdanov, a Ukrainian military expert, said the situation was particularly difficult in Avdiivka and nearby towns, such as Pisky. “We have insufficient artillery power in place and our forces are asking for more support to defend Pisky,” he said in a video posted online. “But the town is basically under Ukrainian control.” The Guardian could not immediately independently verify the battlefield accounts. Our Wellington-based correspondent, Eva Corlett, brings us this report from New Zealand. The island nation will send another 120 troops to the UK to help train Ukrainian soldiers to defend the country against Russia’s “unjustified invasion”, in its latest show of solidarity. At a press conference on Monday, Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand prime minister, said the extra defence force personnel would take over from 30 New Zealand soldiers deployed in May. It forms part of a wider measures to support Ukraine, including more than NZD$40m in financial support and the sanctioning of 840 people and entities. Ardern said the deployment would enable two teams to train Ukrainian personnel in frontline combat including weapon handling, first aid and operational law. The latest deployment brought the total number of personnel sent to support Ukraine in the war to 224 – comparable to partner nations like Denmark (130) and Sweden (120), Ardern said. We know that one of the highest priorities for Ukraine right now, is to train its soldiers, and New Zealand is proud to stand in solidarity alongside a number of other countries to answer that call.” Training will be conducted exclusively on UK soil until late November, and New Zealand troops will not enter Ukraine. Ardern was pressed on whether she would take up President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s offer to visit Ukraine in person, but said she had no plans to do so. A total of 42 countries have called on Russia to immediately withdraw military forces from Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, including the US, Japan and the UK, plus the EU. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) warned of a possible nuclear disaster unless fighting stops. The statement called the deployment of Russian military personnel and weaponry at the nuclear facility unacceptable in that it “disregards the safety, security, and safeguards principles that all members of the IAEA have committed to respect”. The presence of Russian military forces at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant prevents the operator and the Ukrainian authorities from fulfilling their nuclear and radiation safety obligations in accordance with international conventions and IAEA safety standards, and prevents the IAEA from fulfilling its safeguards mandate. We urge the Russian Federation to immediately withdraw its military forces and all other unauthorised personnel from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, its immediate surroundings, and all of Ukraine so that the operator and the Ukrainian authorities can resume their sovereign responsibilities within Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders and the legitimate operating staff can conduct their duties without outside interference, threat, or unacceptably harsh working conditions.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said his forces will target Russian soldiers who shoot at or from Europe’s largest nuclear power station, amid warnings that the Kremlin may falsely claim Kyiv has directly hit the critical site. Zelenskiy said anyone giving orders for attacks on the site or nearby towns and cities should face trial by an international court, as concern about the safety of the nuclear site remained high. “Every Russian soldier who either shoots at the plant, or shoots using the plant as cover, must understand that he becomes a special target for our intelligence agents, for our special services, for our army,” Zelenskiy said in a video address. He called for new sanctions against Russia that would “necessarily block the Russian nuclear industry”, and he argued that “absolutely all officials of the terrorist state, as well as those who help them in this blackmail operation with the nuclear power plant, must be tried by an international court”. The Russian ambassador in Kabul has said working with the Taliban is necessary where it is in the interests of Moscow. The Taliban, no matter how you treat them, is a reality that cannot be avoided. Therefore, we must work with them where it suits our interests and where it is required to solve the tasks facing Russia,” Dmitry Zhirnov said in an interview with RIA Novosti. Talks were set to begin in Moscow between a delegation of the Afghan ministry of industry and trade sent by the Taliban government and Russian partners, Zhirnov added. Kabul also planned to discuss the supply of oil, grain, sunflower oil. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has said Russia and North Korea will expand bilateral relations, Pyongyang’s state news agency, the KCNA, reported on Monday. Putin told the North Korean ruler, Kim Jong-un, that the two countries would “expand the comprehensive and constructive bilateral relations with common efforts”, the KCNA reported on Monday. In a letter to Kim for North Korea’s liberation day, Putin said closer ties would be in both countries’ interests, and would help strengthen the security and stability of the Korean peninsula and the north-eastern Asian region, the KCNA said. Kim also reportedly sent a letter to Putin saying Russian-North Korean friendship had been forged in the second world war with victory over Japan. Their “strategic and tactical cooperation, support and solidarity” had since reached a new level in their common efforts to frustrate threats and provocations from hostile military forces, Kim said in the letter, as reported by Reuters. KCNA did not identify the hostile forces, but it has typically used that term to refer to the US and its allies. Kim predicted cooperation between Russia and North Korea would grow based on an agreement signed in 2019 when he met with Putin. North Korea in July recognised two Russian-occupied “people’s republics” in eastern Ukraine as independent states, and officials raised the prospect of North Korean workers being sent to the areas to help in construction and other labour.

Saudi Arabia’s largely state-owned energy firm recorded one of the largest quarterly profits in history, highlighting the colossal profits made by gas and oil-rich nations during the energy crisis linked to the war in Ukraine. Saudi Aramco profits in the three months to the end of June were up 90% to $48bn (£40bn) to beat the near $26bn it made a year earlier. Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding invested in Russian energy groups Gazprom, Rosneft and Lukoil between 22 February and 22 March, it said on Twitter on Sunday.

EDF is proposing to deposit mud excavated as part of the huge construction project on the Somerset coast in the waters off the Welsh capital next year. The Welsh parliament debated the issue on Wednesday after 10,000 people signed a petition calling for a full environmental impact assessment (EIA) to be carried out on the proposal. Petitioners, led by the musician Cian Ciarán, of the band Super Furry Animals, fear the mud could be contaminated and may cause environmental damage and harm the health of people who live in south Wales. Ahead of the debate, EDF confirmed it would carry out a full EIA but members of the Welsh parliament, or Senedd Cymru, said it was vital the findings – and the workings – were published in full. Llyr Gruffydd, a Plaid Cymru member of the Senedd, said there were “real concerns” that the dumping may harm marine life and put public health in danger. “Radioactive particles from the outflow pipes of Hinkley Point A and Hinkley Point B have been flushed out for the last 55 years,” he said. “We know there were plutonium leaks in the 1970s that might also have contaminated the mud they want to dump in Welsh waters.” Andrew RT Davies, the Tory shadow health minister in the Senedd, said people had “genuine concerns” about the mud. He said it was important EDF was not allowed to “mark its own homework” and the workings behind its EIA had to be shown. Outside the Senedd chamber, Ciarán expressed concern about the possible scope of the EIA. He said: “Irrespective of the debate, our campaign isn’t going away quietly. The strength of the public’s feeling, as demonstrated by the petition, means that Senedd members, Natural Resources Wales, EDF and Westminster cannot take the Welsh people for granted.” EDF insists that previous testing has shown that the mud it intends to deposit is no different from that found elsewhere in the Bristol Channel and is not classed as radioactive under UK law. But it said that it had listened to concerns raised during a previous drop of mud in 2018 and would carry out the EIA. Chris Fayers, head of environment at Hinkley Point C, said: “For this second phase of dredging, we intend to go further than normal regulatory requirements in order to provide the public with additional reassurance. We have proposed a testing plan that goes above and beyond internationally recognised best practice, with more samples at greater depth and with a greater range of analysis – including tests for pure alpha-emitting particles and tritium. “We also intend to conduct a full environmental impact assessment as part of our disposal licence application. We believe it is right to go beyond technical arguments to provide the necessary public confidence that all concerns have been addressed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/berliners-rally-to-support-ukraine-refugees-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T15:26:02Z","webTitle":"‘Tip of the iceberg’: Berliners rally to welcome refugees from Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/berliners-rally-to-support-ukraine-refugees-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/berliners-rally-to-support-ukraine-refugees-germany","fields":{"headline":"‘Tip of the iceberg’: Berliners rally to welcome refugees from Ukraine","bodyText":"When Iman Abdikarim joined a Telegram group to help Ukrainian refugees on a whim earlier this week, it had only 17 members and only vague ideas of what it might do. By Friday morning, the masters student was directing a chaotic throng of arrivals inside Berlin’s main station, as Germany’s “welcome culture” returned to the foreground. The Telegram group now has almost 8,000 volunteers and is central to efforts to provide refugees with temporary accommodation, food and clothes. “I’ve been working 10 hours every day this week, and I’ve got to work shifts at the clinic at night,” said the 27-year-old with Somali roots in an upbeat tone. “But we are learning what the people who come here need.” Her mobile phone buzzes every few seconds with new messages, some of them from Ukraine, others from more Berliners who want to help. Behind her back, another volunteer coordinator shouts into a megaphone: “If you speak Russian or Ukrainian, stay. If you don’t, please come back tonight.” Scenes at Berlin’s central station mirror those from the summer of 2015, when large parts of German civic society rallied to aid asylum seekers arriving from Syria. In terms of sheer numbers, however, the challenge is starker: at the height of the influx of arrivals in 2015 and 2016, authorities in Berlin had to coordinate shelter for about 700 people and struggled, temporarily repurposing sports halls. This Thursday alone, 6,500 refugees arrived in the city by train, according to Berlin’s senator for social affairs. In each of the previous two days more than 1,000 people have arrived. Operator Deutsche Bahn, which has been handing out free travel tickets to refugees from Ukraine, says it has doubled its number of direct trains to the Polish border. “We have to prepare for the fact that the largest movement of refugees since the end of the second world war is headed for Europe,” said senator Katja Kipping. “What we have seen so far is only the tip of the iceberg.” The hope in Germany’s administrative apparatus is that relaxed visa rules will avoid bottleneck situations: since 2017, Ukrainians with biometric passports have been able to travel to the Schengen zone and stay for 90 days out of every 180 without needing a visa. Sixteen-year-old Viktor Levchenko arrived at Berlin central station on Friday morning, with his mother and cousin, having left Kyiv 48 hours before. Carrying a backpack each and a paper bag with basic supplies such as flour, toilet rolls and soap given to them by volunteers, they waited on the cold ground floor of the station for a Berlin-based Ukrainian friend to pick them up and host them for a few days. “We are working out what to do,” Levchenko said. “For now, we must stay in Germany. But afterwards, we must go back.” After arriving in Berlin, they called his aunt and uncle who had stayed behind in Kyiv to serve in the military. As they were speaking over the phone, they could hear air-raid sirens in the background. Even before Vladimir Putin’s army started its incursion on to Ukrainian soil last week, asylum applications in Germany had risen to a four-year high in 2021, following a drop during the first year of the pandemic. As shelters in the capital were close to full capacity at the start of the year, the senate proposed renting empty hotels and hostels on an ad hoc basis. On Friday, Kipping said the city was planning to erect a tent outside the central station that would provide temporary resting places and sanitary facilities to those arriving from Ukraine before they were transported by shuttle buses to shelters in Berlin or nearby cities like Leipzig. But until now, the brunt of the aid effort has been facilitated by volunteers, such as Mirjam König, who was waiting by the side of arrival point at Hauptbahnhof with her toddler son on her arm. A cardboard sign rested on the buggy next to her, saying: “One room for woman with 1/2 children.” König said she had posted her offer of a room on a volunteering website three days earlier but did not get a response. “Maybe it’s more practical this way,” she said, while bouncing her son in her arms. “I wanted to exhaust all my options.” “If something like this happened to me, I would hope there will be people offering me their help too. When injustice happens on this Earth, you want to do something about it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/29/french-teachers-and-transport-workers-strike-over-pay-and-pension-age","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-29T11:54:30Z","webTitle":"French teachers and transport workers strike over pay and pension age","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/29/french-teachers-and-transport-workers-strike-over-pay-and-pension-age","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/29/french-teachers-and-transport-workers-strike-over-pay-and-pension-age","fields":{"headline":"French teachers and transport workers strike over pay and pension age","bodyText":"Street demonstrations have been held across France as schools and transport services were disrupted by the first major strike since Emmanuel Macron won re-election as president in April. Primary school teachers stopped work on Thursday, as did train and bus drivers on certain regional services and nuclear power industry workers, in what was seen as a test for trade unions’ ability to mobilise support. Workers marched in cities across France as unions pushed for salary increases to address the impact of inflation and rising prices. Unions also called for the scrapping of Macron’s plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65 progressively over several years. The president’s insistence on pushing through changes to the pensions system – one of his main re-election campaign pledges – remains broadly unpopular in polling. It has mobilised leftwing trade unions as well as opposition parties on the left and far right who have threatened to block the government’s path. Ministers said on Thursday that draft legislation on pensions changes would be ready by Christmas, with a consultation process to begin next week. But Macron’s centrist party lost its parliament majority in June elections, which has seriously undermined its ability to push through major legislative changes such as the pensions plan. The labour minister, Olivier Dussopt, said he could not rule out Macron dissolving parliament if opposition parties teamed up to block the government. This would immediately trigger fresh parliament elections. The government is leaning on rightwing politicians from the Les Républicains party to try to gain their support for its pension measures in order to get the bill through. “We are against pushing back the age of retirement because we consider it an aberration when there are so many unemployed people in this country,” Philippe Martinez, the head of the leftwing CGT union, told BFM television. He added: “Wages must be increased as there is a cost of living problem in this country.” Mathilde Panot, the parliamentary leader of the left’s France Unbowed party, tweeted ahead of the strikes: “If the president insists on declaring a social war on the people, we will respond with all the means at our disposal.” The government argues that Macron has approved wage increases for civil servants and teachers and put in place one of Europe’s most generous anti-inflation safety nets that has capped energy prices for households and held down inflation. But unions said wages were still being eroded by inflation and more needed to be done. The promised salary increases for teachers are not expected until late next year, with confusion surrounding which teachers would benefit and by how much. “We can really see that teachers are fed up with their salaries … if on top of that, there’s the issue of pensions, it risks creating some sparks,” said Guislaine David from the Snuipp-FSU union. About one in 10 schools in Paris are expected to shut for the day on Thursday, while 300 will close in the southern Bouches-du-Rhone area which includes Marseille."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2022/mar/04/airbnb-suspends-all-operations-in-russia-and-belarus","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T13:13:59Z","webTitle":"Airbnb suspends all operations in Russia and Belarus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/04/airbnb-suspends-all-operations-in-russia-and-belarus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2022/mar/04/airbnb-suspends-all-operations-in-russia-and-belarus","fields":{"headline":"Airbnb suspends all operations in Russia and Belarus","bodyText":"Airbnb has suspended all operations in Russia and Belarus, and also stopped users of the home rental site from both countries from making any bookings, in the company’s latest response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The home rental firm, which has almost 100,000 short-term rentals available across both countries according to the market research firm AirDNA, has been vocal in its support of Ukraine. Brian Chesky, the co-founder and chief executive of Airbnb, who has added the Ukrainian flag to his Twitter profile, tweeted the suspension in a one-line post. The company elaborated on Chesky’s tweet, adding that the ban would extend to Airbnb members of those countries trying to make any bookings on the site. “This means that we will block calendars from accepting new bookings in both countries until further notice,” said a spokesperson for the company. “We will also restrict users in Belarus and Russia from making new reservations as guests. We certainly hope that as we look to the future, a path to peace is forged.” Russia has more than 93,000 listings on Airbnb, and Belarus almost 4,000, according to AirDNA. On Thursday, Airbnb waived fees for hosts and those booking rentals in Ukraine. It took the decision after members of the public began making bookings in Ukraine with no intention of travelling as a way of providing financial support to residents facing hardship during the invasion. Ukraine has more than 17,000 active short-term rental listings. On Monday, Airbnb pledged to offer free housing to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. The company has said it has received “overwhelming support” for the initiative, with more than 260,000 visitors so far to a dedicated web page where it is possible to sign up to be a host or to donate. Earlier this week, Chesky said the company was assessing its options regarding its Russian operation. “We don’t have a large business in Russia,” he told CNN. “It is not one of our major markets. [But] we are absolutely revisiting our relationship [about whether] to do business in Russia.” Last year, Airbnb took bookings for 300m nights across 4 million hosts globally, worth a total of $46.8bn (£35.3bn). The company, which was founded in 2008, was floated in 2020, soaring to a market value of about $100bn. Airbnb joins a rapidly increasing and extensive list of companies that are severing ties or pausing operations in Russia, including Ikea, the global recruitment company Hays, Apple, Netflix and all the major Hollywood studios, the retailers H&amp;M, Marks &amp; Spencer, Burberry and Boohoo, and car manufacturers including Ford, BMW and Mercedes-Benz."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/sep/15/hitachi-to-pull-plug-on-north-wales-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-16T09:46:38Z","webTitle":"Hitachi to pull plug on north Wales nuclear power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/15/hitachi-to-pull-plug-on-north-wales-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/sep/15/hitachi-to-pull-plug-on-north-wales-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"headline":"Hitachi to pull plug on north Wales nuclear power station","bodyText":"The Japanese conglomerate Hitachi has conformed it is abandoning plans to build a new nuclear power station on Anglesey, off the coast of north Wales, dashing hopes for thousands of jobs involved in its construction and knocking the UK’s ambition to become a “net zero carbon” emission country by 2050 off course. The Tokyo-based multinational said Wednesday it was permanently scrapping plans for the £16bn Wylfa power station. “Hitachi made this decision given that 20 months have passed since the suspension, and the investment environment has become increasingly severe due to the impact of Covid-19,” it said in a statement. The company said it would coordinate with the British government and relevant organisations regarding the handling of the planned construction sites and other issues. The decision to scrap the project, which would have provided around 6% of Britain’s electricity, was not expected to have significant impact on Hitachi’s business results as the company has already written down most of the related assets, it added. Work on the Wylfa Newydd project, which is next door to an existing, decommissioned power plant, had already been suspended after Hitachi failed to reach a funding agreement with the UK government, but the planning process continued. Justin Bowden, national officer of the GMB union, said: “This utterly predictable announcement from Hitachi is the outcome of successive government failures to act decisively around new nuclear, and in particular how it is financed. New nuclear is vital in achieving decarbonisation, especially when teamed up with hydrogen. “It’s no coincidence that around the world – almost without exception – it’s governments who finance these projects, as they are the lender of last resort when it comes to keeping the lights on. The fanciful experiment of trying to get foreign companies or governments to fund our future energy needs leaves most ordinary citizens in this country bewildered.” A group of 100 organisations, including unions and businesses, backing plans to build a nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk, also voiced concern about the Wylfa decision. Cameron Gilmour, spokesman for the Sizewell C Consortium said: “This news will have serious ramifications for companies both in Wales and across the UK. The Wylfa nuclear project would have been another important milestone for the UK’s nuclear supply chain and would have created thousands of jobs. “Unless Sizewell C, a replica of the under-construction Hinkley Point C, is given the go-ahead, there is now a serious risk to the future of the UK’s civil nuclear construction capability and the tens of thousands of jobs that go with it.” Dr Doug Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said: “Nuclear power’s ever-rising costs overtook the ever-falling costs of renewables years ago, and a new reactor now supplies electricity at more than double the price of a new offshore windfarm. “Propping up this dying industry has become more and more difficult and expensive for the handful of governments still hoping for a nuclear renaissance. We’re hoping the UK government will take Hitachi‘s decision to abandon Wylfa as final confirmation of what the energy market has long been trying to tell them – Britain’s future is renewable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/04/government-chaos-delays-uk-sahara-energy-link","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-04T23:42:12Z","webTitle":"£18bn project to link UK to huge wind and solar farm in Sahara delayed by a year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/04/government-chaos-delays-uk-sahara-energy-link","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/04/government-chaos-delays-uk-sahara-energy-link","fields":{"headline":"£18bn project to link UK to huge wind and solar farm in Sahara delayed by a year","bodyText":"An £18bn project to connect Britain with a huge wind and solar farm in the Sahara through an undersea cable has been delayed by at least a year because of political ructions in Westminster. The energy startup Xlinks hopes to provide 8% of Britain’s electricity supplies through a 3,800km (2,360-mile) cable linking Morocco with the UK, powering 7m homes by 2030. The project had been expected to begin generating power by 2027. However, that target date now appears unlikely. The Xlinks’ executive chair, Sir Dave Lewis, a former chief executive of Tesco, warned that the recent political turmoil that has seen off three prime ministers in less than six months has stalled its progress. He has been trying to secure a government “contract for difference” – a mechanism under which public subsidies are used to offer low-carbon generators, such as windfarms, a fixed price for power. The arrangement aims to encourage investment by making revenues more predictable. Lewis told the Guardian: “We spent a long time with the then business secretary [Kwasi Kwarteng] who said: ‘We like it a lot but it needs to go through Treasury.’ There was a review with Treasury, Cabinet Office and the business department, which was very positive. “Then we came back to them to start the detail and the political world exploded and, as a result, everything stopped. And everybody has changed, so it’s sort of like you’re starting again. “Time is important for the UK to meet its net zero ambitions, to secure energy supplies and to reduce bills. We have lost a year.” Xlinks was founded in 2019 by its chief executive, Simon Morrish, who has grown the environmental services business Ground Control across the UK. When the Morocco-UK link is complete, Xlinks expects to generate 20 hours of reliable renewable energy a day using the Sahara’s sunshine and breezy night-time conditions. The plan is to build almost 12m solar panels and 530 windfarms over the 960 sq km area of desert. The site, in the Guelmim-Oued Noun region, will also have 20 gigawatt hours of battery storage. The cable transporting power from the site will hug the Moroccan coastline, then pass alongside Portugal, northern Spain and France before looping around the Isles of Scilly to terminate at Alverdiscott in north Devon, where Xlinks has already agreed to 1.8 gigawatt connections. Morocco has an established wind, solar and hydroelectric power industry, and its solar intensity, a measure of generation power, is second only to Egypt and double that of the UK, according to data from Xlinks. The power lines will be laid by the world’s largest cable-laying ship and buried beneath the seabed to mitigate the risk of damage from fishing boats. The company is in the process of studying the seabed and gaining offshore permits. Xlinks hopes to land a strike price of £48 per megawatt hour, lower than the £92.50 agreed for the delayed Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in Somerset. The company argues that despite the scale of the project, it can be more reliable for the security of UK energy supplies than domestic options because UK wind power can be hugely variable. Last week National Grid issued, and later cancelled preparations to launch its emergency winter plan after low wind and solar power left supplies tight. Lewis has personally invested in the Xlinks project, along with Octopus Energy and its founder Greg Jackson. Growing demand for renewable power has stretched supplies across the industry. In response, its sister company XLCC plans to build two factories to manufacture cables in Hunterston on the west coast of Scotland and another at a yet to be announced site in north-east England. The first received planning permission in June, and is expected to create 900 jobs. Lewis, who worked for the consumer goods company Unilever for 27 years, became Tesco’s chief executive in 2014. He quickly had to tackle an accounting black hole and is credited with turning around Britain’s largest retailer before leaving in 2020. He is now chair of Haleon, the consumer goods company spun off from GlaxoSmithKline earlier this year. • This article was amended on 5 and 7 December 2022.

But we’ve been sold a dud","bodyText":"These are unsettling times. As scientists have issued ringing warnings about the dangers we face from continued fossil fuel burning, an energy crisis has been triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This unprecedented double threat clearly requires an urgent response, which the government supplied last week in the form of its energy security strategy. And it includes some eye-catching headlines, particularly on the expansion of nuclear power. But does it deliver what it says on the tin? The answer is straightforward. It fails. At the heart of most definitions of energy security is reliability of supplies for households and businesses. This is usually complemented by a focus on affordability. It is no good if energy is available, but the price is too high for businesses to function or households to keep warm. The new strategy does very little to deal with the immediate impacts of high fossil fuel prices. While the government has announced some help for households via loans and a council tax reduction, this is simply not enough. The energy price cap has already risen to almost £2,000 a year and a further rise is due in the autumn. This comes on top of a wider cost of living crisis and high levels of inflation. While more money to help people pay their bills is needed, this must be accompanied by action to prevent these acute impacts in future. This means making homes more efficient and switching away from fossil fuels for heating. It is nearly a decade since effective policies for home energy efficiency were cancelled and replaced with new approaches, such as the green deal, which have failed spectacularly. As a result, the steady improvements in efficiency and financial benefits to households have virtually stopped. A new programme of home upgrades is urgently needed. This would not only reduce our dependence on gas, but would also cut bills and carbon emissions. According to many headlines, nuclear power is the “centrepiece” of the strategy. The government’s plans are ambitious, but delivery will be difficult. New nuclear plants will not have an impact for many years. The Treasury’s fingerprints are visible in the careful caveats in the strategy, including an insistence that new projects are “subject to a value for money and relevant approvals”. This reflects the long history of rising costs within the nuclear sector and the financial risks that consumers or taxpayers will be exposed to. British nuclear power programmes have been the subject of many false dawns. In 1979, energy minister David Howell announced a programme of 10 nuclear reactors over the next decade. Only one reactor was built, at Sizewell in Suffolk. In 2010, the coalition government agreed to another eight-reactor programme. That new programme has also produced only one plant: Hinkley C in Somerset, which is due to start operating in 2026. While nuclear can reduce emissions and improve some aspects of energy security, the new plans will only be realised if the industry can bring down costs. The real heart of the strategy is increased ambition for offshore wind, which is due to expand at least fourfold by 2030. This is a genuine British success story from which politicians should learn lessons. Initially very expensive, it has been supported by a series of policies by successive governments – and that has brought costs down dramatically. Pushing further with an increased target makes a lot of sense. But it will require more investment in electricity network infrastructure, not just the wind turbines themselves. The government’s willingness to learn from success has clear limits, though. When the strategy turns its attention to onshore wind and solar, logic fails. The costs of both technologies have also fallen dramatically in recent years. They get some warm words, including aspiration that solar capacity will expand by five times by 2035. There are also innovative plans for a few local communities to share the benefits of new onshore wind farms. But a target to double capacity by 2030 was taken out at the 11th hour and very restrictive planning rules for onshore wind remain. Realising these increased ambitions for renewable electricity will require further market reforms. At the moment, cheap renewable power does not translate into low bills for consumers. This is because gas plants often set the wholesale price and their costs are very high. Reforms are needed so that businesses and households can get access to the economic benefits of cheaper renewables. Reforms are also needed to ensure that there is enough flexibility in the system to deal with higher and higher shares of generation that depends on the wind and sun. Finally, what of the role of fossil fuels, which are at the root of the crisis? Plans to produce more in the UK are understandable, but are not the long-term solution to climate change or energy security. They will have very little impact on prices, but could help to squeeze out some Russian imports. The promise of a new independent study of fracking is a distraction, however. It is clear that fracking in the UK is nowhere near as easy to implement as it has been in the United States. Its contribution to gas needs will be modest at best. Industry claims that fracking could produce a large share of the UK’s gas demand are not credible, based on the evidence we have so far. In short, the government has pulled its punches and avoided measures that would have a more immediate impact on energy security – mainly by reducing the amount of energy we need to use. Instead, it has produced a mixed bag of energy supply proposals. While some are credible, a large nuclear power programme will require huge amounts of political and financial capital. History suggests that this will be very difficult to deliver. • Professor Jim Watson is director, UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/10/competition-watchdog-examining-energy-market-interventions-including-possible-price-caps","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-10T08:14:01Z","webTitle":"Competition watchdog examining energy market interventions including possible price caps","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/10/competition-watchdog-examining-energy-market-interventions-including-possible-price-caps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/10/competition-watchdog-examining-energy-market-interventions-including-possible-price-caps","fields":{"headline":"Competition watchdog examining energy market interventions including possible price caps","bodyText":"The Albanese government will receive advice on possible interventions in the energy market as early as next week, including potential price caps, bargaining provisions for smaller energy users, and a legally binding code of conduct for the gas sector. At Senate estimates on Thursday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it was preparing advice on a range of options for a new mandatory code of conduct for the sector, along with guidance on other “regulatory gaps” in the market. It is expected that the government will adopt a suite of reforms to address the 56% increase in electricity prices and the 44% increase in gas prices forecast over the next two years outlined in the October budget. The federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has said all options are on the table. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Treasury this week gave the green light to an intervention, arguing that war-induced price shocks being felt by households and businesses required the government to step in. The ACCC chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, told parliament the agency was looking at “enhancements” to the current regulatory framework that would “in legal terms provide greater transparency, certainty and binding outcomes”. She said this included a mandatory code of conduct for the gas sector – as has been widely expected – which would include a reference to prices in contract negotiations. The treasurer had asked the ACCC to look at whether making the voluntary code of conduct around gas purchase negotiations mandatory would assure supply and lead to reasonable pricing, she said. The Greens senator Nick McKim asked whether the scope of the ACCC’s review had “hard boundaries” or whether the regulator could potentially look at capping retail prices. In response, Cass-Gottlieb said that while the first part of the treasurer’s request related to wholesale prices between gas producers and their purchasers, the ACCC had also been asked to look at any other “regulatory gaps” relevant to the current circumstances facing the east coast gas market. “So there is a possibility that the second more general one would address that [retail price caps],” she said. Capping the wholesale price of gas or coal was also “a possible option” the ACCC would consider as part of its work, she said. The regulator flagged new measures to help smaller purchasers of gas negotiate better deals with producers, with Cass-Gottlieb saying the agency was looking at collective bargaining to improve purchasing power “in multiple ways.” Ahead of the likely government intervention, the Coalition has been targeting Labor over energy prices, with the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, arguing for nuclear power to be considered to help ease the pressure on prices. Speaking on 2GB radio, Dutton said the technology for storing renewable energy was not yet available and he accused the government of being “ideologically driven” to switch off coal and gas off before being able to store renewable energy. “In that scenario, the prices continue to go up because there’s this uncertainty in the market and the lights will go out,” Dutton said. “You can have renewables – everyone’s in favour of that, and if the storage comes along, that’s great – but at the moment, you can’t turn off the old system until a new technology is discovered or the science changes.” In parliament, the energy minister, Chris Bowen, ridiculed the opposition for its anti-renewable stance. “The battery was invented by Alessandra Volta in 1800 … but the leader of the opposition is still catching up with this fact,” Bowen said. “The leader of the opposition doesn’t get it … they don’t understand that renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy. They pay lip service to it but they just hate all the policies that actually deliver renewable energy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/20/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-421-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-20T13:12:27Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 421 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/20/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-421-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/20/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-421-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 421 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine’s future lies in Nato, the western military alliance’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Thursday during his first visit to the country since Russia’s invasion 14 months ago. He pledged continued military support for Ukraine, saying that, so far, Nato allies had trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops and provided €65bn ($71.31bn) of military aid alone. “Nato stands with you today, tomorrow and for as long as it takes,” Stoltenberg stated, before inviting Vladmir Zelenskiy to the Nato summit in Vilnius in July. Zelenskiy said Nato needs to invite Ukraine to become a member and give it a timeframe for accession. “I am grateful for the invitation to visit the summit, but it is also important for Ukraine to receive the corresponding invitation,” he told reporters. “There is not a single objective barrier to the political decision to invite Ukraine into the alliance and now, when most people in Nato countries and the majority of Ukrainians support Nato accession, is the time for the corresponding decisions.” Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s longtime foreign minister, will meet the UN secretary general António Guterres on Monday, according to Russia’s ambassador to the UN. The two last met at the G20 summit in Bali in November. According to ambassador Vassily Nebenzia the Black Sea grain deal will be an item for the meeting on Monday. Denmark, together with the Netherlands, is to donate 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Denmark’s acting defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen said they are not Danish tanks, but tanks “which are bought in collaboration with the Netherlands”. Foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen described it as “a very significant contribution”. Russian state-owned news agency Tass has cited Ismini Palla, spokesperson for the UN office at the joint coordination centre for the deal in Istanbul, saying that “inspections of vessels under the grain deal resumed on 19 April and are scheduled for 20 April”. The Donetsk People’s Republic, the Russian-imposed authority in Ukraine’s occupied Donetsk region, has claimed that overnight a woman has been killed in the city of Donetsk by shelling from Ukrainian armed forces. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine which Russia captured last year will stop using US-produced nuclear fuel as quickly as possible, the Interfax news agency quoted a Russian official as saying. The admiral of Russia’s Pacific fleet has left his position after a check of its combat readiness. Adm Sergei Avakyants left his post as commander on Thursday as it was announced he will oversee a new centre for military sports training and “patriotic education”. Units from the Pacific fleet had been taking part in inspection exercises that were announced by the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, last week. A flash in the sky over Kyiv prompted confusion and alarm as city authorities said it was caused by a Nasa satellite reentering the atmosphere, while the US space agency denied involvement. A “bright glow” was observed over Kyiv around 10pm local time and shortly after, the Ukrainian air force said the flash was “related to the fall of a satellite/meteorite”. Russia’s federal security service, the FSB, seems to be conducting “a large-scale overhaul of domestic security organs,” the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, reports in its update today. The overhaul appears to be related to leaks of data to Ukraine, the ISW reports. The Financial Times has reported that a leaked US intelligence report shows that China refused a request from the Wagner mercenary group for weapons. Wagner’s request in early 2023 suggested “it had some confidence Beijing would be open to arming Moscow, going beyond other non-lethal forms of support for the military campaign provided by Chinese companies,” the FT reported. Switzerland will add the private military Wagner group and news agency RIA to its list of Russian sanctioned entities. A group of Ukrainian servicemen have been accused of treason for giving away information during an unauthorised mission that enabled Russia to attack a military airfield, Ukraine’s SBU security agency said on Thursday. The SBU said in a statement that the servicemen had attempted, “without coordination with the relevant state authorities”, to seize a Russian plane last July after its pilot said he would defect. Ukraine has received two types of air defence system ahead of the Ramstein military group meeting on Thursday, where it will ask for more supplies. A Patriot air defence system delivery was confirmed by the defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, on Wednesday. The second of four promised German Iris-T system were also delivered, according to a German newspaper which had spoken to government officials. No official announcements have been made. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has criticised the delays in the EU plan for jointly buying ammunition for Ukraine. The EU agreed the purchase of 1m artillery rounds for Ukraine in March, but there are still discussions about the plan’s details. The US and other allies of Ukraine are considering an outright ban on most exports to Russia in an attempt to increase economic pressure on Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The report by the Bloomburg business website says discussions are under way ahead of the G7 leaders’ summit in May. It is thought that it will be followed by similar actions by EU member states. The United States announced $325m in new military aid for Ukraine, including additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, advanced missiles and anti-tank mines. It is the 36th security package since the war began in February 2022. The European Commission is proposing €100m (£88m) in compensation for EU farmers affected by the recent influx of Ukrainian grain as well as restrictions on selling wheat and maize in affected countries, in a move to calm tensions with central and eastern Europe. Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the commission, has written to the leaders of Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, setting out support measures after four of those countries banned the import or sale of grain and other food products inside their borders earlier this week. Bulgaria had confirmed its temporary halt on Wednesday. A Ukrainian military spokesperson accused Moscow of a “provocation” after Russian proxy forces said Ukrainian forces had blown up four buildings in the eastern city of Bakhmut, killing 20 civilians. The spokesperson said Ukrainian forces never target civilians. Russia also denies targeting civilians. A Ukrainian brigade that vows to “destroy Russian troops” simulated a skirmish in the woods near Kyiv on Thursday, as the country pushes ahead with plans for a counteroffensive – with the hope of getting similar results to the one that swept across south-eastern Ukraine in autumn 2022. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said on Wednesday during a visit to Sweden that the US looks forward to welcoming Sweden as a Nato member before the alliance’s summit in July, and will encourage Turkey and Hungary to ratify accession. Along with Finland, Sweden applied to join Nato in May last year. Finland’s application was processed in record time and it became the 31st member of the alliance earlier this month. A joint investigation by the public broadcasters of several Nordic countries alleges that Russia has established a programme using spy ships disguised as fishing vessels aimed at giving it the capability to attack windfarms and communications cables in the North Sea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/11/need-one-more-thing-to-worry-about-you-are-probably-daydreaming-wrong","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-11T06:00:34Z","webTitle":"I love to daydream, but now I’m stressed I’ve been doing it wrong  | Emma Beddington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/11/need-one-more-thing-to-worry-about-you-are-probably-daydreaming-wrong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/11/need-one-more-thing-to-worry-about-you-are-probably-daydreaming-wrong","fields":{"headline":"Need one more thing to worry about? You are probably daydreaming wrong","bodyText":"There’s something else for us to worry about (definitely what this summer was lacking): daydreaming. According to the New Scientist, the pleasant reverie in which you imagine yourself in the Desert Island Discs studio modestly explaining your myriad achievements to Lauren Laverne might be bad for you. “Normal” daydreaming is still fine: it fosters creative and lateral thinking, and letting the mind wander could enhance our capacity to learn. But when daydreams prevent you from engaging with life and interfere with your ability to make and maintain relationships, work or learn, researchers call them “maladaptive”. Maladaptive daydreamers use fantasy as a release from stressful thoughts and a difficult present; loneliness, distress and boredom are triggers. Given all that, I don’t suppose you’ll be surprised to hear maladaptive daydreaming seems to be becoming more prevalent. A 2020 study covering 70 countries found participants were more likely to struggle with intense, all-consuming daydreaming in lockdown than during normal life. A 2021 survey of 6,000 Italians found that 17% were atypically preoccupied with their fantasy life. You wouldn’t bet against it reaching epidemic proportions as 2022 staggers on. I wonder if maladaptive is the right characterisation. Who are you calling maladapted? Isn’t retreating to a gentler imaginary world an entirely appropriate way to cope with financial and ecological catastrophe, war playing out around an actual nuclear power plant, Covid, monkeypox and langya (the new zoonotic virus on the block, do keep up)? The typical themes of maladaptive daydreams are, apparently, “love, friendship, self-idealisation, social support and imaginary family”. It would be nicer if we all felt we had those in real life, of course, but who can blame anyone for dreaming of them as the world burns? I’m about ready to give up on reality and surrender to my daydreams, but before I do, I need to train myself to have nicer ones. Mine are all of death, illness, destruction and the bitter settling of scores; day-mares, really. Imagining things are even worse than they actually are: now that’s really maladaptive.

Executives in the energy industry are coordinating efforts with government agencies to assess security arrangements at offshore and onshore sites, to determine whether any best practices employed in other countries, in particular Norway, should be introduced. If the situation escalates, MI5, the Royal Navy and RAF could be called on to provide support for the industry. The move comes after multiple gas leaks were discovered in the Nord Stream pipelines that connect Russia and Germany, leaving natural gas pouring into the Baltic Sea. Sweden found a new leak on Thursday, the fourth discovery of the week. Nato has said the incidents were “deliberate, reckless and irresponsible acts of sabotage”, while Russia has denied it attacked its own pipelines. On Monday, Norway’s oil safety regulator urged oil companies to be more vigilant over unidentified drones seen flying near Norwegian offshore oil and gas platforms. It warned they could pose a risk of accidents or attacks. The developments have prompted the UK energy industry and officials to review risks to its sites. The trade body Offshore Energy (OEUK) said it was in touch with the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on the matter. The CPNI, a government agency, is tasked with reducing the vulnerability of key UK assets – including nuclear power stations and datacentres – to a variety of threats such as terrorism and sabotage. Mark Wilson, the safety director at OEUK, said the action was “precautionary” and a “proportionate, pragmatic response”. He said there was an aspect of uncertainty after the incidents in Europe, adding: “We are not concerned but we are making sure, should anything come up. There is no evidence of any drones or unusual activities around the areas of concern.” A resilience support group spanning industry, regulators and unions has been in place since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February and will study how best to protect Britain’s 11,000 offshore workers. Offshore rigs typically have a 500-metre exclusion zone into which unauthorised vessels, such as fishing boats, cannot enter. No-fly zones and radar monitoring systems are also used to protect assets. There are also ongoing efforts to protect cybersecurity at energy sites. Vladimir Putin has weaponised energy supplies into Europe since the start of the war, cutting gas flows and triggering concerns about blackouts this winter. Danish and Swedish authorities are reviewing the incidents at the Nord Stream pipelines. Their prime ministers have indicated that the leaks were not accidental. Wilson said the outcome of that review would inform any action in the UK, although it could take days for the gas to drain from the Nord Stream pipelines to allow investigators to fully examine the damage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jan/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-kyiv-investigating-fatal-helicopter-crash-british-polish-and-baltic-defence-ministers-to-meet","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T18:49:25Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv to receive ‘hundreds’ of tanks from several nations, says Lithuania – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jan/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-kyiv-investigating-fatal-helicopter-crash-british-polish-and-baltic-defence-ministers-to-meet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jan/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-kyiv-investigating-fatal-helicopter-crash-british-polish-and-baltic-defence-ministers-to-meet","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv to receive ‘hundreds’ of tanks from several nations, says Lithuania – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Lithuania’s defence minister, Arvydas Anušauskas, has said several countries will announce sending Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at Friday’s meeting of defence ministers at the Ramstein airbase in Germany. The total number of armoured vehicles pledged at tomorrow’s meeting would go into hundreds, Anušauskas told Reuters. A group of 11 Nato countries have pledged a raft of new military aid for Ukraine, ahead of a crunch meeting on arms for Kyiv in Germany on Friday. The aid from countries including Britain, Estonia, Latvia and Poland will include tens of stinger air defence systems, S-60 anti-aircraft guns, machine guns and training, according to a statement. Britain plans to send 600 Brimstone missiles to Ukraine to support the country in its fight against Russia, defence minister Ben Wallace has announced. Speaking at a meeting with other defence ministers at the Tapa army base in Estonia, Wallace outlined a previously announced package of military support for Ukraine, including sending Challenger tanks. “We’re in it for the long haul,” he said. Sweden’s government has announced a new package of military aid to Ukraine that will include armoured infantry fighting vehicles and the Archer artillery system. Poland said it was sending S-60 anti-aircraft guns with 70,000 rounds of ammunition and was ready to donate a company of German-made Leopard 2 tanks, “pending (a) wider coalition” of Leopard donors. Estonia’s defence minister, Hanno Pevkur, announced his country will send military equipment to Ukraine worth €113m in its latest package of support. Denmark announced it will donate 19 French-made Caesar howitzer artillery systems to Kyiv. The US and German defence ministers met today as Berlin faces pressure to allow the transfer of German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine. The meeting between Lloyd Austin and Boris Pistorius came as a German government source told Reuters that Berlin would allow Leopard tanks to be sent to Ukraine to help its defence against Russia if the US agreed to send its own tanks. But US officials have publicly and privately insisted that Washington has no plans to send US-made tanks to Ukraine for now, arguing that they would be too difficult for Kyiv to maintain and would require a huge logistical effort to simply run. A German government spokesperson has said it has yet to receive a request from any country for permission to re-export German-made tanks to Ukraine. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has signalled that it could send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine as part of a wider coalition even without Germany’s approval. “Consent is of secondary importance here, we will either obtain this consent quickly, or we will do what is needed ourselves,” Morawiecki said. He later said he was “moderately pessimistic” about Germany giving other countries permission to send the tanks to Ukraine. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, has said the EU “must spare no effort” in helping Ukraine join the EU during a visit to Kyiv where he met Volodymyr Zelenskiy and members of his government. Michel delivered an address to Ukraine’s parliament, hailing the country’s resilience amid Russia’s invasion and saying “Ukraine is the EU and the EU is Ukraine”. The Kremlin has said Russia will achieve its goals in Ukraine “one way or another” and the sooner Kyiv accepts its demands, the sooner the conflict will end. The Kremlin has repeatedly said Russia is ready to halt military operations if Ukraine meets its demands, but Moscow has not publicly outlined details of its negotiating position or what it is seeking from Kyiv in order to end hostilities. The Kremlin said Ukrainian strikes on Russian-annexed Crimea would be “extremely dangerous” after the New York Times reported that US officials were warming to the idea of helping Kyiv strike the peninsula. “This will mean raising the conflict to a new level that will not bode well for European security,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters at his daily briefing. Crimea, which is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, was annexed by Russia in 2014. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish longtime ally of Vladimir Putin, has warned of a nuclear escalation if Russia is defeated in Ukraine, saying that western politicians “repeated like a mantra: ‘To achieve peace, Russia must lose’”, but “it never occurs to any of them to draw the following elementary conclusion from this: the loss of a nuclear power in a conventional war can provoke the outbreak of a nuclear war”. Peskov later said the comments made by the deputy chairman of the security council of Russia were fully in accordance with Russia’s nuclear doctrine. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, says he worries the world is becoming complacent about the dangers posed by the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Grossi, speaking to reporters in Kyiv, said a nuclear accident could happen any day and reiterated the situation at the plant was very precarious. Moldova has requested air defence systems from its allies with the aim of strengthening its capabilities as the war in neighbouring Ukraine continues, its president, Maia Sandu, said. Moldova’s spy chief, Alexandru Musteata, warned last month of a “very high” risk of a new Russian offensive towards his country’s east and said Moscow still aimed to secure a land corridor through Ukraine to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria. A Swedish court has sentenced two brothers to prison for spying for Russia and its military intelligence service GRU for a decade. Iranian-born Peyman Kia, 42, was sentenced to life, while his younger brother, Payam Kia, was sentenced to nine years and 10 months. Between 2014 and 2015, Peyman Kia worked for Sweden’s domestic intelligence agency, and worked with a top-secret unit within the agency that dealt with Swedish spies abroad, according to local media. The case is believed to be one of the most damaging instances of espionage in Sweden’s history. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, says he worries the world is becoming complacent about the dangers posed by the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. The Soviet-era plant, Europe’s largest, was captured by Russian forces in March and has repeatedly come under fire in recent months, raising fears of a nuclear disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the Zaporizhzhia facility. Grossi, speaking to reporters in Kyiv, said a nuclear accident could happen any day and reiterated the situation at the plant was very precarious. He said: I worry that this is becoming routine, that people may believe that nothing has happened so far, so is the director general of the IAEA crying wolf? He said it was his “duty to do everything I can to prevent” an accident from happening at the plant. A German government spokesperson has said it has yet to receive a request from any country for permission to re-export German-made tanks to Ukraine. The comment came as Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, told reporters he was “moderately pessimistic” about Germany giving other countries permission to re-export Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Morawiecki said: I am moderately sceptical, moderately pessimistic because the Germans are defending themselves against this like a devil protects himself against holy water. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, has said the EU “must spare no effort” in helping Ukraine join the EU during a visit to Kyiv where he met Volodymyr Zelenskiy and members of his government. Michel delivered an address to Ukraine’s parliament, hailing the country’s resilience amid Russia’s invasion and saying “Ukraine is the EU and the EU is Ukraine”. He said: I dream that one day, I hope soon, a Ukrainian will hold my job as president of the European Council, or as president of the European parliament, or the commission.” Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, tweeted a photo of him with Michel in the capital, and said the pair discussed the country’s path to EU membership and defence assistance. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Bakhmut, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine. Moldova has requested air defence systems from its allies with the aim of strengthening its capabilities as the war in neighbouring Ukraine continues, its president, Maia Sandu, said. Moldova’s spy chief, Alexandru Musteata, warned last month of a “very high” risk of a new Russian offensive towards his country’s east and said Moscow still aimed to secure a land corridor through Ukraine to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria. Moldova has long had Russian troops based in Transnistria, a predominantly Russian-speaking region in eastern Moldova. The area has been controlled by pro-Russia separatists since 1992, after a short war when Moscow intervened on the side of the rebels. Russian efforts to destabilise Moldova have so far failed, Sandu told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Lithuania’s defence minister, Arvydas Anušauskas, has said several countries will announce sending Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at tomorrow’s meeting of defence ministers at the Ramstein airbase in Germany. Anušauskas told Reuters: Some of the countries will definitely send Leopard tanks to Ukraine, that is for sure. The total number of armoured vehicles pledged at tomorrow’s meeting would go into hundreds, Anušauskas said. Mykhailo Podolyak, a political adviser to the Ukrainian president, has called on allies to “stop trembling at Putin and take the final step” to send tanks to Kyiv. “True leadership is about leading by example, not about looking up to others,” he said in a tweet likely aimed at Germany, after a German government source said Berlin will send German-made tanks to Ukraine as long as the US agrees to do likewise. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: A group of 11 countries have pledged a raft of new military aid for Ukraine, ahead of a crunch meeting on arms for Kyiv in Germany on Friday.

Peskov later said the comments made by the deputy chairman of the security council of Russia were fully in accordance with Russia’s nuclear doctrine. Boris Johnson has urged the west not to fall for Russia’s threat of nuclear war but instead increase its supply of heavy weaponry to Ukraine. The former UK prime minister appeared at the World Economic Forum in Davos to discuss Ukraine – with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, joining via video link. The number of children confirmed dead in Wednesday’s helicopter crash in Brovary is one, Ukraine’s state emergency services has said, not three, as previously stated. The crash took place near a nursery outside Kyiv, killing interior minister Denys Monastyrskiy and 14 other people. As of Thursday morning 16 victims were still in hospital, including six children, and 14 people were confirmed dead, including the child, according to the head of Kyiv region, Olekskiy Kuleba. A Swedish court has sentenced two brothers to prison for spying for Russia and its military intelligence service GRU for a decade. Iranian-born Peyman Kia, 42, was sentenced to life, while his younger brother, Payam Kia, was sentenced to nine years and 10 months.

The case is believed to be one of the most damaging instances of espionage in Sweden’s history. Serbian and pro-Ukraine activists have filed criminal complaints against Russia’s Wagner paramilitary group and its supporters, accusing it of recruiting Serbs to fight in Ukraine. “We have reasonable suspicion that Vulin … gave orders, directives and guidelines that the activities of the Wagner Group in Serbia should not be prevented,” the group’s leader said. Ukraine has suffered a threefold growth in cyber-attacks over the past year, with Russian hacking at times deployed in combination with missile strikes, according to a senior figure in the country’s cybersecurity agency. The attacks from Russia have often taken the form of destructive, disk-erasing wiper malware, said Viktor Zhora, a leading figure in the country’s SSSCIP agency. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here still, with all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Denmark becomes the latest country to send further military support to Ukraine, announcing that it will donate 19 French-made Caesar howitzer artillery systems to Kyiv. The Danish defence minister, Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, said in a statement: We have been in continuous contact with the Ukrainians about the Caesar artillery in particular and I am happy that we have now received broad support from the Danish parliament to donate it to Ukraine’s freedom struggle. Serbian and pro-Ukraine activists filed criminal complaints against Russia’s Wagner paramilitary group and its supporters on Thursday, accusing it of recruiting Serbs to fight in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Čedomir Stojković, a Belgrade-based lawyer who also leads the October civic group, said that those accused include Russia’s ambassador to Serbia, Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko, and Aleksandar Vulin, the head of Serbia’s state Security and Information Agency. “We have reasonable suspicion that Vulin ... gave orders, directives and guidelines that the activities of the Wagner Group in Serbia should not be prevented,” he said. Stojković said that Botsan-Kharchenko, who enjoys diplomatic immunity, could not be prosecuted in Serbia but that he should be ordered to leave the country. Once a criminal complaint is filed, it is up to the state prosecutor to decide whether or not to proceed. Neither Russian embassy to Belgrade nor the BIA replied to Reuters’ requests for comment. Poland’s prime minister has signalled that it could send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine as part of a wider coalition even without Germany’s approval, raising pressure on Berlin before a crunch meeting of allies on more military aid for Kyiv. “Consent is of secondary importance here, we will either obtain this consent quickly, or we will do what is needed ourselves,” the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, told the private broadcaster Polsat News late on Wednesday, Reuters reports. A government spokesperson was not immediately available to comment on whether Morawiecki meant Poland or a group of countries could send tanks without Germany’s consent. Poland had repeatedly signalled that it would only send the tanks as part of a larger coalition. “The most important thing is for Germany, but not only Germany … to offer their modern tanks, their modern heavy weapons, because Ukraine’s ability to defend its freedom may depend on that,” Morawiecki said. Poland and Finland have said they would provide Leopards if Germany lifts its veto as part of a wider coalition, and other countries have indicated they are ready to do so too. The British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, has joined the backlash against comments yesterday by Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s foreign secretary. In his lengthy annual new year press conference yesterday, Lavrov compared the behavious of the west towards Russia with Hitler and Napolean, saying that, using Ukraine as a proxy, “they [the west] are waging war against our country with the same task: the ‘final solution’ of the Russian question. Just as Hitler wanted a ‘final solution’ to the Jewish question, now, if you read Western politicians ... they clearly say Russia must suffer a strategic defeat.” Responding to a call for Jewish organisations to condemn the comments by Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, the British ambassador in Kyiv tweeted: I don’t think it’s just Jewish organisations that should be calling out this insufferable Russian state sponsored antisemitism. It’s been going on for ages, repeatedly articulated, and it has repercussions for everyone when states reduce Holocaust history in this cynical way. Reuters reports that Lavrov has caused outrage before with remarks about Hitler. Last May he said the Nazi leader had “Jewish blood”, drawing angry protests from Israel. Estonia’s defence minister, Hanno Pevkur, has announced his country will send military equipment to Ukraine worth €113m in its latest package of support for the war against Russia. Wallace says the UK has just started another round of basic training of Ukrainian soldiers, with the aim of training at least 20,000 Ukrainian soldiers to repel Russia’s aggression. He concludes by saying: We’re not going anywhere, Mr Putin. We’re here for the long haul. We’re standing by Ukraine. You need to recalculate. You need to make a change. You need to leave Ukraine. Wallace says Britain has “unlocked” a number of military aid packages in the last year, and will be “going further” by sending a squadron of Challenger 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine. The UK will also send at least three batteries of AS-90 155 long-range deep dire artillery, a number of armoured vehicles, including the Bulldog, he said. He continued: Today I can say we’re also going to send another 600 Brimstone missiles into theatre which will be incredibly important in helping Ukraine dominate the battlefield. He said the UK will be working with the US and others “to make sure that this package is put in Ukraine in the right way”. Defence ministers from around the world will gather at the US airbase in Ramstein in Germany on Friday to make it clear to President Vladimir Putin that they stand by Ukraine, Wallace says. President Putin is banking on us getting bored this year. He’s wrong. We will plan for this year and next year and the year after. He adds: We’re in it for the long haul. It is now time to turn the momentum that Ukrainians have achieved and to make sure Russia “understands that the purpose now is to push them back out of Ukraine” and to restore Ukraine’s sovereignty, he says. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is speaking at a joint news conference with his Estonian counterpart, Hanno Pevkur. Wallace says Putin made a number of assumptions when he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine last February: the first, that Ukrainians would not fight. The second, that his military would quickly crush any resistance. Finally, Putin banked on the fact that he “thought the international community was fickle, that it wouldn’t stick together, that we wouldn’t see it through”. Wallace added: None of those have turned out to be true. 2023 is about demonstrating to Putin that the international community isn’t fractured, that the international community is more than ever determined to stand by Ukraine to see it through. Ukraine’s state emergency services has said the number of children confirmed dead in yesterday’s helicopter attack in Brovary is one, not three, as previously stated. The child died when a helicopter carrying the leadership of Ukraine’s interior ministry crashed near a nursery outside Kyiv on Wednesday morning. Ukraine’s national police carried out forensics on body fragments and as a result, the number of dead decreased, said Ukraine’s emergency services. As of Thursday morning 16 victims were still in hospital, including six children, and 14 people were confirmed dead, including the child, according to the head of Kyiv region, Olekskiy Kuleba. The Kremlin has said Russia will achieve its goals in Ukraine “one way or another” and the sooner Kyiv accepts its demands, the sooner the conflict will end. Speaking to reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: The sooner the Ukrainian regime shows its readiness to meet Russia’s demands – which will be achieved one way or another – the sooner everything will end, and the sooner Ukrainian people can begin to recover after this tragedy, which was started by the regime in Kyiv. The Kremlin has repeatedly said Russia is ready to halt military operations if Ukraine meets its demands, but Moscow has not publicly outlined details of its negotiating position or what it is seeking from Kyiv in order to end hostilities. Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he is “sincerely grateful” to the Swedish government after it announced a new package of military aid to Ukraine that will include armoured infantry fighting vehicles and the Archer artillery system. The package is worth 4.3bn Swedish crowns (£339m), and will include about 50 of Sweden’s tracked and armoured Type 90 infantry fighting vehicles, which can be used to transport up to eight infantry soldiers and is equipped with a 40-mm automatic cannon. The government did not specify how many Archer systems it would supply. The package will also include light, portable NLAW anti-tank weapons, mine-clearing equipment and assault rifles. The infantry fighting vehicles, Archer systems and NLAW anti-tank weapons are “powerful weapons that Ukraine’s army needs”, Zelenskiy tweeted. Before the package was presented today, Sweden had announced around 5bn Swedish crowns of military aid to Ukraine as well as several instalments of humanitarian supplies. Ukraine’s victory is of “almost indescribable importance” Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, told a news conference, adding that Ukraine was fighting for the freedom of all of Europe. The US and German defence ministers met today as Berlin faces pressure to allow the transfer of German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine. Germany remains “one of our most important allies”, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said at the start of his meeting with Boris Pistorius, who hours earlier had been sworn in as Germany’s new defence minister. Before the meeting, Austin thanked the German government “for all that it has done to strengthen Ukraine’s self-defence”, without specifically mentioning the issue of tanks. Pistorius said Germany was ready to support Ukraine and that Berlin stood shoulder to shoulder with its allies. He said: Together with our partners, we will continue to support Ukraine in its struggle for freedom and territorial independence and sovereignty. Their meeting came as a German government source told Reuters that Berlin would allow Leopard tanks to be sent to Ukraine to help its defence against Russia if the US agreed to send its own tanks. But US officials have publicly and privately insisted that Washington has no plans to send US-made tanks to Ukraine for now, arguing that they would be too difficult for Kyiv to maintain and would require a huge logistical effort to simply run. Colin Kahl, the Pentagon’s top policy adviser, said the Pentagon still was not prepared to meet Ukraine’s calls for M1 Abrams main battle tanks. A Swedish court has sentenced two brothers to prison for spying for Russia and its military intelligence service GRU for a decade, in what has been called one of the country’s worst cases of espionage. Iranian-born Peyman Kia, 42, was sentenced to life, while his younger brother, Payam Kia, was sentenced to nine years and 10 months. A life sentence in Sweden generally means a minimum of 20-25 years in prison. Between 2014 and 2015, Peyman Kia worked for Sweden’s domestic intelligence agency, and worked with a top-secret unit within the agency that dealt with Swedish spies abroad, according to local media. Payam Kia, 35, helped his brother and “dismantled and broke a hard drive which was later found in a trash can” when his brother was arrested, according to the charge sheet obtained by the Associated Press. The pair appeared before Stockholm district court, where they faced charges of working together to pass information to Russia between September 2011 and September 2021. In its verdict, the court said it was “beyond reasonable doubt that the brothers, together and in consultation, without authorisation and for the benefit of Russia and the GRU, acquired, forwarded and disclosed information” to a foreign power with the purpose of damaging Sweden’s security. Explaining the verdict of a life sentence, the court said the older brother had a “full understanding of the damaging effects – he has acquired, forwarded and disclosed the information to Russia, which constitutes the main threat to Sweden’s security”. Although it had “not been possible to reach full certainty as to what happened”, the court said a picture of what happened “is sufficiently clear for the defendants to be held responsible”. The brothers denied any wrongdoing throughout the trial, which was held behind closed doors and with evidence that is secret. The case is believed to be one of the most damaging instances of espionage in Sweden’s history because the men compiled a list of all the employees within the Swedish security and intelligence service, known by its acronym Sapo. The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, says he is in Kyiv for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and members of his government. The people of Ukraine “need and deserve our support”, Michel said in a video posted to Twitter. His trip comes just two weeks before the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, is set to visit the Ukrainian capital for a summit. The Kremlin said on Thursday that Ukrainian strikes on Russian-annexed Crimea would be “extremely dangerous”, after the New York Times reported that US officials were warming to the idea of helping Kyiv strike the peninsula. “This will mean raising the conflict to a new level that will not bode well for European security,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters at his daily briefing. Crimea, which is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, was annexed by Russia in 2014. The comments came as Sweden announced it would be sending the Archer artillery system for use by Kyiv, a vehicle-mounted self-propelled gun howitzer made by Bofors BAE. The country has also committed to sending infantry fighting vehicles in a move announced in a press conference in Stockholm on Thursday morning. A government source in Berlin told Reuters Germany would send German-made tanks to Ukraine so long as the US agreed to do likewise, as Nato partners remained out of step over how best to arm Ukraine in its war against Russia. Germany’s presiden,t Frank-Walter Steinmeier, promised further military support to Ukraine and warned the incoming defence minister that Germany’s armed forces must once again become capable of protecting the country. The Social Democrat Boris Pistorius was officially made minister on Thursday in a ceremony attended by Steinmeier. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish longtime ally of Vladimir Putin, has warned of a nuclear escalation if Russia is defeated in Ukraine, saying that western politicians “repeated like a mantra: ‘To achieve peace, Russia must lose’”, but “it never occurs to any of them to draw the following elementary conclusion from this: the loss of a nuclear power in a conventional war can provoke the outbreak of a nuclear war”. Peskov later said the comments made by the deputy chairman of the security council of Russia were fully in accordance with Russia’s nuclear doctrine. The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said people spent too much time obsessing about Putin and worrying about escalating the conflict. “How can you escalate against a guy who is doing all-out war against a civilian population?” he said. He also cast doubt on whether Russia would use nuclear weapons and internationally isolate itself from countries like China. Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of Kyiv, said on Thursday that 10 adults and six children remained in hospital after Wednesday’s helicopter crash, which killed the interior minister, Denys Monastyrskiy, and 14 others. Kuleba said families of the victims would receive financial assistance, and that children from the kindergarten damaged when the helicopter fell were studying in nearby preschools. Ukraine’s state broadcaster, Suspilne, is reporting that 11 people are still considered missing after Saturday’s attack on a high-rise building in Dnipro. The Kremlin said on Thursday that Ukrainian strikes on Russian-annexed Crimea would be “extremely dangerous”, after the New York Times reported that US officials were warming to the idea of helping Kyiv strike the peninsula. “This will mean raising the conflict to a new level that will not bode well for European security”, Reuters reports the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters at his daily briefing. Crimea, which is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, was annexed by Russia in 2014. The comments came as the Swedish government announced it would be sending the Archer artillery system for use by Kyiv, a vehicle-mounted self-propelled gun howitzer made by Bofors BAE. It has long been requested by the Ukrainian side. Peskov also commented on the remarks made earlier by Dmitry Medvedev that threatened a nuclear response if Russia were defeated in Ukraine. [see 7.43 GMT] Peskov said the comments were in full accordance with Moscow’s nuclear doctrine. Medvedev had said western politicians “repeated like a mantra: ‘To achieve peace, Russia must lose’”, but “it never occurs to any of them to draw the following elementary conclusion from this: the loss of a nuclear power in a conventional war can provoke the outbreak of a nuclear war”. As well as the Archer artillery system, Sweden has committed to sending infantry fighting vehicles in a move announced in a press conference in Stockholm on Thursday morning. Reuters notes that the Swedish government has been silent on the number of Archer artillery systems that it is intending to send to Ukraine. Sweden has 48 Archer systems, which is a vehicle-mounted self-propelled gun howitzer made by Bofors BAE. The Swedish government said it had ordered its defence forces to also prepare shipment of the system. The Swedish government has announced it is sending a further package of military aid to Ukraine, which will include the Archer artillery system, which the Ukrainians have long sought. The package also includes the anti-tank robot-57. Fifty combat vehicles will also be sent, which Sweden’s energy and industry minister, Ebba Busch, this morning described as “one of the world’s best combat vehicles”. Ulf Kristersson, the prime minister of Sweden, said “Ukraine’s desire for what they need most weighs heavily”. The air alarm that was in place in Ukraine this morning has ended. It appears to have been caused by Russian planes taking off in Belarus, where the Belarus and Russian air forces have been carrying out joint drills. Oleksiy Kuleba, governor of Kyiv, has provided an update on the situation following yesterday’s helicopter crash which claimed the life of interior minister Denys Monastyrskiy and 14 other people. He posted on Telegram to say: As a result of the tragedy in Brovary, 16 people remain in hospitals, six of whom are children. Others receive treatment on an outpatient basis. Financial assistance will be allocated to the families of the victims. The place where the helicopter fell has been cleared of debris. Windows and doors will be repaired in the damaged building in the near future. Children from the damaged kindergarten are organized to study in nearby preschools, taking into account the wishes of the parents. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has promised further military support to Ukraine and warned the incoming defence minister that Germany’s armed forces must once again become capable of protecting the nation. Social Democrat Boris Pistorius was officially made minister on Thursday in a ceremony attended by Steinmeier. The role of German president is largely ceremonial. Russia’s attack on Ukraine has destroyed Europe’s security order, Steinmeier said at the event, Reuters reports. Steinmeier stressed that Germany would continue to support Ukraine militarily and would help “in the reconstruction of a battered country”. “Germany is not at war, but the years of the peace dividend from which we Germans have benefited so long and abundantly are over,” Steinmeier said. “We have to respond to threats that also target us,” he said. Pistorius is due to meet his US counterpart Lloyd Austin later today, and on Friday defence leaders from around 50 countries and Nato gather at Germany’s Ramstein air base to discuss how to supply Kyiv with more weapons. A German government source has told Reuters that Berlin will only allow German-made tanks to be sent to Ukraine if the United States agrees to send its own tanks. Here is an image from Cambodia today, where Ukrainian demining teams are receiving training from their Cambodian counterparts. Ukraine is currently experiencing an air alert. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has posted to Telegram to tell residents: Residents of Lviv oblast and the entire territory of Ukraine announced an air alert. There is a threat of a missile strike. Immediately go to a shelter or a room where the rule of “two walls” applies. During almost 11 months of full-scale war, we have seen more than once what the enemy is capable of in his hatred and desire to destroy. Take care of yourself and your loved ones, warn those who might not have heard the sound of sirens. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne is reporting that eleven people are still considered missing after Saturday’s attack on a high-rise building in Dnipro. Yesterday it reported that, according to deputy mayor of Dnipro, Mykhailo Lysenko, “municipal workers are still finding remains of bodies while sorting through the debris”, and the remains are being handed over to forensic experts for DNA testing. My colleague Graeme Wearden is covering Davos live for the Guardian, and reports this from former UK prime minister Boris Johnson: Boris Johnson is speaking at this morning’s Ukraine breakfast now, introduced as a “legendary figure” in Ukraine. The former UK prime minister is asked what he thinks is going through Putin’s mind – is there an opportunity to negotiate? Johnson says he is lost in admiration for president Zelenskiy, and the heroism of the Ukrainian people. But, he warns, we can spend too much time obsessing about Putin, and worrying about escalating the conflict. Johnson says he heard these concerns before he approved supply of shoulder-launched anti-tank weapons. But, he says: How can you escalate against a guy who is doing all out war against a civilian population? Putin is not going to use nuclear weapons, Johnson insists, comparing Russia’s president to “the fat boy in Dickens who wants to make our flesh creep”. Using nuclear weapons would create economic paralysis, Johnson points out. Plus, states who are giving him the benefit of the doubt woud turn massively against him – he cites India and China. You can read more here: Davos day 3 – Johnson says Putin is not going to use nuclear weapons – live Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish long-term ally of Vladimir Putin, has been threatening nuclear war again on Telegram. Medvedev has been deputy chairman of the security council of Russia since 2020, and has previously held the roles of both president and prime minister of Russia. On Telegram he said: Tomorrow, at Nato’s Ramstein base, the great military leaders will discuss new tactics and strategies, as well as the supply of new heavy weapons and strike systems to Ukraine. And this was right after the forum in Davos, where underdeveloped political party-goers repeated like a mantra: “To achieve peace, Russia must lose.” And it never occurs to any of them to draw the following elementary conclusion from this: the loss of a nuclear power in a conventional war can provoke the outbreak of a nuclear war. The nuclear powers did not lose major conflicts on which their fate depends. But this should be obvious to anyone. Even to a western politician who has retained at least some trace of intelligence. While Russia’s nuclear doctrine restricts the use of the weapons to a limited set of circumstances, one of the circumstances is “situations critical to the national security of the Russian Federation.” Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia has reported on Telegram that the “outbuilding of a private household” and “a private house in which no one lived” have been destroyed by Ukrainian fire over the border into his region. He stated that “There are no victims or injured.” The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne is reporting that Yaroslav Yanushevych, Ukraine’s governor of the partially-occupied Kherson region, which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed, has said that the region was shelled multiple times and four people were injured as a result yesterday. It reports he said “On 18 January, the Russian army shelled the Kherson region 56 times with artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and mortars, wounding four people. Kherson was shelled 19 times. Shells hit an educational institution and houses.” This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog from my colleague Helen Sullivan. I will be with you for the next few hours. You can contact me on martin.belam@theguardian.com Germany will send German-made tanks to Ukraine so long as the United States agrees to do likewise, a government source in Berlin told Reuters, as Nato partners remained out of step over how best to arm Ukraine in its war against Russia. Ukraine has pleaded for modern Western weapons, especially heavy battle tanks, so it can regain momentum following some battlefield successes in the second half of 2022 against Russian forces that invaded last February. Berlin has veto power over any decision to export its Leopard tanks, fielded by NATO-allied armies across Europe and seen by defence experts as the most suitable for Ukraine. Several times in recent days, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has stressed, behind closed doors, the condition that U.S. tanks should also be sent to Ukraine, the German government source said on condition of anonymity. When asked about Germany’s stance, U.S. President Joe Biden’s spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said: “The president believes that each country should make their own sovereign decisions on what steps of security assistance and what kinds of equipment they are able to provide Ukraine.” The British and Polish defence ministers will meet with their counterparts from the Baltic states in Estonia, in a Ramstein today pre-meeting – ahead of a wider defence summit on Friday – designed to put further pressure on Germany to move forward with sending Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. But there are signs that London’s manoeuvres are irritating Berlin. A German government source told Reuters that the UK appeared to be ignoring Berlin’s recent decision to provide a Patriot missile defence system and 40 Marder fighting vehicles. Accusing the UK of acting in response to “internal political pressure”, government sources added that leaning on allies was “not helpful”. They added: “The delivery of tanks to Ukraine is not taboo. But such questions will continue to be clarified in transatlantic lockstep”: Wednesday’s crash outside Kyiv came as the head of NATO said at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos that allies were set to provide “heavier weapons” to the war-battered country. Ukraine did not claim direct Russian involvement in the helicopter crash, but President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the tragedy was a consequence of the war. “There are no accidents at war. These are all war results,” Zelensky said in English, appearing by video link at Davos. The helicopter carrying Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky crashed next to a kindergarten and a residential building in Brovary, a commuter town for the capital Kyiv that was the scene of fierce fighting with Russian forces last year, AFP reports. Fourteen people were killed, including Monastyrsky, other ministry officials and a child, Zelensky said in his evening address to the nation. Another 25 people were wounded, including 11 children. He added that an investigation had been opened “to clarify all the circumstances of the disaster”. “Minister Denys Monastyrsky, (his deputy) Yevhen Yenin and their colleagues who died in the crash are not people who can be easily replaced,” Zelensky said. “It is a truly huge loss for the state. My condolences to the families.” Dmytro Serbyn, who was in his apartment when the helicopter crashed, rushed to help children as soon as he saw flames billowing over the kindergarten. “They were looking for their parents, children were crying … their faces were cut and covered in blood,” Serbyn told AFP. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next few hours. Our top story this morning: Ukrainian authorities on Thursday were investigating the circumstances surrounding a helicopter crash that killed the country’s interior minister and 13 others. And coming up today, the British and Polish defence ministers will meet with their counterparts from the Baltic states in Estonia, in a Ramstein pre-meeting designed to put further pressure on Germany to move forward with the Leopard 2s. Here are the other key recent developments: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stepped up calls for Ukraine’s army to be supplied with heavy tanks and urged “resolve and speed” of decision-making from western allies. Addressing a packed gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos via video link on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president warned that “tyranny is outpacing democracy”. Nato countries are set to announce new “heavier weapons” for Ukraine, the alliance’s chief has said. Many of Ukraine’s allies will meet on Friday at the Ramstein military base in Germany, including all 30 Nato members. ting vehicles, while France offered its highly mobile AMX-10 RCs. The European Union’s head also spoke in favour of the west providing tanks to Ukraine. “We, the EU, will continue to support them for as long as it takes,” Charles Michel, the European Council president, said on Wednesday. “The time is now – they urgently need more equipment and I am personally in favour of supplying tanks to Ukraine.” Germany’s chancellor avoided committing to the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Olaf Scholz did not mention the Leopard tanks when a Ukrainian delegate asked him “why the hesitancy” in signing off their re-export at the Davos summit. Canada announced it would donate 200 armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine. The move came during a visit to Kyiv by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. Zelenskiy thanked the Canadian people and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “on this difficult day”. Bulgaria helped Ukraine survive Russia’s early onslaught by secretly supplying it with large amounts of desperately needed diesel and ammunition, the politicians responsible have said. Poland’s president has warned that Russia could be planning a new offensive in the coming months, calling on countries to provide Ukraine with “weapons, weapons, weapons”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has written a letter inviting the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, for talks, which was handed to the Chinese delegation in Davos, said the Ukrainian leader’s wife, Olena Zelenska. Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the past two months. Vladimir Putin has said he has “no doubt” that Russia’s victory in Ukraine is “inevitable”. He announced that Russia’s military-industrial complex was ramping up production during a visit to a factory in St Petersburg. Four people have been detained by Moscow police at a makeshift memorial dedicated to victims of Saturday’s deadly missile strike on a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, according to a report."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-has-installed-rocket-launchers-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-says-ukraine","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-09T18:52:24Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Putin says ‘agreement will have to be reached’ to end conflict – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-has-installed-rocket-launchers-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-says-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-has-installed-rocket-launchers-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-says-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Putin says ‘agreement will have to be reached’ to end conflict – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s almost 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin mentioned a potential settlement to end his war in Ukraine on Friday while still claiming that his “special military operation” was going to plan. Putin also discussed the potential for a nuclear war in his remarks on Friday, saying that Russian nuclear doctrine doesn’t allow for a preventive strike and that in the case of all-out war, strikes against Russia would be “inevitable”. Putin’s remarks came a day after he appeared to revel in recent Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. Drinking what appeared to be sparkling wine, Putin vowed to keep battering Ukraine’s energy grid despite an outcry against the systematic attacks that have plunged millions into cold and darkness as winter sets in. Putin also said Russia may cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the G7’s price cap on its oil. His comments came after the G7, the EU and Australia announced a $60-a-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil last week. Russian forces have shelled the “entire frontline” in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, has said. The fiercest fighting was near the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, he said, adding that Russian troops were also trying to advance near Lyman, which was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in November. The UK’s ambassador to the UN, Barbara Woodward, said Russia is attempting to obtain more weapons from Iran, including hundreds of ballistic missiles. Moscow is offering Tehran an “unprecedented level” of military and technical support in return for it supplying weapons for the war in Ukraine, Woodward told reporters. Meanwhile, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, warned that Russia is “expanding and modernising its nuclear arsenal”. Ukraine’s state-run power agency has accused Russian forces of abducting two senior Ukrainian staff at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Energoatom said the two abducted members of staff were beaten before being driven off in an “unknown direction” on Thursday. A third worker, who was detained, was responsible for safety at the plant, it said. Russian forces have installed multiple rocket launchers at Ukraine’s shut-down Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to Ukrainian officials. Energoatom said Russian forces occupying the plant have placed several Grad multiple rocket launchers near one of its six nuclear reactors, raising fears that Europe’s largest atomic power station could be used as a base to fire on Ukrainian territory and heightening radiation dangers. The UK Ministry of Defence has said Russia has likely received a resupply of Iranian Shahed-131 and 136 loitering munitions. Friday’s intelligence update comes following new reports over the past three weeks of attacks involving these devices. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian general staff reported shooting down at least 14 Shahed-136s. Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, discussed the latest Russian attacks on the country’s infrastructure in a phone call on Friday. Sunak said “more anti-air guns and further short-range air defence missiles would arrive in the coming weeks”, Downing Street said. A Russian court has sentenced the opposition politician Ilya Yashin to eight and a half years in prison on charges of spreading false information meant to discredit the Russian army. The verdict marks the most high-profile case to date of a Russian dissident being jailed for opposing the invasion of Ukraine. Representatives from Russia and the US met in Istanbul on Friday to discuss “difficult questions”, Russian state media reported. A US embassy spokesperson confirmed that a senior State department official met with Russian interlocutors to discuss “a narrow set of bilateral issues” that did not involve the war in Ukraine. Russian athletes have been offered a path to compete at the Paris 2024 Games even if the war in Ukraine continues to rage for another 18 months. It comes after a proposal was made by the Olympic Council of Asia to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to take part in its qualifying competitions for 2024 – even though they are still banned by most sports. The American basketball star Brittney Griner returned to the US early on Friday after being freed in a high-profile prisoner exchange from nearly 10 months in detention in Russia. Griner was seen getting off a plane at joint base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas, after she was swapped for the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. Following his release from US detention, the notorious arms dealer, Viktor Bout, told RT that it was difficult to find the words to describe his feelings after being freed. Nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, Bout is a former Soviet lieutenant colonel who was serving a 25-year sentence for conspiring to sell tens of millions of dollars in weapons US officials said were to be used against Americans. The prisoner exchange of Viktor Bout for Brittney Griner should not be seen as a step towards improving US-Russia bilateral relations, the Kremlin said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov’s comments came as Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, said 30 more embassy staff would have to leave in the new year because of visa restrictions, according to state-owned news agency Ria. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has announced in today’s Guardian that he will place new sanctions on 2,000 individuals and 400 entities across the world with connections to the Kremlin. “We are right to express our horror and revulsion, but our words will always count for more when they are backed by action,” Cleverly wrote. “I will ensure this remains the theme of British diplomacy. We are not passive observers and we should not merely voice our feelings: we will use our country’s leverage to make a difference.” The US has announced fresh sanctions on dozens of people and entities over alleged human rights abuse or corruption across nine countries, including Russia, China and Iran. The latest sanctions list includes Russia’s Central Election Commission, which Washington accused of helping to oversee and monitor what the US said are “sham referendums” held in Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine, as well as 15 of its members. President Joe Biden has authorised $275m in military aid for Ukraine, the White House said. The new package will include weapons and artillery rounds, as well as equipment to help Ukraine boost its air defences, according to a statement by the US defence department. My colleagues Andrew Roth, Pjotr Sauer and Helen Sullivan have the full story on the comments made earlier today by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on a potential settlement to end the war in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin mentioned a potential settlement to end his war in Ukraine on Friday while still claiming that his “special military operation” was going to plan. The Russian president said during remarks at a press conference in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan: The settlement process as a whole, yes, it will probably be difficult and will take some time. But one way or another, all participants in this process will have to agree with the realities that are taking shape on the ground. The remarks came just days after Putin appeared to be girding Russians for a protracted war in Ukraine, saying that his military operation could be a “long-term process”. Initially, Russian commanders expected the war would last just a matter of weeks before a Russian victory, according to plans captured at the beginning of the war. It is now in its 10th month and Russia has been forced to retreat for several months. Despite all evidence to the contrary, Putin claimed that his military operation was going to plan. “Everything is stable. There are no questions or problems there,” he said, adding that information was being given to the public transparently. Putin also discussed the potential for a nuclear war in his remarks on Friday, saying that Russian nuclear doctrine doesn’t allow for a preventive strike and that in the case of all-out war, strikes against Russia would be “inevitable”, adding: However, nothing will remain of the enemy. Read the full story here: Relations between Moscow and Washington continue to remain “in a sorry state”, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was cited by Russian state media as saying. Russian state-run news agency Tass quoted him as saying that the prisoner exchange of Viktor Bout for Brittney Griner should not be seen as a step towards improving US-Russia bilateral relations. Peskov was quoted as saying: The talks were exclusively on the topic of the exchange. It’s probably wrong to draw any hypothetical conclusions that this may be a step towards overcoming the crisis in bilateral relations. His comments came as Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, said 30 more embassy staff would have to leave in the new year because of visa restrictions, according to state-owned news agency Ria. Echoing Peskov’s earlier comments, Antonov was quoted as saying that he did not see anything positive about the current state of bilateral ties. Russian diplomats spent months pushing for the release of a Russian assassin from German custody before finally agreeing to release the US basketball star Brittney Griner in exchange for the arms dealer Viktor Bout, according to US officials. Vadim Krasikov was sentenced to life in prison in Germany after being convicted of murdering the former Chechen fighter Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, in a park in Berlin in broad daylight in 2019. The killing sparked outrage in Germany and prompted the government to expel two Russian diplomats at the start of legal proceedings in December 2019, leading to a reciprocal response by Moscow. German authorities have said the killing was committed at the behest of Russia’s intelligence services. US officials have told the New York Times that Russia wanted Krasikov “as part of the deal” in exchange for releasing Griner and Paul Whelan, who remains in Russian detention. The paper writes that officials approached their German counterparts to see if they would consider freeing Krasikov, including exploring a sort of three-way deal that would give the Germans something in return. Here’s some more detail about the US’s new $275m military aid package for Ukraine, announced by the White House earlier. The new package will include weapons and artillery rounds, as well as equipment to help Ukraine boost its air defences, according to a statement by the US defence department. It will also include rockets for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (Himars) launchers, 155mm ammunition, Humvee military vehicles and generators, according to a document seen by Reuters and people familiar with the package. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. The UK’s ambassador to the UN, Barbara Woodward, said Russia is attempting to obtain more weapons from Iran, including hundreds of ballistic missiles. Moscow is offering Tehran an “unprecedented level” of military and technical support in return for it supplying weapons for the war in Ukraine, Woodward told reporters. Since August, Iran had transferred hundreds of drones – also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) – to Russia, which had used them to “kill civilians and illegally target civilian infrastructure” in Ukraine, she said. Woodward said: Russia is now attempting to obtain more weapons, including hundreds of ballistic missiles. In return, Russia is offering Iran an unprecedented level of military and technical support. We’re concerned that Russia intends to provide Iran with more advanced military components, which will allow Iran to strengthen their weapons capability. Speaking ahead of a meeting of the UN’s security council, she also said Britain was “almost certain that Russia is seeking to source weaponry from North Korea (and) other heavily sanctioned states, as their overstocks palpably dwindle”. The relationship between Moscow and Tehran is transforming into “a full-fledged defence partnership” with weapons and military expertise flowing in both directions, senior Biden administration officials told NBC News. The officials said Russia is looking to collaborate with Iran on weapons development, including possibly establishing a joint production line for drones in Russia. They added: This partnership poses a threat not just to Ukraine, but to Iran’s neighbours in the region. The US has announced fresh sanctions on dozens of people and entities over alleged human rights abuse or corruption across nine countries, including Russia, China and Iran. The latest sanctions list includes Russia’s Central Election Commission, which Washington accused of helping to oversee and monitor what the US said are “sham referendums” held in Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine, as well as 15 of its members. The US treasury department also took action against four people it accused of being directly involved in Russia’s filtration operations. The US state department designated two Russian nationals over alleged human rights abuse against Ukrainian civilians. Meanwhile, the White House said President Joe Biden had authorised $275m in military aid for Ukraine. Canada has imposed fresh sanctions on Russia, Iran and Myanmar over alleged human rights violations, its foreign ministry said. The measures included sanctions against 33 current or former senior Russian officials and six entities involved in alleged “systematic human rights violations” against Russian citizens who protested against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it said in a statement. Since President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine, Canada has imposed sanctions on more than 1,500 individuals and entities from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Canada’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, said: There is more work to be done, but Canada will never stop standing up for human rights. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has warned that Russia is “expanding and modernising its nuclear arsenal” while President Vladimir Putin engages in “deeply irresponsible nuclear sabre-rattling”. Speaking at a ceremony at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, Austin said: As the Kremlin continues its cruel and unprovoked war of choice against Ukraine, the whole world has seen Putin engage in deeply irresponsible nuclear saber-rattling. Here’s the official order President Joe Biden signed commuting the notorious arms trafficker, Viktor Bout, as shared by CNN’s Kevin Liptak. The conditions of Bout’s commutation include that he not return to the US and not profit from any book or movie about his arrest or release. Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, discussed the latest Russian attacks on the country’s infrastructure in a phone call today, Downing Street said. Zelenskiy thanked the UK “for its crucial support to help restore power through the supply of generators” during the call, a No 10 spokesperson said. Sunak “paid tribute” to the success of Kyiv’s troops in “intercepting dozens of potentially devastating missiles” this week, they continued, and said the UK was “thinking of the Ukrainian people as they continued to defend their country through the winter”. They added: Updating on the latest lethal aid deliveries from the UK, the prime minister said that more anti-air guns and further short-range air defence missiles would arrive in the coming weeks. Both leaders agreed on the importance of pre-empting Russia’s insincere calls for a ceasefire and the prime minister added that the Kremlin needed to withdraw its forces before any agreement could be considered. The leaders agreed to speak again in the coming weeks, the spokesperson said. Zelenskiy tweeted about his call with Sunak: It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russian forces have shelled the “entire front line” in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, has said. The fiercest fighting was near the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, he said, adding that Russian troops were also trying to advance near Lyman, which was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in November. Vladimir Putin has said “ultimately an agreement will have to be reached” to end the conflict in Ukraine, but said he was wary of doing so following the Minsk agreements. Russia’s president also acknowledged that there had been some problems supplying equipment and clothes to the 300,000 men who were conscripted to fight in Ukraine in recent months. Putin also said Russia may cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the G7’s price cap on its oil. His comments came after the G7, the EU and Australia announced a $60-a-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil last week. Ukraine’s state-run power agency has accused Russian forces of abducting two senior Ukrainian staff at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Energoatom said the two abducted members of staff were beaten before being driven off in an “unknown direction” on Thursday.

The verdict marks the most high-profile case to date of a Russian dissident being jailed for opposing the invasion of Ukraine. Russia has told Zambia it pardoned a Zambian student to go and fight in Ukraine, where he was killed, according to the Zambian foreign affairs minister. Zambia has demanded answers over the death of Lemekhani Nyirenda, after Russia announced he had been killed on the battlefield in Ukraine in September. Representatives from Russia and the US met in Istanbul on Friday to discuss “difficult questions”, Russian state media reported. A US embassy spokesperson confirmed that a senior State department official met with Russian interlocutors to discuss “a narrow set of bilateral issues” that did not involve the war in Ukraine. A senior Orthodox Christian cleric has been accused of engaging in anti-Ukrainian activity by supporting Russian policies in social media posts, Ukraine’s security service (SBU) said. The SBU’s statement followed a series of raids of property used by a Ukrainian branch of the Orthodox church, including the 1,000-year-old Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex, as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”. Russian athletes have been offered a path to compete at the Paris 2024 Games even if the war in Ukraine continues to rage for another 18 months. It comes after a proposal was made by the Olympic Council of Asia to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to take part in its qualifying competitions for 2024 – even though they are still banned by most sports. The American basketball star Brittney Griner returned to the US early on Friday after being freed in a high-profile prisoner exchange from nearly 10 months in detention in Russia. Griner was seen getting off a plane at joint base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas, after she was swapped for the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. Following his release from US detention, the notorious arms dealer, Viktor Bout, told RT that it was difficult to find the words to describe his feelings after being freed. Nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, Bout is a former Soviet lieutenant colonel who was serving a 25-year sentence for conspiring to sell tens of millions of dollars in weapons US officials said were to be used against Americans. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has announced in today’s Guardian that he will place new sanctions on 2,000 individuals and 400 entities across the world with connections to the Kremlin. “We are right to express our horror and revulsion, but our words will always count for more when they are backed by action,” Cleverly wrote. “I will ensure this remains the theme of British diplomacy. We are not passive observers and we should not merely voice our feelings: we will use our country’s leverage to make a difference.” Good afternoon from London. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today, here to bring you all the latest news from Ukraine. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. Vladimir Putin said Russia may cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the G7’s price cap on its oil. His comments came after the G7, the EU and Australia announced a $60 a barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil last week. Speaking to reporters, the Russian president said: I have already said that we simply will not sell to those countries that make such decisions. We will think, maybe even about the possible, if necessary … reduction in production. He described the west’s price cap move as “stupid” and that energy prices would “skyrocket” for those who imposed the caps. But he said Russia had an agreement with Opec+ about production, so such a drastic step was still only a possibility. He said: We are thinking about this, there are no solutions yet. And concrete steps will be outlined in the decree of the president of Russia, which will be released in the next few days. Russian athletes have been offered a path to compete at the Paris 2024 Games even if the war in Ukraine continues to rage for another 18 months. It comes after a proposal was made by the Olympic Council of Asia to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to take part in its qualifying competitions for 2024 – even though they are still banned by most sports. The International Olympic Committee will now explore the OCA’s plan in the coming weeks, although it is widely expected to be approved. The decision is likely to be controversial, however the IOC has also made it clear that the sporting sanctions against Russia and Belarus as countries will remain in place. It means neither is able to host international events – while Russian and Belarusian athletes are banned from wearing the colours of their country, or having their anthems played, when they compete in international competitions. Russian athletes who show overt support for the war in Ukraine will also be denied a chance to compete. In a statement the IOC accepted there had been an “intense debate” at its 11th Olympic summit in Lausanne about the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. However it stressed that it wanted sport to continue to be a place where athletes from many different countries and political systems could come together. Read the full story here: Vladimir Putin said Russia would probably have to reach agreements regarding Ukraine in the future, but was wary of doing so following the Minsk agreements. Germany and France brokered ceasefire agreements in the Belarusian capital Minsk between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and 2015. Putin said the two countries had betrayed Russia, as they were now pumping Ukraine with weapons. The then German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said in an interview published in Germany’s Zeit magazine on Wednesday that the Minsk agreements had been an attempt to “give Ukraine time” to build up its defences. Putin said he was “disappointed” by Merkel’s comments. In his news conference today, Vladimir Putin vaguely acknowledged that there had been some problems supplying equipment and clothes to the 300,000 men who were conscripted to fight in Ukraine in recent months. He acknowledged the problem by saying that some of these issues were now easing. When a reporter asked Vladimir Putin for comment on a Russian court sentencing opposition politician Ilya Yashin to eight and a half years in prison for opposing the invasion of Ukraine, Putin responded: “Who is Yashin?” Putin continued by saying it was wrong to doubt a court’s decision. The official charge against Yashin was for spreading false information meant to discredit the Russian army. But Yashin was one of a small group of vocal opponents to the war who chose not to leave the country, saying earlier this year that he believed that “anti-war voices sound louder and more convincing if the person remains in Russia”. “I must remain in Russia, I must speak the truth loudly, and I must stop the bloodshed at any cost,” he said in a courtroom speech this week. “It physically pains me to think how many people have been killed in this war, how many lives have been ruined, and how many families have lost their homes. You cannot be indifferent. And I swear I do not regret anything.” Read more about Yashin here: Vladimir Putin has been speaking at a news conference in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, where he said further prisoner swaps between the US and Russia were possible. He has also vowed to wipe from the face of the earth any country that dared to attack Russia with nuclear weapons, and said there was no need to call up additional troops to fight in Ukraine. We’ll bring you more lines from the Russian leader’s news conference shortly. Ukraine’s state-run power agency, Energoatom, has accused Russian forces of abducting two senior Ukrainian staff at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-eastern Ukraine and detaining a third person. Energoatom said the two abducted members of staff were beaten before being driven off in an “unknown direction” on Thursday. A third worker, who was detained, was responsible for safety at the plant, it said. In a statement, it said: Through such actions, the occupiers are trying to gain loyalty from the courageous pro-Ukrainian staff ... Nevertheless, the invaders fail to do so because the personnel resist. Ukraine has accused Russia of putting pressure on Ukrainian employees at the plant, which was captured by Moscow’s troops soon after the invasion, to sign contracts with Russia’s nuclear energy company. It has not been possible to independently verify these claims. Earlier we reported that representatives from Russia and the US were meeting in Istanbul to discuss “difficult questions”. That meeting has finished and did not involve discussions about the war in Ukraine, according to a US embassy spokesperson. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, was cited by state-run media as saying that the meeting was between heads of department from the Russian foreign ministry and the US state department. He said it was a technical meeting and should not be seen as a sign the two sides were ready to resume discussing “major issues”. A US embassy spokesperson confirmed the meeting and said “a senior official from the state department was in Istanbul to meet with Russian interlocutors on a narrow set of bilateral issues”. They added: Russia’s war in Ukraine was not discussed. Russia has told Zambia it pardoned a Zambian student to go and fight in Ukraine, where he was killed, according to the Zambian foreign affairs minister, Stanley Kakubo. Zambia has demanded answers over the death of Lemekhani Nyirenda, a 23-year-old Zambian citizen, after Russia announced he had been killed on the battlefield in Ukraine in September. Kakubo said Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told him by telephone that Nyirenda was pardoned on 23 August to fight in Ukraine, in exchange for an amnesty. He said: We were informed that Russia allows for prisoners to be provided an opportunity for pardon in exchange for participation in the special military operation. Nyirenda’s father said he was “conscripted” to fight while serving nine years in a jail on the outskirts of Moscow for a drug offence. The Moscow Engineering Physics Institute student was working as a part-time courier when an unknown person handed him a package containing drugs, his father told Reuters. Kakubo said Nyirenda’s remains had arrived in Moscow on Friday and were expected in Zambia on Sunday. He added that Russia had told Zambia that money owed to Nyirenda, together with all the documentation relating to his amnesty, recruitment and death, would be handed to a Zambian representative who would accompany the body. Russian businessman and Putin ally, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said last month that Nyirenda had been fighting for his Wagner private military group. Russia has offered freedom to some prisoners in exchange for fighting in its war in Ukraine. A Russian court has sentenced the opposition politician Ilya Yashin to eight and a half years in prison, in the most high-profile case to date of a Russian dissident being jailed for opposing the invasion of Ukraine. A veteran of Russia’s anti-Putin opposition, Yashin was one of a small group of vocal opponents to the war who chose not to leave the country, saying earlier this year that he believed that “anti-war voices sound louder and more convincing if the person remains in Russia”. In a courtroom speech this week, Yashin said: I must remain in Russia, I must speak the truth loudly, and I must stop the bloodshed at any cost. It physically pains me to think how many people have been killed in this war, how many lives have been ruined, and how many families have lost their homes. You cannot be indifferent. And I swear I do not regret anything. He added: It’s better to spend 10 years behind bars as an honest man than quietly burn with shame over the blood spilled by your government. Yashin joins a small group of other prominent dissenters who have been imprisoned for speaking out against the war. In July, a Russian city councillor was sentenced to seven years in prison after he spoke critically of a children’s drawing contest. “What kind of children’s drawing contest can we talk about for Children’s Day … when we have children dying every day?” he had said, the key piece of evidence against him in the trial. Vladimir Kara-Murza, another veteran opposition member, has also been charged with spreading false information about the army. Some media reports say he has also been charged with treason. Read the full story here: Representatives from Russia and the US are meeting in Istanbul today to discuss “difficult questions”, the Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported. The two sides are set to discuss “irritants” in bilateral relations including visas, embassy staffing levels and the work of each side’s institutions and agencies abroad, among other unspecified issues, the report said. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, confirmed the meeting during a discussion in Moscow. He was cited by Tass as saying: Yes, it is true that a meeting is being held today in Istanbul at the level of the directors of relevant departments. In principle, this event is held periodically to discuss so-called irritants in bilateral relations. After a certain pause, we resumed communication with the Americans in person on this issue. The allusion to “irritants” means that they are discussing the technicalities of how the US diplomatic missions in Russia and Russian ones in the US function. A senior Orthodox Christian cleric has been accused of engaging in anti-Ukrainian activity by supporting Russian policies in social media posts, Ukraine’s security service (SBU) said. In a statement, it said an archbishop in a diocese in western Ukraine had distributed posts that “humiliated the national honour and dignity of Ukrainians” and “contributed to the incitement of religious enmity and hatred”, Reuters reports. The cleric, who was not named, was accused of using an anonymous profile on Facebook to spread “narratives of Russian propagandists”. The SBU’s statement followed a series of raids of property used by a Ukrainian branch of the Orthodox church, including the 1,000-year-old Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex, as part of operations to counter suspected “subversive activities by Russian special services”. A spokesperson for the church said last week that it had always acted within the framework of Ukrainian law and that the state had no legal grounds to put pressure on its followers. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he would speak to his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts in order to strengthen the UN-backed Black Sea grain deal. Erdoğan said he would speak to Vladimir Putin on Saturday, and Volodymyr Zelenskiy separately, during an address at a conference in Istanbul today. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. The jailed Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has described the sentencing of Ilya Yashin as “another shameless and lawless verdict” that will not silence his long-time ally. In a series of tweets, Navalny said he had known Yashin since he was a teenager and that he was “proud” of his friend. A Moscow court has sentenced opposition politician Ilya Yashin to eight and a half years in prison for spreading “fake information” about the Russian army. Yashin, 39, was found guilty of spreading “false information” on a YouTube video released in April in which he discussed evidence uncovered by western journalists of Russian war crimes in Bucha, near Kyiv. In the video, the Kremlin critic and former municipal deputy cast doubt on the official Moscow version that such reports had been fabricated as a “provocation” against Russia. Sentencing him, the judge, Oksana Goryunova of the Meshchansky district court, said Yashin had committed a crime by disseminating “knowingly false information about Russia’s armed forces”. In his final statement to the court this week, Yashin appealed directly to President Vladimir Putin, describing him as “the person responsible for this slaughter” and asking him to “stop this madness”. He said: As if they will sew my mouth shut and I would be forbidden to speak forever. Everyone understands that this is the point. He added: I am isolated from society because they want me to be silent. I promise as long as I’m alive I’ll never will be. My mission is to tell the truth. I will not give up the truth even behind bars. After all, quoting the classic: ‘Lie is the religion of slaves.’ An ally of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, Yashin is one of hundreds of Russians to face prosecution under new laws that criminalise disseminating information about Russia’s military operation in Ukraine that clash with the Kremlin’s narrative. Moscow and Washington will continue to talk about possible prisoner swaps directly, without intermediaries, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, was cited by the state-owned news agency Ria Novosti as saying. President Joe Biden yesterday expressed regret that the US had not been able to secure the release of the detained American, Paul Whelan, after news that Brittney Griner had been freed as part of a prisoner exchange for the arms dealer Viktor Bout. Biden said: For totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up. When Nazar and his fellow soldiers came to the village outside the key city of Bakhmut that they had been ordered to attack, they thought they would be there for a single day. They arrived without sleeping bags or extra rations, as snow lay on the ground. Instead of the 15 Russians they had been warned to expect, they encountered 50 of them, dug into the tree line, triggering a fight that lasted several days. “In places we were only 100 metres apart,” recalls Nazar. We were on one low hill and they were on another. Sometimes, we could even hear their laughter. For the 19-year-old machine gunner in the 24th mechanised brigade, it was his first fight since finishing his training. For many of the other soldiers in this battalion, however, it was only the latest in a series of battles that has seen them fight in the Donbas region in Popasna, in the battle for Kherson and then around Bakhmut, the embattled eastern city that is currently the war’s most violent front. Even 5 miles (8km) from Bakhmut, back from the frontlines, the sound of heavy rockets and artillery is constant in a frozen landscape where all the roads are covered in a glazing of sheet ice. It is here on this frontline that the Russians have spent almost six months trying to break through to reach the cities of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and Konstantinovka in warfare that is being fought from frigid muddy trenches, and where the combatants must now slog through the fields and the dense woods of Ukraine’s east. While there are still civilians in towns and villages surrounding Bakhmut, a city under attack from two directions that was once home to 72,0000 people, evidence of the scale of the continuing battle is everywhere. Read the full story here: The notorious arms dealer, Viktor Bout, has spoken in an interview following his release from US detention in a prisoner exchange for the basketball star, Brittney Griner. Speaking to the Russian state-run news outlet RT, Bout said it was difficult to find the words to describe his feelings after being freed. He added that he had not encountered much anti-Russian sentiment during his imprisonment in the US, and claimed that many of his fellow prisoners had sympathies with Moscow. Nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, Bout is a former Soviet lieutenant colonel who the US justice department once described as one of the world’s most prolific arms dealers. He was serving a 25-year sentence for conspiring to sell tens of millions of dollars in weapons US officials said were to be used against Americans. His wife, Alla Bout, said he felt terrible and “exhausted” after his long prisoner swap journey and hadn’t slept for three days, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. She was quoted as saying: Viktor Anatolyevich feels terrible, he is really exhausted. She added that she hoped the US will hand over his documents and drawings to the Russian embassy, adding that she was grateful for how the Americans treated her husband during the exchange. She said: He said he was grateful to the American side for feeding him. He said he hasn’t eaten as much for the last 12 years. He was treated well, with respect, he wasn’t shackled or in handcuffs. A plane carrying the US basketball star, Brittney Griner, has landed in the US. Griner was freed in a prisoner exchange after nearly 10 months of detention in Russia. The two-time Olympic gold medalist was swapped for for the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. Russian forces have shelled the “entire front line” in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, has said. The fiercest fighting was near the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, Reuters quotes him as saying in an interview on Friday. Five civilians were killed and two injured in Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk over the previous day, he said. He added that Russian troops were also trying to advance near Lyman, which was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in November. In Bakhmut and other parts of the Donetsk region neighbouring the Luhansk province, Ukraine countered with barrages from rocket launchers, a witness said. Kyiv’s forces attacked Russian positions and troop assembly points in at least half a dozen towns in the south of Ukraine, Ukraine’s general staff said in an update this morning. Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said in a social media post: The Russians have intensified their efforts in Donetsk and Luhansk. They are now in a very active phase of attempting to conduct offensive operations. We are advancing nowhere but, rather, defending, destroying the enemy’s infantry and equipment wherever it tries to advance. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Vivian Ho to bring you the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Russian forces have installed multiple rocket launchers at Ukraine’s shut-down Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, raising fears that Europe’s largest atomic power station could be used as a base to fire on Ukrainian territory and heightening radiation dangers. This comes as the UK Ministry of Defence says in its latest intelligence report that Russia has likely received a resupply of Iranian Shahed-131 and 136 loitering munitions, with new reports over the past three weeks of attacks involving these devices. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian general staff reported shooting down at least 14 Shahed-136s, while on Wednesday, Ukrainian officials reported the use of Iranian-provided one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicles to attack the Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro oblasts. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has announced in today’s Guardian that he will place new sanctions on 2,000 individuals and 400 entities across the world with connections to the Kremlin. “We are right to express our horror and revulsion, but our words will always count for more when they are backed by action,” Cleverly wrote. “I will ensure this remains the theme of British diplomacy. We are not passive observers and we should not merely voice our feelings: we will use our country’s leverage to make a difference.” In that same vein, the US is set to levy fresh sanctions against Russia and China on Friday, according to the Wall Street Journal reports, with measures intended on targeting Russia’s deployment of Iranian drones in Ukraine, as well as alleged human-rights abuses by Russia. The war’s most violent front is currently situated in the area of Bakhmut, an embattled city in the eastern Donetsk region. Here, three civilians died yesterday, with one more killed in Toretsk and another in Netailovo. Meanwhile in Moscow, firefighters are battling a blaze the size of a football pitch at a shopping centre. However, the suspected cause of the fire is arson and authorities currently believe it has nothing to do with Ukraine. After almost months in Russian detention, US basketball star Brittney Griner was freed in a dramatic high-level prisoner exchange for the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, the so-called “Merchant of Death” who had been held in a US prison for 12 years. Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was arrested in February at a Moscow airport after Russian authorities said they found vape canisters with cannabis oil in her luggage. She pleaded guilty in July, saying in court that she had no criminal intent and the canisters’ presence in her luggage was due to hasty packing. Her family and supporters repeatedly decried the charges against her as politically motivated; in May, the US designated her as unlawfully detained. Here is video of the prisoner exchange in Abu Dhabi: Russian landmines continue to put Ukrainian lives at risk, with civilians attempting to return to some form of normalcy in some areas, only to find that danger still persists. Now almost 10 months into the invasion, more than a fourth of the country needs to be checked for mines. Volodymyr Zelenskiy last night paid tribute to four policemen killed by landmines in the Kherson oblast, calling the landmines left behind by Russian troops “perhaps even fiercer and more devious than missile terror”. Ukrainian and Russian forces are now battling it out in the Donetsk region, with the embattled city of Bakhmut seeing the most violence and fighting. “In places we were only 100 metres apart,” one Ukrainian soldier recalled, of a days-long skirmish in a village outside of Bakhmut. “We were on one low hill and they were on another. Sometimes, we could even hear their laughter.” The Guardian’s Peter Beaumont has more from what is now currently the war’s most violent front: Ukraine’s ministry of defence believes that up to 310 Russian soldiers were killed in Ukraine yesterday: A 40-year-old man has died of injuries sustained in yesterday’s rocket attacks on the Kharkiv oblast, Vasily Golubev, the region’s governor, said on Telegram. Russian forces injured three others after launching rocket and artillery strikes on the Kupyan, Kharkiv, Chuguyiv and Izyum districts, damaging houses and cars. Russian shelling burned down the warehouses of a food enterprise in the city of Kupyansk, The Guardian’s chief culture writer, Charlotte Higgins, went on the Guardian’s Today in Focus to discuss how the war has changed Ukraine’s culture while Ukrainian artist Oleksiy Sai talked to the Guardian’s Hannah Moore about how he sees the work he produces not as art, but a tactical weapon. Here are some of the latest images we have received from around Ukraine: From the Guardian’s chief culture writer, Charlotte Higgins: I spent two eventful weeks in Ukraine in October, punctuated by major cruise missile attacks on Kyiv and then the start of the current campaign of drone attacks on energy infrastructure. Happily that didn’t stop me undertaking the reporting I had gone there to do – which was talking to artists – poets, playwrights, dancers, composers, visual artists, musicians – about how they were using their work in all kinds of ways during the current conflict as a means of resistance. Sometimes that means refusing to stop working – the National Opera of Ukraine, for example, reopened soon after the Russian withdrawal from Kyiv as an amazing symbol of resilience. Other artists have used their skills as part of the war effort, producing campaigning work that sits on the edge of propaganda, aimed at a western audience; others have found themselves recording, witnessing and testifying through their writing; others have found moving and poetic ways to respond to the violence and rupture that war brings. All of this is against the backdrop of Putin’s insistence that Ukraine does not have a culture of its own, but exists only in relation to Russia – meaning the underlying motivation for the invasion is, in the end, about identity and culture. Here, I explore the surprising and fascinating upsurge in Ukrainian poetry engendered by the war. In its latest intelligence report, the UK Ministry of Defence says Russia has likely received a resupply of Iranian Shahed-131 and 136 loitering munitions, with new reports over the past three weeks of attacks involving these devices. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian general staff reported shooting down at least 14 Shahed-136s, while on Wednesday, Ukrainian officials reported the use of Iranian-provided one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicles to attack the Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro oblasts. The last reported takedown of a Shahed-136 in Ukraine was on 17 November. Russian forces shelled the region of Kherson 68 times yesterday, targeting residential homes and apartment buildings, said Yaroslav Yanushevych, the regional governor. Eight civilians were injured in the attacks. Five civilians were killed in Russian attacks on the Donetsk oblast yesterday, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the Donetsk oblast, said in his morning update on casualties. Three were killed in the besieged city of Bakhmut, one in Toretsk and another in Netailovo. Two more were injured, Kyrylenko said. The US is set to levy fresh sanctions against Russia and China on Friday, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing officials familiar with the matter. The measures will target Russia’s deployment of Iranian drones in Ukraine, as well as alleged human-rights abuses by Russia. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has announced in today’s Guardian that he will place new sanctions on individuals in Russia. In an opinion piece titled, “Britain is not a passive observer on the world stage. We want oligarchs and dictators to fear us”, Cleverly writes: After Vladimir Putin launched his latest onslaught against Ukraine in February, the UK put together the biggest package of sanctions ever enacted against a major economy. So far we have targeted over 1,200 Russian individuals, including at least 100 oligarchs and their families, with a net worth exceeding £140bn. We’ve hit whole sectors of the Russian economy, immobilising Russian central bank reserves, preventing Russian companies from raising funds in the City of London, and placing UK financial services beyond the Kremlin’s reach. Together with allies, our sanctions have undermined Russia’s ability to wage war. Today, I will announce new sanctions on individuals in 11 countries, including Iran, Russia, Mali and Nicaragua, targeting those responsible for acts of torture, sexual violence and the repression of protests. Meanwhile in Moscow, firefighters are battling a blaze the size of a football pitch at a shopping centre, emergency services say. The fire broke out overnight at the Mega Khimki mall in the northern suburb of Khimki. The suspected cause of the fire is arson, according to authorities, and there were no immediate reports of casualties. Mega had been home to a large number of western retail chains before the companies’ departure from Russiaamid the Ukraine conflict, including one of the first Ikea stores in the area. In his late Thursday video address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenksiy, paid tribute to four policemen killed by landmines in Kherson province. “This is perhaps even fiercer and more devious than missile terror,” said Zelenksiy. “For there is no system against mines that could destroy at least part of the threat as our anti-aircraft systems do.” He accused Russian forces of leaving landmines, tripwire mines, mined buildings, cars and infrastructure in places they abandoned under Ukrainian military pressure. Russian forces have installed multiple rocket launchers at Ukraine’s shut-down Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials claimed Thursday, raising fears Europe’s largest atomic power station could be used as a base to fire on Ukrainian territory and heightening radiation dangers. Ukraine’s nuclear company Energoatom said in a statement that Russian forces occupying the plant have placed several Grad multiple rocket launchers near one of its six nuclear reactors. It said the offensive systems are located at new “protective structures” the Russians secretly built, “violating all conditions for nuclear and radiation safety.” The claims have not been verified by the Guardian. Although the risk of a nuclear meltdown is greatly reduced because all six reactors have been shut down, experts have said a dangerous release of radiation is still possible, the Associated Press reports. This is the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Our top story this morning is that Russian forces have installed multiple rocket launchers at Ukraine’s shut-down Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials claimed Thursday, raising fears Europe’s largest atomic power station could be used as a base to fire on Ukrainian territory and heightening radiation dangers. We’ll have more on this shortly. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments: US basketball star Brittney Griner has been released in a prisoner swap with Russia in exchange for former arms dealer Viktor Bout and was heading back to the United States on Thursday, ending what President Joe Biden called months of “hell” for her and her wife. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Thursday the United States is confident that Finland and Sweden will be approved soon for membership of Nato despite ratification delays from members Turkey and Hungary. After meeting his Finnish and Swedish counterparts on Thursday, Blinken said both countries had proved their bona fides to join the alliance, most notably in joining Nato to provide support to Ukraine to counter Russia’s invasion. Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukrainian energy systems despite global criticism of strikes that have left millions without electricity and water at the start of winter. The Russian leader presented the strikes as a response to the explosion on Moscow’s bridge that connected Russia to annexed Crimea, as well as other attacks, accusing Kyiv of blowing up power lines near the Kursk nuclear power plant and not supplying water to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Russia is still set on seizing parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that Putin claimed as his own, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. He added that the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Russia annexed in 2014, was vulnerable to attacks by Ukrainian forces, after officials there said they had shot down a drone near a key naval base. The United States is preparing to send Ukraine a $275m military aid package offering new capabilities to defeat drones and strengthen air defenses, according to a document seen by Reuters on Thursday and people familiar with the package. Russian shelling of a town in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine has left one person dead and two injured, according to the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. At least 12 houses were destroyed by the shelling in the town of Toretsk, he said in a Telegram post. About 10,000 Ukrainian service personnel and roughly the same number of Ukrainian civilians are believed to be being held in Russian detention facilities, according to a Ukrainian official. Oleksandr Kononenko, who oversees human rights in the security and defence sector on behalf of Ukraine’s parliament, said the civilians were being detained illegally as prisoners of war because of their alleged association with the Ukrainian army or state. Russian forces have fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid during the war. The grid is still working despite taking major damage, a senior official said. Volodymyr Kudrytsky, the chief executive of the grid operator Ukrenergo, also told a meeting arranged by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that his officials were scouring the world for the complex equipment needed for repairs. Ukraine has introduced new emergency power cuts as it tries to repair energy infrastructure damaged in Russian airstrikes. The grid operator Ukrenergo said the situation was complicated by the weather, with western regions facing frost, rain, snow and strong winds that were causing wires to ice over, but the most difficult situation was in eastern areas, where fighting has been fiercest. Russian troops are reportedly taking part in tactical exercises in Belarus, according to the Russian defence ministry. Video clips posted by the ministry showed Russian soldiers in snow gear training near tanks in a winter landscape, firing weapons including artillery. The EU plans to tighten up sanctions on Russia’s military and industrial complex, pro-Kremlin media and Russian nationalist groups fighting in Ukraine, according to leaked papers. A total of eight individuals are facing personal sanctions, including Russian officials said to be involved in the illegal transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children in Russia, as well as the leaders of rightwing nationalist groups.

Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus Energy, said his company did not know yet how much bills would rise in the run-up to 7 February, the deadline for when the regulator Ofgem sets a new cap on what suppliers can charge customers. The record wholesale gas prices across Europe has led to forecasts that average annual bills in the UK could leap from £1,277 to more than £2,000 when the cap comes into effect in April. Jackson said talks between energy suppliers and the government would have to find a way to avoid global gas prices being passed directly on to consumers. “We’ve got to recognise that as a result of the pandemic, every sector is asking the Treasury for help and there’s not an infinite supply of money,” he said. “The reality is that the UK buys most of its energy on a global market and we’ve had to pay about £20bn more than usual this year. So, in some way or another, the UK is going to have to pay that money.” Octopus, a renewable energy provider, is one of the fastest-growing companies in the sector, with 3.1m customers. It has been at the heart of industry talks with business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who is said to be determined to avoid bailing out large energy companies. Jackson has been a leading proponent of an alternative £20bn loan scheme, under which a commercial lender makes a fund available that suppliers can dip into in order to refrain from hitting customers with sudden hikes in their energy bills. The suppliers could then pay the lender back over time with the money they make from staggered price increases, cushioning the blow to household finances. Jackson said the sector should explore the plan, which may need government oversight but not necessarily any state funding, “before we go looking for help from the public purse or elsewhere”. “The energy sector has always had large access to private finance,” he added. Asked whether a windfall tax should be imposed on North Sea oil companies that have made money from higher gas prices to help fund lower bills, Jackson refused to dismiss the idea. He added that it should be separate from broader efforts to reduce household bills. The expectation of rising gas bills adds to wider fears that 2022 will be characterised by a massive squeeze on the cost of living that could push more people into poverty and upend British politics. UK households face a hit of £1,200 this year, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, with more expensive energy bills piled on top of rising taxes and the effect of stalling wage increases."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/russia-oligarchs-business-figures-west-sanction-lists-us-eu-uk-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-10T15:38:23Z","webTitle":"Russia: the oligarchs and business figures on western sanction lists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-oligarchs-business-figures-west-sanction-lists-us-eu-uk-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-oligarchs-business-figures-west-sanction-lists-us-eu-uk-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Russia: the oligarchs and business figures on western sanction lists","bodyText":"Dozens of prominent oligarchs have been punished by western governments in retaliation over the invasion of Ukraine.

Guterres, on his second visit to Ukraine since the Russian invasion, joined the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, for meetings and then a press conference in the western city of Lviv. “We are worried. We don’t want another Chernobyl,” Erdoğan said. It was the first visit to Ukraine by Turkey’s leader, who has been a key intermediary in negotiations with Russia. Zelenskiy said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. It was taken over by Russian forces in March but is still being run by Ukrainians. The UN chief called on Russian forces to leave with their military equipment, amid fears that fighting around the site could lead to a deadly disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have traded accusations of shelling the site. “The facility must not be used as part of any military operation. Instead, agreement is urgently needed to re-establish Zaporizhzhia’s purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of the area,” Guterres said. Video footage shared online by a New York Times reporter showed at least five apparently military trucks parked inside the plant’s engine room near the turbo generator. In the hours before the international summit in western Ukraine, Russia announced it had deployed warplanes armed with hypersonic missiles to its Kaliningrad region, an enclave on the Baltic Sea that borders the EU and Nato members Poland and Lithuania. The commander of its Black Sea fleet has also been replaced, the Russian RIA news agency said, in one of the most high-profile military sackings since the invasion. It came after a series of humiliations for the fleet, including the sinking of its flagship Moskva cruiser and an attack on a key airbase in Crimea. Inside Ukraine, Russian forces stepped up attacks on Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city, ahead of the summit in Lviv. In attacks overnight and early on Thursday morning, at least 11 people were killed and more than 40 injured and a residential block was destroyed. Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. Russian state media had already accused Ukraine of planning a “provocation” at the plant to coincide with the UN leader’s trip, raising fears that Russia’s military could be planning a “false-flag attack”. When Guterres travelled to Kyiv in April, Moscow carried out an airstrike on the city. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, said Ukraine must “prepare for all scenarios”, during a drill for emergency workers in Zaporizhzhia. On Wednesday, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned Russia’s seizure of the plant had “raised the risk of a nuclear accident or incident” and accused Moscow of being “reckless” by using the area as a staging platform to launch artillery attacks on Ukrainian forces. Russia said it may shut down the plant, claiming backup support systems had been damaged in strikes. Igor Kirillov, the head of the radioactive, chemical and biological defence force, said if there was an accident at the site, radioactive material would cover Poland, Germany and Slovenia. Ukraine’s hydrometeorological institute also warned of contamination spreading across Europe, a BBC journalist reported. Two issues are causing deepening anxiety about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant. International nuclear safety officials have become concerned over the lack of spare parts, access for routine maintenance of the reactors, and contact with staff, all of which have been disrupted by the conflict. A second issue is shelling around the plant. According to Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear authority, the impacts from Grad missiles earlier this month were close to the spent fuel storage area, with the plant’s operator claiming Russian troops “aimed specifically” at the containers, despite the Russian military’s presence at the site. Russia accuses Ukraine of carrying out the shelling. On Friday, Guterres will travel to the Black Sea port of Odesa, a crucial gateway for Ukrainian grain to reach the rest of the world. He will then continue to Turkey to visit the Joint Coordination Centre, the body tasked with overseeing the accord. Ukraine’s fields feed hundreds of millions of people worldwide, so the abrupt halt to shipments has pushed up global grain prices at a time when famine is already threatening east Africa. The UN last month brokered an agreement to let shipments restart. So far, 24 ships have left Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, a monitoring group said. Kyiv has a backlog of 18m tonnes of grain from last year’s harvest, even as it starts bringing in the 2022 crop. It hopes to soon raise exports to 3m tonnes a month, easing world prices and clearing storage space for new grain. It will be six months on 24 August since the start of the invasion – which Russia calls a “special military operation” – and several UN security council members, including the US, Britain, the Republic of Ireland and Norway, have called for a meeting on that date. Kyiv is expected to launch a counteroffensive in southern Ukraine in the coming weeks and has carried out spectacular attacks deep inside Russian-held territory, including on an airbase in Crimea. But despite shipments of western weapons and ammunition, Ukraine is still struggling against heavy Russian artillery bombardment along the eastern front. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video on Wednesday that the war had reached a “strategic deadlock”. “Russian forces have achieved only minimal advances, and in some cases we have advanced, since last month,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-us-denounces-putins-loose-talk-on-nuclear-weapons-zelenskiy-reports-fierce-fighting-in-bakhmut","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-08T18:45:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv ‘working with UN to demilitarise Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-us-denounces-putins-loose-talk-on-nuclear-weapons-zelenskiy-reports-fierce-fighting-in-bakhmut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-us-denounces-putins-loose-talk-on-nuclear-weapons-zelenskiy-reports-fierce-fighting-in-bakhmut","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv ‘working with UN to demilitarise Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant’ – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s coming up to 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukrainian energy systems despite global criticism of strikes that have left millions without electricity and water at the start of winter. The Russian leader presented the strikes as a response to a blast on Moscow’s bridge to annexed Crimea and other attacks, accusing Kyiv of blowing up power lines from the Kursk nuclear power plant and not supplying water to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Russia is still set on seizing parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that Putin claimed as his own, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. He added that the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Russia annexed in 2014, was vulnerable to attacks by Ukrainian forces, after officials there said they had shot down a drone near a key naval base. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said his government was working with the UN’s nuclear watchdog agency to create a safety zone around the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Kyiv remained “in close contact” with Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), he said at a joint press conference with his Slovak counterpart, Rastislav Káčer, in Kyiv. Russia has claimed that its proposed safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is to “stop Ukrainian shelling”. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, also said the US’s withdrawal from a treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles was a “destructive” act that created a vacuum and stoked additional security risks. Russian shelling of a town in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine has left one person dead and two injured, according to the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. At least 12 houses were destroyed by the shelling in the town of Toretsk, he said in a Telegram post. About 10,000 Ukrainian service personnel and roughly the same number of Ukrainian civilians are believed to be being held in Russian detention facilities, according to a Ukrainian official. Oleksandr Kononenko, who oversees human rights in the security and defence sector on behalf of Ukraine’s parliament, said the civilians were being detained illegally as prisoners of war because of their alleged association with the Ukrainian army or state. Explosions have been reported at Berdiansk airbase in the Zaporizhzhia region. Three large explosions were heard, as well as smaller ones, near the city on the coast of the Sea of Azov. Russian forces have fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid, which is still working despite taking major damage, a senior official said. Volodymyr Kudrytsky, the chief executive of the grid operator Ukrenergo, also told a meeting arranged by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that his officials were scouring the world for the complex equipment needed for repairs. Ukraine has introduced new emergency power cuts as it tried to repair energy infrastructure damaged in Russian airstrikes, which the national grid operator said had caused significant supply shortages. The grid operator Ukrenergo said the situation was complicated by the weather, with western regions facing frost, rain, snow and strong winds that were causing wires to ice over, but the most difficult situation was in eastern areas, where fighting has been fiercest. Russian troops are reportedly taking part in tactical exercises in Belarus, according to the Russian defence ministry. Video clips posted by the ministry showed Russian soldiers in snow gear training near tanks in a winter landscape, firing weapons including artillery. Russia freed the jailed US basketball star Brittney Griner on Thursday in a high-level prisoner exchange for the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, who had been held in a US prison for 12 years. Joe Biden, who had made Griner’s release a top priority after she spent almost 10 months in jail on drugs charges, said in an address from the White House that he had spoken with Griner and found her “in good spirits”. The mother of Viktor Bout has thanked Vladimir Putin for her son’s release as part of a swap with the US. Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, is a former Soviet lieutenant colonel whom the US justice department once described as one of the world’s most prolific arms dealers. Russian state media reported that he had arrived back in the country. Biden expressed regret that the deal did not include Paul Whelan, an American jailed since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the US government say are baseless. An anonymous US official told CNN that leaving Whelan out of the deal had been “a difficult decision” but “it was a choice to get Brittney or nothing”. The EU plans to tighten up sanctions on Russia’s military and industrial complex, pro-Kremlin media and Russian nationalist groups fighting in Ukraine, according to leaked papers. A total of eight individuals are facing personal sanctions, including Russian officials said to be involved in the illegal transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children in Russia, as well as the leaders of rightwing nationalist groups. Pope Francis broke down and wept as he prayed for peace in Ukraine during a traditional Christmas visit to the Spanish Steps in Rome. Reuters reports that Francis had to stop speaking and was unable to continue for about 30 seconds, and his head trembled. He later tweeted that “peace is possible; disarmament is possible”. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine, including of the village of Posad-Pokrovske, in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region. The notorious arms dealer, Viktor Bout, has arrived back in Russia after his release from US detention in a prisoner swap with Brittney Griner, Russian state media reported. The White House has said the grant of clemency for Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, was not approved until today. Russian shelling of a town in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine has left one person dead and two injured, according to the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. At least 12 houses were destroyed by the shelling in the town of Toretsk, he said in a Telegram post. Kyrylenko wrote: 1 person was killed, 2 more were wounded in artillery shelling of Toretsk. Shells hit a private sector, destroying and damaging at least 12 houses. The Russians are again cynically shelling civilians — they are continuing their terror tactics. The mother of the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout has thanked Vladimir Putin for her son’s release as part of a swap with the US. Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, is a former Soviet lieutenant colonel whom the US justice department once described as one of the world’s most prolific arms dealers. He was serving a 25-year sentence for conspiring to sell tens of millions of dollars worth of weapons that US officials said were to be used against Americans. He was released from US detention in a prisoner swap for the American basketball star Brittney Griner. He is expected to arrive in Moscow shortly. The release happened “thanks to our president”, Raisa Bout said in televised remarks reported by AFP. She said: I am so grateful. A low maternal bow to the Russian foreign ministry with Lavrov Sergei Viktorovich at its helm. She said she was also grateful to “kind people” in the US, adding: “You cannot say that all of them are evil.” Russia’s human rights commissioner, Tatiana Moskalkova, described Bout as a “wonderful man who has become a victim of American insinuations”. The US basketball star Brittney Griner has been released from a Russian jail and is on her way back to the US, President Joe Biden said. The Russian foreign ministry said it had traded Griner for Viktor Bout, a notorious arms dealer who had been held in a US prison for 12 years. The swap took place at an airport in Abu Dhabi, Russian news agencies reported. Griner, 32, a two-time Olympic gold medallist, was arrested on 17 February. Talks to secure her release were complicated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February and the subsequent souring of ties between Washington and Moscow. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said his government was working with the UN’s nuclear watchdog agency to create a safety zone around the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Kyiv remained “in close contact” with Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), he said at a joint press conference with his Slovak counterpart, Rastislav Káčer, in Kyiv. Kuleba said: Of course, we are all interested in ensuring that all nuclear power plants, not only the Zaporizhzhia NPP, are safe. This is extremely difficult to achieve without stopping Russian missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine, but we are moving forward step by with mutual understanding with the IAEA. There is a rule in diplomacy that nothing is agreed upon until everything is agreed. Ukraine’s state nuclear energy firm Energoatom earlier today repeated Kyiv’s claims that Russia was using the site as a de facto weapons depot. Energoatom said Russia had brought multiple rocket launchers to the site and stationed them near the plant’s power unit No 6. It went on to claim that Russian forces planned to use them to launch attacks against Ukrainian positions and bridges on the western bank of the Dnipro River. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has come under repeated shelling since Moscow seized it shortly after launching its invasion in February, prompting the IAEA to call for a demilitarised safety zone around the plant. Earlier, we reported that Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukraine’s energy grid and presented the strikes as a response to the explosion on Moscow’s bridge to annexed Crimea in October. “Yes, we do that,” Putin said of the strikes on the Ukraine grid. “But who started it?” Here’s a clip of Putin speaking while attending a military awards ceremony in the Kremlin today: Pope Francis broke down and wept as he prayed for peace in Ukraine during a traditional Christmas visit to the Spanish Steps in Rome. The pope’s voice began to tremble as he mentioned the suffering of Ukrainians. He said: I would have liked to have brought you the thanks of the Ukrainian people … Reuters reports that Francis had to stop speaking and was unable to continue for about 30 seconds, and his head trembled. The crowd, which included the mayor of Rome, Roberto Gualtieri, applauded when they realised he was unable to talk and saw him crying. When he resumed the prayer, his voice was cracking. He continued: …the Ukrainian people for the peace we have so long asked the Lord. Instead I must present you with the pleas of children, elderly, mothers and fathers and the young people of that martyred land, that is suffering so much. He later tweeted that “peace is possible; disarmament is possible”. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukrainian energy systems despite global criticism of strikes that have left millions without electricity and water at the start of winter. The Russian leader presented the strikes as a response to a blast on Moscow’s bridge to annexed Crimea and other attacks, accusing Kyiv of blowing up power lines from the Kursk nuclear power plant and not supplying water to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine.

Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, also said the US’s withdrawal from a treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles was a “destructive” act that created a vacuum and stoked additional security risks. About 10,000 Ukrainian service personnel and roughly the same number of Ukrainian civilians are believed to be being held in Russian detention facilities, according to a Ukrainian official. Oleksandr Kononenko, who oversees human rights in the security and defence sector on behalf of Ukraine’s parliament, said the civilians were being detained illegally as prisoners of war because of their alleged association with the Ukrainian army or state. Explosions have been reported at Berdiansk airbase in the Zaporizhzhia region. Three large explosions were heard, as well as smaller ones, near the city on the coast of the Sea of Azov. Russian forces have fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid, which is still working despite taking major damage, a senior official said. Volodymyr Kudrytsky, the chief executive of the grid operator Ukrenergo, also told a meeting arranged by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that his officials were scouring the world for the complex equipment needed for repairs. Ukraine has introduced new emergency power cuts as it tried to repair energy infrastructure damaged in Russian airstrikes, which the national grid operator said had caused significant supply shortages. The grid operator Ukrenergo said the situation was complicated by the weather, with western regions facing frost, rain, snow and strong winds that were causing wires to ice over, but the most difficult situation was in eastern areas, where fighting has been fiercest. Russian troops are reportedly taking part in tactical exercises in Belarus, according to the Russian defence ministry. Video clips posted by the ministry showed Russian soldiers in snow gear training near tanks in a winter landscape, firing weapons including artillery. Russia freed the jailed US basketball star Brittney Griner on Thursday in a high-level prisoner exchange for the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, who had been held in a US prison for 12 years. Joe Biden, who had made Griner’s release a top priority after she spent almost 10 months in jail on drugs charges, said in an address from the White House that he had spoken with Griner and found her “in good spirits”. Biden expressed regret the deal did not include Paul Whelan, an American jailed since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the US government say are baseless. An anonymous US official told CNN that leaving Whelan out of the deal had been “a difficult decision” but “it was a choice to get Brittney or nothing”. The EU plans to tighten up sanctions on Russia’s military and industrial complex, pro-Kremlin media and Russian nationalist groups fighting in Ukraine, according to leaked papers. A total of eight individuals are facing personal sanctions, including Russian officials said to be involved in the illegal transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children in Russia, as well as the leaders of rightwing nationalist groups. Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, I’ll be bringing you all the latest global developments on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The commodities trading firm Trafigura is to hand more than $1.7bn to its top traders and shareholders after the energy crisis, fuelled by the war in Ukraine, led to a surge in profits. Trafigura, one of the world’s largest specialist commodity traders, posted a record $7bn net profit in its last financial year, more than the previous four years combined, after making gains from the market volatility caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Its chief financial officer, Christophe Salmon, hailed an “exceptionally strong year” as profits more than doubled and revenues grew to $318.5bn in the year to 30 September, up from $231.3bn a year earlier. The $1.71bn payout to its 1,100 shareholders, including top employees, equates to about $1.56m a head if shared equally. That’s an increase of about 35% compared with 2021’s dividend of $1.12bn to about 1,000 top traders and investors. Oil and gas companies, as well as some electricity generators, have faced windfall taxes as a result of the gains made since the invasion. However, politicians have not moved to curb the profits of commodity traders. Strong trading performances have boosted multinationals including the British oil firms BP and Shell. Read the full story here: Speaking earlier, Joe Biden said Russia was treating the case of the detained American Paul Whelan “differently” but that the US “will never give up” on securing his release. Biden said: Sadly and for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up. The Biden administration has offered Moscow multiple options to secure Whelan, a US official told journalists today. From the Washington Post’s John Hudson: And from Nick Schifrin from PBS: Explosions have been heard at Berdiansk airbase in the Zaporizhzhia region. Three large explosions were heard, as well as smaller ones, near the city on the coast of the Sea of Azov. Emergency services have been reported as making their way to the scene. No casualties have been reported. Russia has used the 35th anniversary of the historic signing of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) to criticise the US for withdrawing from the agreement in 2019. At the time, the then US president Donald Trump gave his reason for doing so as “developing our own military response options,” to Russia’s missiles. Nato allies later backed the US by issuing a statement attributing responsibility for the treaty’s demise to Russia. When the treaty was signed in 1987, the agreement between the US and the Soviet Union to reduce their nuclear arsenals was hailed by some commentators as a significant step towards a non-nuclear world. This is how the Guardian reported the historic event. Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukrainian energy systems despite global criticism of strikes that have left millions without electricity and water at the start of winter. “There’s a lot of noise about our strikes on the energy infrastructure of a neighbouring country. Yes, we do that. But who started it?” Putin said at an awards ceremony in the Kremlin, according to Agence France-Presse, adding that the criticism would “not interfere with our combat missions”. He presented the strikes as a response to a blast on Moscow’s bridge to annexed Crimea and other attacks, accusing Kyiv of blowing up power lines from the Kursk nuclear power plant and not supplying water to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. “Not supplying water to a city of more than a million people is an act of genocide,” Putin said. He accused the west of “complete silence” on this and of bias against Russia. “As soon as we move and do something in response, there is uproar and clamour spreading through the whole universe,” he said. Russia has faced claims that its attacks on Ukraine’s energy systems and infrastructure amount to war crimes. The EU plans to tighten up sanctions on Russia’s military and industrial complex, pro-Kremlin media and Russian nationalist groups fighting in Ukraine, according to leaked papers. The EU’s ninth set of restrictive measures on Russia since February’s invasion of Ukraine seek to close gaps in previous rounds, with further sanctions on 169 entities “which might contribute to the technological enhancement of Russia’s defence and security sector”, according to a draft text seen by the Guardian. These companies will face restrictions on their ability to buy from Europe so-called dual-use goods – civilian products that can be turned to military purposes. Previous EU sanctions have already imposed sweeping bans on hi-tech equipment, but this package adds items that were missed off the list such as generators, toy drones, laptops, cameras and lenses. According to a separate paper, four pro-Kremlin TV companies will lose their licence to broadcast in the EU, including NTV, Rossiya 1, Pervyi Kanal and REN TV, home to some of Russia’s high-profile talkshows featuring strident pro-war commentators. A total of eight individuals are facing personal sanctions, meaning a travel ban and freeze on any assets held in the EU, including Russian officials said to be involved in the illegal transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children in Russia, as well as the leaders of rightwing nationalist groups. In a largely symbolic move, six entities will see any EU assets frozen, including nationalist groups such as the Russian Imperial Legion, the Russian Imperial Movement and Taskforce Rusich. Unlike previous rounds of sanctions, the cost for EU countries is relatively small. Some ideas, such as a ban on the once lucrative trade in Russian diamonds, are conspicuous by their absence. The measures now have to be agreed by all 27 member states before coming into force. Speaking at the White House, Joe Biden formally announced the release of Brittney Griner from detention in Russia and pledged to continue working to bring home another American jailed in the country. “Moments ago, standing together with her wife, Cherelle, in the Oval Office, I spoke with Brittney Griner,” Biden said. She’s safe, she’s on a plane, she’s on her way home after months of being unjustly detained in Russia, held under intolerable circumstances. Brittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones, and she should have been there all along. He thanked officials in his administration who had worked for her release, as well as the United Arab Emirates, “because that’s where she landed”. The president said “the past few months have been hell” for Griner, her family and her teammates. He also mentioned the case of Paul Whelan, another American, whose release from Russia he said he was working on. “We’ve not forgotten about Paul Whelan, who’s been unjustly detained in Russia for years.” For live developments on the release of Griner, do follow our US politics live blog with my colleague Chris Stein: Around 10,000 Ukrainian service personnel and roughly the same number of Ukrainian civilians are believed to be being held in Russian detention facilities, according to Oleksandr Kononenko, who oversees human rights in the security and defence sector on behalf of Ukraine’s parliament. Konenenko said the civilians were being detained illegally as prisoners of war because of their alleged association with the Ukrainian army or state. Kononenko said: These are the total number of confirmed people who are classed as ‘missing under special circumstances’, we do not have the exact figures. Russia has not given the International Committee for the Red Cross access [to the information]. Though the ICRC has not been given full access, it has been able to visit some Ukrainian prisoners. On Thursday, the ICRC made a rare announcement that it had visited one Russian facility and that it planned to visit another this week. “ICRC teams are reaching out to families of prisoners of war to share updates from their loved ones. Most updates are short notes of love and personal news,” read the ICRC statement. In July, Oleh Kotenko, who is in charge of wartime missing people within the Ukrainian ministry for the occupied territories, put the total number of Ukrainian service personnel believed to be held by Russia at significantly less – 7,200. Kotenko said that although Ukraine had not heard from some of those reported missing, they were believed to be alive and in captivity. After Ukraine pushed Russian forces out of parts of Kharkiv and Kherson region, it has announced several prisoner swaps. The regularity of the swaps probably indicate that Ukraine detained Russian prisoners during their offensives. The former US marine Paul Whelan is still in Russian custody, his lawyer said, after news that Brittney Griner was released in a prisoner swap with the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. Dialogue on a possible prisoner swap for Whelan is ongoing, his lawyer said. Whelan was convicted by a Russian court in 2020 on espionage charges and sentenced to 16 years in a Russian high-security prison. He denied the charges. Joe Biden has tweeted that he has spoken to Brittney Griner, following the announcement that she has been released from Russian detention. In a tweet, he posted pictures of him meeting with Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, at the White House. The US basketball star Brittney Griner has been released from Russian detention in a prisoner swap for the convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout, US officials have confirmed. Griner was sentenced to nine years behind bars in Russia after being convicted on drug charges. A two-time Olympic gold medallist and champion, she was arrested on 17 February, a week before Russia sent troops into Ukraine, at a Moscow airport while in possession of vape cartridges containing cannabis oil, which is banned in Russia. Bout, known as “the merchant of death”, was one of the world’s most wanted men before his 2008 arrest on multiple charges related to arms trafficking. For almost two decades, he was one of the world’s most notorious arms dealers, selling weaponry to rogue states, rebel groups and murderous warlords in Africa, Asia and South America. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. The Kremlin has said the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Russia annexed in 2014, was vulnerable to attacks by Ukrainian forces after officials there said they had shot down a drone near a key naval base. The Moscow-installed governor of Sevastopol, the largest city in annexed Crimea, said this morning that Russia’s fleet shot down a Ukrainian drone over the Black Sea. Speaking to reporters during his regular briefing, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: There are certainly risks because the Ukrainian side continues its policy of organising terrorist attacks. But, on the other hand, information we get indicates that effective countermeasures are being taken. His comments came after President Vladimir Putin recently made a visit to the Kerch bridge, the key link between annexed Crimea and mainland Russia which was partially destroyed by an explosion in October. The Russian-installed head of occupied Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said last month that he had ordered “fortification works to ensure the safety of Crimeans” to be built on the peninsula after recent attacks. Speaking during his briefing with reporters today, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia is still set on seizing parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that President Vladimir Putin claimed as his own. The Russian leader announced he had annexed four Ukrainian regions – Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk – after holding fake referendums in order to claim a mandate for his territorial claims. However Moscow does not have full control of any of the four provinces of Ukraine it says it annexed, and Peskov appeared to set a limit on the Ukrainian territory that Russia now sought to claim. Asked whether Russia planned to incorporate any more territories beyond the four regions, he replied: There is no question of that. At least, there have been no statements in this regard. But there is nevertheless a lot of work ahead to liberate the territories; in a number of new regions of the Russian Federation there are occupied territories that have to be liberated. I mean part of the Donetsk Republic, as well as what became part of the Russian Federation, and then was re-occupied by Ukrainian troops. My colleague Peter Beaumont is in Donbas, eastern Ukraine, amid worsening wintry conditions. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has called on Russia to answer for “atrocities” committed by its forces in Ukraine. Thomas-Greenfield was responding to a report by the UN’s human rights office, published yesterday, that found that at least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights documented summary executions and attacks in dozens of towns across three regions, and warned the actual number of victims in the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions was likely to be much higher. The report covered the beginning of Moscow’s invasion on 24 February until early April, and gathered evidence from 102 towns and villages in Ukraine. It said: The acts in question were committed by Russian armed forces in control of these areas and led to the deaths of 441 civilians (341 men, 72 women, 20 boys and 8 girls). Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report said. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in what it calls a “special military operation”. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said the US’s withdrawal from a treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles was a “destructive” act that created a vacuum and stoked additional security risks. The 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty had kept nuclear missiles off European soil for more than three decades, but the treaty expired in 2019 after the US and Russia failed to agree on how to keep it alive. Speaking on the 35th anniversary of the signing of the treaty by the US president, Ronald Reagan, and Soviet general secretary, Mikhail Gorbachev, Zakharova said: The INF treaty had an indefinite life and was able to provide predictable restraint in the missile sphere for many years to come. Russia has claimed that its proposed safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was to “stop Ukrainian shelling”. A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, made the comments this morning, according to Reuters. Both sides have accused each other of shelling the plant, which is Europe’s biggest nuclear power station. There are fears the attacks could cause a nuclear accident. Russia seized it shortly after its invasion in February. The International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog has called for a demilitarised safety zone around the plant. The Red Cross has visited Ukrainian and Russian prisoners of war in the past week, and it hopes that inspections can become more frequent. Since the Russian invasion the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has seen hundreds of prisoners on both sides of the conflict. However its president, Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, said access had been “sporadic”. “My expectation is that these visits lead to more regular access to all prisoners of war,” the statement cited Spoljaric Egger as saying, according to Reuters. “While the recent visits are important progress, the ICRC must be granted unimpeded access to see all prisoners of war repeatedly and in private, wherever they are held.” The ICRC carried out a two-day visit to Ukrainian PoWs this week, according to Reuters. It also visited Russian PoWs last week. The UN human rights office said in November that its monitors had not been allowed access to Ukrainian prisoners held by Russia. Ukraine has introduced new emergency power cuts as it tried to repair energy infrastructure damaged in Russian airstrikes, which the national grid operator said had caused significant supply shortages. Russia targeted power facilities across Ukraine in the latest big wave of attacks on Monday, at a time of the year when energy consumption usually rises as temperatures plunge. “As of 11:00 on 8 December, because of damage caused by missile strikes to power plants and the high-voltage network, the system has a significant shortage of electricity,” the grid operator Ukrenergo said. It said the situation was complicated by the weather, with western regions facing frost, rain, snow and strong winds that were causing wires to ice over, Reuters reports, but the most difficult situation was in eastern areas, where fighting has been fiercest. “In all regions, there is a lack of energy – up to a third of what is needed,” said Oleksandr Starukh, the governor of the Zaporizhzhia region in south-eastern Ukraine. Monday’s attacks began as emergency blackouts were due to end, with previous damage repaired. DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private power producer, said there were now emergency power cuts in the capital Kyiv and the Kyiv region, in the southern region of Odesa and in Dnipro, central Ukraine. Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February, has increased attacks on energy facilities in recent weeks, saying strikes on vital infrastructure are militarily legitimate. Ukraine says attacks intended to cause civilian misery are a war crime. The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has produced a paper after Vladimir Putin’s meeting with the Russian presidential council on Wednesday where he said the war in Ukraine could be a “lengthy process”. Putin struck an imperialist tone. He compared himself to Peter the Great by noting that Russia controls the Sea of Azov, which the Russian tsar also fought for. The ISW said Putin seemed unwilling to go for a temporary break in fighting to regroup, as the Nato secretary general had suggested the Kremlin may look to do. “The Russian military is continuing offensive operations around Bakhmut and is – so far -denying itself the operational pause that would be consistent with best military practice. “Putin’s current fixation with continuing offensive operations around Bakhmut and elsewhere is contributing to Ukraine’s ability to maintain the military initiative in other parts of the theater. Ukraine’s continued operational successes depend on Ukrainian forces’ ability to continue successive operations through the winter of 2022-2023 without interruption,” the paper said. The report’s authors added that there appeared to be friction in the Belarusian military over Russian attempts to pressure them into joining the war. “[The] ISW continues to assess that Belarus is highly unlikely to enter the war in Ukraine due to domestic factors that constrain Lukashenko’s willingness to do so.” Our world affairs editor, Julian Borger, is in Zaporizhzhia, from where he has filed this dispatch as fighting intensifies in southern Kherson. The people of Nova Kakhovka on the east bank of the Dnipro River had grown accustomed to constant shelling, but in recent days they have been hearing machine gun fire as the war draws closer to what could be its next major battlefield. Despite predictions that the conflict would slow down in the winter months, civilians arriving in Zaporizhzhia through the last open crossing point on the frontlines say the fighting is escalating in southern Kherson region as Ukrainian forces seek to keep the Russians on the retreat towards Crimea and beyond. “It has been machine guns lately, not artillery,” said Anna, a 78-year-old from Nova Khakovka after arriving at a police checkpoint in Zaporizhzhia. “The windows were shaking, the house was shaking. We were afraid that everything could collapse at any moment.” Read more: Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said Moscow would keep to its moratorium on deploying intermediate-range nuclear forces in Europe, as long as the US did not deploy such weapons in Europe or Asia. “The moratorium is still in place, but if such weapons are deployed by the United States on European or Asian territory, our approach cannot remain unchanged,” Ryabkov told the Rossiya 24 news channel according to Reuters. He made similar comments a year ago. The UK Ministry of Defence has published its daily update on the situation in Ukraine according to its intelligence sources. It said Russia had an “almost continuous trench system” for a 60km (37 miles) stretch between Svatove in Luhansk oblast and the Russian border. The MoD added, however, that the depth of the defence remained “unclear”. Svatove is a small city to the north of Luhansk city. The region has been occupied since Russia’s initial invasion in 2014. The MoD said Russia’s 1st Guards Tank Army is partially deployed near Svatove but the “supposedly elite” group took heavy casualties earlier in the war, including in the retreat from Kharkiv in September 2022. “It has now been partially reinforced with mobilised reservists, although remaining well below its authorised strength of over 25,000 personnel,” the update added. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Europe lacked “critical defence capabilities” at the annual conference of the European Defence Agency on Thursday. Addressing attendees he said it made Europe vulnerable to “higher-level threats”. His comment echoes a recent remark by the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, who said “Europe isn’t strong enough” without the US. Here is the clip: As Christmas approaches, Ukrainian authorities are taking extra steps to try to create a festive feeling despite the conflict. In Kharkiv, which was occupied by Russian troops earlier this year, a tree has been erected in a subway to protect it from artillery or missiles. Russian forces are trying to use locals in Zaporizhzhia to fight for their army to replace Russian personnel who have been killed. The general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said in the Russian-occupied region, the authorities have issued summonses to men of conscription age in Melitopol. “The Russian occupiers plan to mobilise local residents in order to replenish current losses,” the update said. The Ukrainian army has killed another 340 Russian troops in the last 24 hours. More than 93,000 Russian personnel have been killed since 24 February, a post on Facebook by the general staff of the armed forces said. Battles on 8 December also led to the loss of two Russian battle tanks, two armoured combat vehicles and two artillery systems. A further two drones, which have been used to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure and residential areas, were shot down. These are figures provided by the Ukrainian side, which have not been verified by the Guardian. Russia’s published statistics show much lower numbers of losses. • The original key event headline on this blog entry has been corrected to make clear it was 93,000 Russian troops Ukraine is claiming have been killed. A Ukrainian pilot who shot down two missiles and five drones before ejecting from his plane has been awarded the Hero of Ukraine, the order of the Gold Star. Maj Vadym Voroshylov carried out the operation over the Vinnytsia oblast on 12 October, before ejecting from his jet after it had been damaged. A photo of him has been circulated on the internet in Ukraine this week, as he took a photo of himself bloodied but defiant afterwards, giving a thumbs-up to the camera. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy approved a government decree on Monday giving him the honour, in recognition of his service. Before I hand you over to my colleague, Harry Taylor, here are some of the latest snaps to come out of Ukraine today. The number of oil tankers waiting in the Black Sea to cross Istanbul’s Bosphorus strait on the way to the Mediterranean rose by five to 16 on Thursday, a shipping agency said, according to a Reuters report. Talks are continuing between western and Turkish officials on steps to resolve the tanker queues after new restrictions were rolled out aimed at Russian oil exports. The G7 group of countries, the European Union and Australia agreed to bar shipping service providers like insurers from helping export Russian oil unless it is sold at an enforced low price, or cap, to deprive Moscow of wartime revenue. But a separate Turkish measure in force since the start of the month has caused a logjam, requiring vessels to provide proof they have insurance covering the duration of their transit through the Bosphorus strait or when calling at Turkish ports. The Tribeca shipping agency named five new tankers longer than 200m waiting north of the Bosphorus strait to cross southbound towards the Mediterranean Sea, in addition to the 11 named a day earlier. It said no ships were scheduled to cross. At the Dardanelles strait further south, nine tankers were waiting to cross southbound, down from 12 a day earlier, the agency said. Three tankers were scheduled to pass through that strait on Thursday, two en route from Tuapse in Russia to Fujairah in the UAE and one en route from Tuzla in Turkey to Sidi Kerir in Egypt. Russian troops are reportedly taking part in tactical exercises in Belarus, according to the Russian defence ministry. Belarus has said it will not enter the war in Ukraine, but President Alexander Lukashenko has in the past ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near the Ukrainian border, citing threats from Kyiv and the west. In a statement cited by Reuters, Russia’s defence ministry said: Servicemen of the Western Military District ... continue intensive combat training on the ranges of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus … Combat training events are held during both daylight and at night. Servicemen are shooting from all types of small arms, as well as from mortars; they hone their skills in driving combat vehicles, pass psychological obstacle courses, study tactical medicine and other disciplines.” Video clips posted by the ministry showed Russian soldiers in snow gear training near tanks in a winter landscape, firing weapons including artillery. Ukraine used domestically-modified Soviet drones to strike Russian bases hundreds of miles from its border, according to a recent Politico report. The drones reportedly struck two military airbases in Russia killing three Russian service members and damaging two airplanes earlier this week. The drones used in the attack, according to two people familiar with the operation who spoke with Politico on the condition of anonymity, were modified Tu-141 surveillance aircraft left over from the Soviet era. “The key success factor was a surprise. Russia just did not expect anything of this sort,” said one of the individuals, who works with the Ukrainian government. “Now they will be prepared.” Ukraine has for months requested long-range missiles and drones from its western allies, but have so far been refused. Russian forces have fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid, which is still working despite taking major damage, Interfax Ukraine news agency cited a senior official as saying on Wednesday. Volodymyr Kudrytsky, chief executive of the Ukrenergo grid operator, also told a meeting arranged by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) that his officials were scouring the world for the complex equipment needed for repairs. Eight recent waves of Russian air strikes on critical infrastructure have seriously damaged the grid and led to emergency and planned outages across the country. Interfax Ukraine cited Kudrytsky as saying: These attacks represent the biggest blow to a power grid that humanity has ever seen. More than 1,000 shells and rockets were fired at electrical facilities and lines, including substations.” Ukraine now has a serious shortage of generating capacity, even though consumption is down between 25% and 30% compared to the pre-war period. The system is still working, it is integrated, not broken or disconnected,” Kudrytsky said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy later said Ukraine was increasing the electricity supply every day but noted problems in Kyiv and several other regions. “We should not forget ... that it is impossible to restore 100% of the energy system, as it was before the beginning of the Russian energy terror,” he said in an evening video address. “Time is needed. That is why scheduled blackouts continue in most of the cities and districts,” he continued. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy provided a battleground update in his latest national address on Wednesday evening. Regarding the Donetsk region, Bakhmut districts and other hottest spots. A very fierce confrontation is ongoing there, every metre counts.” Zelenskiy also noted Russian forces made a “brutal, absolutely deliberate strike” on Kurakhove, also in the Donetsk region. The strike reportedly killed ten people. Today [Wednesday] the Russian army carried out a very brutal, absolutely deliberate strike at Kurakhove. Precisely at civilians. At ordinary people. At the market, elevator, gas station, bus station, residential building. The list of the dead so far includes ten people, there are many wounded.” The US has denounced “loose talk” on nuclear weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin mused on rising risks of nuclear war but said Moscow would not strike first. Putin hinted that “such a threat is rising” during a Kremlin meeting on Wednesday but assured that “Russia will under no circumstances use them first”. US State Department spokesman Ned Price, asked about Putin’s remarks, declined to reply directly but said: We think any loose talk of nuclear weapons is absolutely irresponsible.” Price said that nuclear powers around the world since the Cold War, including China, India, the United States and Russia itself, have been clear that “a nuclear war is something that must never be fought and can never be won.” We think any other rhetoric – whether it is nuclear saber-rattling or even raising the spectre of the use of tactical nuclear weapons – is something that is irresponsible,” Price said. It is dangerous, and it goes against the spirit of that statement that has been at the core of the nuclear non-proliferation regime since the Cold War.” US officials have voiced fear that Russia could use nuclear weapons if it feels routed on the battlefield and could plant a fictitious story to justify its actions. Putin dedicated some of his remarks on Wednesday to questions about the potential for nuclear war, which he said was growing more likely due to the conflict with the west. This threat is increasing, I can’t deny it,” Putin said in response to a question, adding that Russia would not use those weapons first. We have not gone crazy, we are aware of what nuclear weapons are. We have these means, and they are more advanced and more modern than those of any other nuclear country. As of today, this is an obvious fact. We are not going to wave these weapons around like a razor, running around the world, but of course we act with the understanding that they exist.” Vladimir Putin has admitted Russia’s war in Ukraine could turn into a “long-term process” as he sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack. Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin claimed that Russia would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict, denied that Russian troops were deserting en masse from the field of battle, and claimed he would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia. As for the slow process of the special military operation, then, of course, it can be a long-term process,” Putin said. But then you mentioned that new territories had appeared. This is such a significant result for Russia … The Azov Sea has become an internal Russian sea. Even Peter I had fought for access to the Azov Sea.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reported “very fierce” fighting in the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut where Russian troops continue to strike the eastern Donetsk region. The US on Wednesday denounced “loose talk” on nuclear weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin mused on rising risks of nuclear war but said Moscow would not strike first. For any updates or feedback you wish to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: Russian shelling killed 10 people and wounded many others in the town of Kurakhove in eastern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko warned of an “apocalypse” scenario for the city this winter if Russian airstrikes on infrastructure continue. Russia has fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid, Interfax Ukraine news agency said. President Vladimir Putin has said that Russia’s war in Ukraine could turn into a “long-term process”. Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack. Putin also claimed that Russia would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict and denied that Russian troops were deserting en-mass from the field of battle. He claimed that the Russian military would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia. The risk of nuclear weapons being used in the Ukraine conflict has lessened thanks to international pressure on Russia, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an interview published Thursday. “One thing has changed for the time being: Russia has stopped threatening to use nuclear weapons. In response to the international community marking a red line,” Scholz said in the interview with Germany’s Funke media group. Talks between Russia and the United States on securing an exchange of high-profile prisoners are making only sporadic progress, a top Russian diplomat said in comments published on Thursday. The two countries have been examining ways of conducting an exchange to enable jailed Americans Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan to go free. Moscow has made it known it would like convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout to be included in any deal. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Russia is attempting to “freeze” the fighting in Ukraine over the winter to prepare its forces for a renewed assault early next year. Stoltenberg urged Nato allies to continue sending weapons to Kyiv over the winter, adding that the conditions for a peaceful settlement to the war are “not there now”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said 31 “suspicious packages” had been sent to Ukrainian missions in 15 countries. In the past week, Ukraine says its embassies and consultants across Europe have received “bloody” packages, some containing animal eyes, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. A road accident in the temporarily occupied eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk has left 16 people dead and several injured, according to a Russian-backed official and state media. The accident involved a minibus and a truck, whose passengers included soldiers, and took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, emergency services told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has called on the country’s western allies to boycott Russian culture. Writing in the Guardian, Tkachenko argues that a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”. The European Commission has proposed a ninth package of sanctions on Russia, including adding almost 200 additional individuals and entities on the sanctions list. In a statement, the head of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, accused Russia of “deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure” and of continuing to “bring deaths and devastation to Ukraine”. The US has made clear to Ukraine its “concerns” about any escalation of the war with Russia, the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said. Kirby said the principle behind the war in Ukraine was one of sovereignty, and “unlike the Russians, we respect Ukrainian sovereignty”. Kirby’s comments came after Kyiv appeared to launch a pre-emptive strike on bombers on two Russian airbases far from the frontlines earlier this week. The Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was “provocation towards our country”. The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over President Joe Biden’s request earlier this year. Britain has ordered “several thousand” NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played “a decisive role” in pushing back the Russian invasion, but Labour has complained that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make. BP should donate its “wartime profits” in Russia to the reconstruction of Ukraine or ministers should impose a special windfall tax on the oil company to force it to do so, British MPs have told parliament. The British oil supermajor has a 19.75% stake in Rosneft, one of the Kremlin’s most important oil assets and signalled its intent to exit Russia nine months ago, after Russia invaded Ukraine. At least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office. Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report by the Office of the high commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said. An Orthodox priest accused of leaking information on Ukrainian defence positions to Russia has been sentenced to 12 years in prison, according to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office. The priest from Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, had been informing the Russians about the positions of Ukrainian troops since April, it said in a statement on Telegram."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jan/19/rip-levelling-up-boris-johnson-catchphrase-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T18:13:32Z","webTitle":"RIP ‘levelling up’ – another Johnson catchphrase that failed to deliver | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/19/rip-levelling-up-boris-johnson-catchphrase-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/19/rip-levelling-up-boris-johnson-catchphrase-policy","fields":{"headline":"RIP ‘levelling up’ – another Johnson catchphrase that failed to deliver","bodyText":"Levelling up is cancelled. It is so yesterday, past its sell-by date, rather Boris Johnson, defunct. Tory MPs have been given orders to drop it as a mere soundbite since “nobody knows what it means”. Instead they should use “community enhancing” and something called “gauging up”. There is no limit to the linguistic banality of modern British government. The proof is in this week’s presumably final bonanza of levelling up gifts from Rishi Sunak, announced in Blackpool. Out of his sack pops a new seafront for Cleethorpes, a high street for Catterick, an “obesity project” for Farnborough, an “AI campus” for Blackpool (no kidding), a Brexit relief road for Dover, a health centre for Camden, “step-free access” for Colindale tube station, buses for Teesside, a ferry for Shetland – on its goes, like a Lego catalogue. In any other country these would be routine spending projects decided quietly by local politicians and officials. They would be funded by local taxes and borrowing, or met within a central block grant. Only in Britain do such petty projects have to be taken to London and their proponents queue up, cap in hand, waiting on the generosity and whim of some gracious ruler. The operation is not so much Santa Claus as Louis XIV. The total sum allocated from this year’s so-called “shared prosperity” bounty is £2.1bn, supposedly to “rebalance” the British economy in the north and south. In reality, it does no such thing, since, we are told, grants must be bid for and judged “on their merits”. Only one bid in five is successful, even though a principal purpose of the programme is supposedly to atone for the cut of more than 20% in local government spending during a decade of austerity. The true gulf between local and national investment in infrastructure in Britain is obscene. Levelling up’s £2.1bn for 2023 compares with about £5bn a year spent by the Treasury on just one Johnson vanity project, the £100bn HS2 railway. How can Sunak possibly tell nurses and teachers he is short of money? HS2’s sole merit is to offer more capacity for home counties commuters into London’s Euston station. Yet the desperately needed east-west railway between Leeds and Manchester has been cancelled. Meanwhile Manchester can eat its heart out while London celebrates the opening of Europe’s most splendid new underground, the £19bn Elizabeth line. As if to ram home his exasperation with levelling up, Sunak has cancelled its cruellest gesture, the summary death sentence passed in November on the English National Opera. To prove levelling up meant business, this had been sacrificed by the Arts Council for not being as posh as the Royal Opera. It was fobbed off with a suggestion that it move to Manchester, like a disgraced priest exiled to a heathen outpost of empire. Now the ENO may yet stay in London. All that said, levelling up should not be dismissed out of hand. Johnson may have been chiefly concerned to favour his former Labour, “red wall” seats in the north. But there is no argument that Britain’s north-south divide is appalling, one of the widest gulfs between rich and poor areas of any of the world’s developed economies. It is ironic that areas that were most pro-Brexit are its chief victims. As so often with Johnson, catchphrases could not convert into policy. Ten years of austerity have left all councils in Britain struggling to meet their statutory obligations to policing, social work and community care. There is virtually no money for discretionary local projects. This has led to the growth of the present ad hoc handouts, pioneered more than 30 years ago by Lord Heseltine, when he was environment secretary under John Major. They were awarded on a competitive basis, with London and the south-east tending to win by virtue of their expanding populations and more enterprising councils. The result is the present parody of Christmas. The big money pours into favoured ministerial projects – motorways, airports, nuclear power stations, universities and hospitals – but local ones depend on Whitehall charity. There would be dribs and drabs for a bus service, a startup business, some brownfield housing or a civic museum. Any marginal seat MP had only to ask. Freeports were invented by Thatcher but discontinued in 2012 as pointless. Now they are strangely being revived. The geographical imbalance in Britain’s economy may well lie at the root of the much-debated decline in its prosperity. It will not be corrected by headline-grabbing ministerial gestures. As was indicated by levelling up’s forerunner, Cameron/Osborne’s “northern powerhouse”, rebalancing will require massive attention to reducing the magnetic appeal of London and the south-east, notably to creative young people. What is clear is that this must start with leadership, with decisions and resources devolved to local electors and their councils, as happens in the booming cities of Germany, France and Scandinavia. It is laughable that a London official should decide if Cleethorpes needs a new seafront or Shetland a new ferry. Access to central and local tax revenues and discretion over their use must be restored to elected councils. Keir Starmer has got the point. He has pledged to “take back control” for local democracy. But every party leader says that in opposition. None has ever done it. What exactly does Starmer mean by control? Or will he too degenerate into government by handout?

If we all trained our minds properly, he thought, we could live together in harmony. At best, he imagined his book might even stop wars. Today, he is in Kyiv, wearing military uniform and silhouetted against a neutral background. It is safer not to give details of where; he simply says he is in a military building. As his book is published, 13 years after it was conceived, Lieutenant Beliavsky is marking a year spent fighting for the future of Ukraine. He is a handsome, youthful 33-year-old. In other circumstances you could imagine him in a boyband or becoming the Brian Cox of psychology. But look closely, and there are heavy bags beneath his eyes. His skin is pallid. He talks slowly, measuring his words with scrupulous care. At times, he seems on the verge of tears. You look exhausted, I say. He smiles. “I’ve been in the army for a year, and we don’t have breaks or weekends. We just serve.” But he’s one of the lucky ones, he says. “I’m not on the frontline at the moment. I’m not deprived of sleep as I was in March and April last year.” Back then, he was defending a besieged Kyiv. “It was madness. We slept for only three hours a night.” He is now working in the cybersecurity team. What is life like? “Tough. But we are coping. It’s really hard here. I never thought a war of such intensity would take place again in Europe. It’s not a pleasant experience.” Beliavsky, I realise, is a master of understatement. Until he joined the army, he had always considered himself a pacifist. “I was more horrified at the thought of taking lives than being killed. Life is a gift, and we need to protect it. I always felt my mission was to help people develop this life, to grow, so we could be healthier, more productive, happier.” Not surprisingly, the start of the war caused an existential crisis. He wavered a few weeks before signing up. To go to war was a betrayal of his values. But not to go to war would have been a still bigger betrayal. “There was no other option. The smartest people in the world tried to negotiate with Russia and failed. I came to believe that in some cases you just need to stand up and fight back. Otherwise they would come and destroy everything. And I couldn’t let that happen. I thought if I stood aside, I’d never feel OK with myself in the future.” There is a quiet intensity to everything Beliavsky says. For all his conviction, he seems to be a man still coming to terms with a shattered belief system. Beliavsky grew up in Ukraine with a father who worked in commerce and a mother who worked in marketing. Fascinated by history, as a teenager he would sit with his father discussing the rise and fall of civilisations. Mad and bad dictators were a recurrent theme. At university in Kyiv, he studied international relations, and that’s where he came across Seneca’s writing on stoicism. “This book was written 2,000 years ago and it was speaking to me. That was the first time I understood the power of literature. There could be another guy in 100 years who reads your book and if it has value it could influence him. That’s great!” After an internship at the Ukrainian embassy in Kazakhstan, he worked for a year in international relations at the State Savings Bank of Ukraine. He hoped to become a diplomat. “I thought it was a means to reconcile people; to establish peace. Then I understood that peace comes from within.” He started to believe that conflict had to be treated at its source: by the time the stage of diplomacy is reached, it is often too late. He became more interested in psychology as a route to peace. “I thought, if we know how to reach internal harmony, we’ll know how to create harmony around ourselves. Because if I feel good about myself there is little chance I would start a war or suppress anybody.” In 2014, he began researching psychology and philosophy at Warwick University in the UK, studying for a PhD while continuing to work on his book. The more he studied, the more he realised he had work to do on himself. “I understood that I was messed up as well. I needed tools to fix myself.” In what way? “I didn’t know how to cope with negative emotions.” The Pyramid Mind is Beliavsky’s attempt to fix himself and the rest of us. He describes the book as a “mind management model” that explains how the mind is organised, how it works, and how best to nurture it. Part textbook, part self-help manual, it includes lots of practical advice. Rather than dedicating himself to one school of thought, Beliavsky is an integrative psychologist, uniting traditional medicine, psychology, alternative and complementary approaches. He is also a mixed martial arts expert. At the age of 19, he started learning aikido. “I asked our sensei why we were learning great techniques but ignoring others. Let’s diversify our skillset, I said, but those schools are very rigid.” So he started practising other martial arts away from the aikido class. “I felt as if I was cheating on my tutors and coaches! I ended up doing MMA because I favour this curiosity. You become a well-rounded fighter and it’s harder to defeat you.” Hold on, I say, I thought you were a pacifist? That’s the point, he says – MMA helped him move beyond negative thoughts and made him less likely to have real fights. “Even though I practised martial arts, I never tried to prove dominance over people. If somebody tries to hurt me, I do anything to avoid verbal or physical conflict.” It is a philosophy he took to the frontline. Beliavsky returned to Kyiv from the UK during the pandemic. As an IT expert, he developed apps to improve mental health, while working on his book. When the writing was finished, he planned to go on a long surfing trip in Asia, but by then Russia had invaded Ukraine. Last March he joined the army as a lieutenant. How would he describe a typical day on the frontline? “You sleep little. Too little. Then you go to your checkpoint with your military unit and patrol your district. You communicate with other units and try to capture saboteurs and maintain order in the streets. If there is a suspicious group of people, you need to be ready to use rifles and start fighting. It was like an apocalypse movie because the streets were deserted.” What was it like for a pacifist to use a rifle? There is a long pause. “Well, luckily I didn’t have to use it very often, but still … I was asked this question almost a year ago by a friend who is an American sniper. I said I hoped I would wound a person but not kill them, so that we could interrogate them. So you’re determined to do your job, but to say you’re absolutely determined to take someone’s life … no.” He trails off. What did his sniper friend say? “He said he remembered almost everyone he killed. When I asked how he coped, he said he didn’t perceive those people as human beings and it helped him. It was a hard thing for me to accept.” Could he ever adopt that mentality? “No,” he says quietly. Did he manage to shoot people without killing them? “I hope I didn’t kill anybody.” He says he can’t be sure. “Things happened so fast that you just don’t see everything.” Has his psychology proved useful in a war setting? “Yes, it’s absolutely practical,” he says. Beliavsky spends his spare time supporting his comrades. “I tell people that I know psychotherapy and psychology, I’m here if you want to talk and I have a programme for you. I have little success with the older generation, but young soldiers come for advice.” Beliavsky says his sniper friend knew more about psychology than most. “He suffered from PTSD from the war in Afghanistan and he uses mindfulness techniques to stop flashbacks. He understood the nightmare of having trauma because of war and asked me what he could do to feel better.” Are many people in Ukraine traumatised? “Yep. Many.” Beliavsky stresses he’s not just talking about the military. Is he traumatised? “I hope not,” he eventually answers. “I sleep relatively well. I had a couple of nightmares during the first month. When a shopping mall in Kyiv was destroyed by a ballistic missile, we were nearby. It was a very frightening experience.” Has he lost friends? “Yes. I lost friends on the battlefield. Not many, but some of them I knew well. I lost three friends who I knew before the war. We talked together, went to pubs, and worked together for the same IT company. We enlisted at the same time. Luckily, I haven’t lost relatives.” Beliavsky says his psychology has helped him and others cope with fear. “Soldiers have a stereotype that if I feel fear, I’m weak. And I say, well, that’s bullshit. We all have emotions, including negative emotions, for a reason. We react fast when we face a life-threatening situation. We run faster, we become stronger, we feel fear but that’s OK. It helps us to fight the situation or to flee. Fear only becomes a problem when it paralyses you.” When was he most frightened? “On 4 March, the day I joined the army. I woke up at 4am and heard that there were battles at the nuclear power station in the south of Ukraine. Fire broke out and Russians were shelling the nuclear power plant. It was the most horrifying thing I’ve felt in my life, because if there was an explosion, it wasn’t just about Ukraine – the whole continent would be impacted. It’s the largest nuclear facility in Europe. If there was an explosion, there would be no life. There would be no place for peace, for raising children, for becoming better versions of ourselves.” He seems to be reliving the horror in front of me, and is momentarily overcome by hopelessness. “At times, I just don’t see a solution.” Then he snaps out of it. “I feel lucky I can help people with the skills I have, that I can teach them psychology and instil belief.” Beliavsky knows he can’t afford to despair. He spends a lot of time teaching fellow soldiers how to rewrite the stories they tell themselves. Understandably, many can only see negative endings. “One of our most negative stories is that we’re trapped, we’re losing our lives, so it’s a nasty time to live. I’m helping them to make tweaks to these stories so they can reshape the plot.” In The Pyramid Mind, Beliavsky says that the most contented people are realists rather than optimists or pessimists. So how does he tweak narratives to make them positive but realistic? “A friend of mine said he was afraid there would be no future in our country, even after the war ended. I said: ‘What is one good or constructive thing that has come out of the war?’ And he thought, and said: ‘Well, we have become stronger as a nation, we have a powerful army, and we have people we are proud of.’ I asked him: ‘Do you think if we manage to get through this nightmare period, this hell, these people would help you and our country to rebuild faster and would there be a brighter future for everybody?’ And he said: ‘Yes.’ So he created a new narrative.” As for Beliavsky’s future, he’s telling himself as many positive stories as possible. He hopes to find a partner, have children, work on a second book, create apps to help people with their mental health. Even now, he is working on apps to support people through the war. What has the war taught him about the mentality of Ukrainians? “I knew we were resilient, but I didn’t know how wonderful and strong our people are. You’ve got 40 million united Ukrainians, so what will Putin do? Will he massacre 40 million people? That’s the only way he can win this war. The only way.” One of his biggest concerns is that war robs his people of their humanity. “I see people changing because of the war. I see them becoming tougher, and I feel heartbroken because Ukrainians are extremely outgoing, friendly people. We need to protect our souls and minds.” Are Ukrainians becoming less kind? “It’s not that you become less kind, you just smile less often, joke less often. You see death every day and, as Nietzsche said, if you look at the darkness too long, the darkness also starts looking at you.” Does he think about the possibility of being killed? He nods. “I don’t find it very scary, to tell the truth. I mentioned stoicism, and one of the values I remind myself of almost every day is memento mori – we all die. The most important thing for me is the quality, not the length of life.” He talks to friends about the worst thing that can happen, and death is not top of the list. “You don’t want to be killed, but there are more terrifying things, like losing family and becoming disabled because of the attack. Many of my friends tell me that they hope it will be fast if it has to happen.” Actually, he says, if he were to die in the war, he would now feel he has made his mark on the world. “I wanted to create a book and it was the work of my life, and I was extremely happy that I finished it. When I joined the military, I thought: if I get killed, there is at least something that will keep living.” Has the war made him a better psychologist? Another pause. “I don’t know. Right now I am helping many more people than before the war. So I have much more practical experience.” Would he prefer to be a less good psychologist in a time of peace? “Yes,” he says, with a heartbreaking smile. • The Pyramid Mind by Vlad Beliavsky is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (£9.99).

Alexander Rodnyansky, an adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the war-torn country needed to speed up efforts to reform industries as it looked to rebuild after Russia’s invasion. Rodnyansky told the Guardian that the Ukrainian government needed to “create the foundations for rapid economic growth” while also financing the conflict. Ukraine faces a debt crisis as well as inflation of more than 20% as the country counts the cost of Russia’s offensive. Rodnyansky, who is also a professor of economics at the University of Cambridge, said “receiving more foreign aid is the easiest way to fund the war”; however, efforts were being made to cut spending, collect taxes and issue debt to finance its efforts. He said that Zelenskiy and his top team were also examining priorities to rebuild the economy, including progressing efforts initiated before the war to rework 50-year-old labour regulations. “We have deep issues with our labour code, developed in the 1970s, that needs to be overhauled. “We’re going to try to emulate a more liberal approach, like Denmark, with a flexible labour market because we need to catch up.” Rodnyansky said there were “peculiarities with our post-Soviet system” that had fuelled red tape. “If you want to let someone off on holiday, there is four pages of bureaucracy you need to go through. “There are also more conventional things to reform: ease of hiring, ease of firing, severance pay, flexible hours and contracts and fixed-term contracts.” Labour organisations have expressed concerns over workers’ rights amid the Ukrainian government’s labour liberalisation, which has included a vote in favour of legalising zero-hours contracts earlier this year. Rodnyansky said he was also in favour of reviewing minimum wages to scrap them in some industries where it did not increase employment. “We need to make sure it’s not too high because our economy is collapsing and we need to make sure it does not push up unemployment,” he said. A group of leading economists said last month that Ukraine’s government needed to overhaul its tax and spending policies or risk an economic crisis that could “cripple its ability to sustain the war effort”. Rodnyansky called on western nations to expand the sanctions imposed on Russian companies and individuals and sell their assets to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine. “The UK has done a lot but it has not been exhaustive,” he said. The government of Ukraine, the European Commission and the World Bank have estimated that the cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine is almost $350bn (£310bn) and rising. Rodnyansky was promoted to become chief economic adviser earlier this year after two years with the government. His father is a film producer who helped Zelenskiy become a household name as an actor. Russian attacks on Ukrainian power stations, including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear site in south-eastern Ukraine, have led to safety worries about nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
