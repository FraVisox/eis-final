According to the energy mix tracker published by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), South Australia’s energy mix around 9am Thursday morning was made up of 61% gas and 11% diesel, with wind and solar providing the rest. This occurred after Aemo issued a Threat To System Security market notice on Wednesday morning flagging a lack of gas supply on the east coast and prompting the energy market to take measures to increase supply. At the same time, a cold snap across south-eastern Australia resulted in low pressure in some eastern states leading to lower wind speeds, and cloudy days which limited the amount of sunlight. By 1pm on Thursday, the amount of diesel being burned had reduced to 3% but the proportion of gas remained high at 61%. South Australia has been a global pioneer in the transition to renewable energy, breaking records at the start of this year when it sourced all its power from renewable energy in the six days leading up to 29 December. Dylan McConnell, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne’s climate and energy college, said South Australia was burning more gas than it had in the past two years. “They absolutely were burning a lot of gas yesterday, including diesel,” McConnell said. “Normally this is not unusual, but in the context of an extreme gas shortage and gas prices, that makes it noticeable. “Diesel peakers have always been there, and they occasionally come online, but they only come on in those super peaks when prices go extremely high, maybe a couple hours a year.” McConnell said the shortage on the east coast had caused the price of gas to spike to about $40 a gigajoule in recent days. This was several times higher than the typical average price of about $10 a gigajoule, or the historical price of $3 a gigajoule that existed before the development of an export market. These prices meant it was economically viable to burn diesel for power generation. “It’s an important thing to point out that even though South Australia is high on a proportional basis, there’s more gas being burned in Queensland and similar amounts in New South Wales and Victoria on a megawatt basis,” McConnell said. “This is partly because there’s been outages at coal plants. It points to the importance of weaning ourselves off oil and gas and the volatile prices they cause. “Certainly if we had more non-coal or gas resources, prices would be lower.” McConnell said better storage options and more transmission to bring in renewable energy from different regions would help South Australia. “If those things were there earlier, you’d be burning less gas,” he said. The South Australian treasurer, Stephen Mullighan, on Thursday credited heavy investment in renewable energy for putting the state in a better position to avoid huge increases in power prices hitting other states across Australia. “Renewable energy is cheaper energy,” Mullighan told the AFR. “There’s been no increase in [the cost of] wind power or solar power.” The development comes after the new South Australian Labor government formally declared a climate emergency on Wednesday, the same day the energy minister, Tom Koutsantonis, scrapped two programs designed to encourage uptake of solar panels and batteries. South Australia’s Home Battery Scheme, designed to subsidise the installation of batteries in people’s homes, and the Switch For Solar program, allowing people to trade government concessions for installation-free solar arrays, were both abandoned. Koutsantonis described the battery scheme, which received bipartisan support, as “failed” and the solar scheme as “appalling policy”. “This was a cost-saving measure to try and get people off their concessions – I’m glad we’re killing it,” he said. No replacement scheme was announced ahead of the budget. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Craig Wilkins, chief executive of Conservation Council SA, said the decision was “driven” by a desire to cut costs, and that it appeared the state government was positioning large, grid-scale projects against the broader installation of small, decentralised systems like PV solar arrays. “It feels like … unnecessarily pitching grid big works against the traditional South Australian interventions at the small end of the market,” Wilkins said. “And they are artificially making it a battle between the two. It shouldn’t be. The energy transition needs both to thrive.” During the recent state election, the South Australian Labor government pledged to build a $593m hydrogen plant at Whyalla. Wilkins said the government should compensate for the lost programs by redirecting the money into greater electric vehicle subsidies as their batteries are five times the size of those installed in homes. “If they are well integrated into the system, they could provide good stability as well as reducing transport costs,” Wilkins said. “It’s a significant win-win.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/feb/08/indian-coal-magnate-gautam-adani-becomes-asias-richest-person-after-solar-energy-drive","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-08T03:38:10Z","webTitle":"Indian coal magnate Gautam Adani becomes Asia’s richest person after solar energy drive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/08/indian-coal-magnate-gautam-adani-becomes-asias-richest-person-after-solar-energy-drive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/feb/08/indian-coal-magnate-gautam-adani-becomes-asias-richest-person-after-solar-energy-drive","fields":{"headline":"Indian coal magnate Gautam Adani becomes Asia’s richest person after solar energy drive","bodyText":"The Indian coal mining tycoon Gautam Adani has become Asia’s richest person thanks to a push into green energy that has boosted his fortune to $88.5bn. Adani has overtaken fellow countryman Mukesh Ambani to enter the top 10 of the world’s richest people, according to figures from Forbes and Bloomberg, after seeing his personal fortune rise by $12bn in the past year. Among the mega-rich whom Adani has leapfrogged to reach the world top 10 are Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who slipped down the table several places last week after losing $30bn of his personal fortune. Although Adani has become the face of big coal around the world with its pursuit of the hugely controversial Carmichael mine project in Australia, the mogul’s ascent into the top echelons of world billionaires is down to his expansion of green investments. His Adani Group controls the port of Mundra, India’s largest, in the mogul’s home state of Gujarat and he also owns 74% of Mumbai international airport. But his push into green energy has paid off handsomely in the past year with the listed company Adani Green Energy now his most valuable after its share price almost doubled in the past 12 months. The group is in the process of ploughing $70bn into green energy projects by 2030 with the aim of becoming the world’s largest renewable-energy producer. Adani found his ambitions dovetailed with those of Indian prime minister and fellow Gujarati, Narendra Modi, who leveraged India’s huge uptake in solar power to map out more ambitious goals for cutting carbon emissions at the Glasgow climate conference in November. India plans to reach a target of 500 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and that 50% of electricity capacity would come from renewables by the same point. It plans to be net-zero by 2070. Overseas investors in Adani and India’s solar revolution include the French oil company Total, which last year bought 20% of Adani Green Energy. “The Adani Group has spotted and entered all the happening sectors at the right time, which has appealed to a select band of foreign portfolio investors,” Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at Mumbai-based brokerage HDFC Securities Ltd, told Bloomberg. “The sectors are capital-intensive and the company has faced little difficulty in raising funds to expand.” Despite the greener outlook for Adani, the group is still pressing ahead with the giant Queensland mine in the face of fierce resistance from a rainbow coalition of anti-fossil fuel activists, biodiversity conservationists and Indigenous groups. The bitter battle over the mine has seen a succession of on-site protests, legal battles, and the use of a private investigator by the company to secretly photograph the family of activists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/10/chris-oshea-centrica-chief-executive-with-a-decarbonising-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-10T15:00:06Z","webTitle":"Chris O’Shea: Centrica chief executive with a decarbonising plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/10/chris-oshea-centrica-chief-executive-with-a-decarbonising-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/10/chris-oshea-centrica-chief-executive-with-a-decarbonising-plan","fields":{"headline":"Chris O’Shea: Centrica chief executive with a decarbonising plan","bodyText":"Even for an executive in the eye of the gathering storm that is the energy crisis, Chris O’Shea seems remarkably busy. The chief executive of Centrica bustles on to our videocall from offices in Easington, East Yorkshire, after battling traffic on his way from a hydrogen project in the Humber. Afterwards he’s off to the coast, to check progress on reopening the massive Rough undersea gas storage facility – a key part of ensuring the UK will be able to keep the lights on as Russia throttles gas supplies. He has also found time to watch Liz Truss announce her energy bills bailout on the TV. Her plan involves reworking power supply contracts, a measure O’Shea, along with other industry leaders, has been pushing for. Tomorrow brings an early morning trip to Brigg power station in north Lincolnshire, where the company is building a 50-megawatt battery storage plant. He’s not complaining, though. “Having to work two jobs to make ends meet, that’s a struggle,” says O’Shea, crunching on a bag of salt- and-vinegar crisps as he hurries his lunch. “It’s a massive privilege to be in the position I’m in.” *** CV Age 48 Family Married with three children. Education Accountancy degree, University of Glasgow; MBA, Duke University, North Carolina. Pay £875k last year (waived a £1.1m bonus). Last holiday Florida. Best advice he’s been given “You’ve two eyes, two ears and one mouth: try to use them in proportion.” Phrase he overuses “Do you have five minutes?” How he relaxes Spending time with friends and family; running. *** Centrica is the largest UK company supplying power into its home market, with 8 million domestic and retail customers. It owns British Gas, the former state monopoly, and is valued at more than £5bn. Its stock has risen more than 70% over the past year, thanks to surging gas prices, and half-year profits were a thumping £1.3bn. Its assets span gasfields in the North and Irish seas, solar projects and a stake in UK nuclear power. O’Shea shrugs off public anger that has seen him vilified for high pay (potentially £4.26m this year), for still working some of the time from home and for cutting jobs – he even had faeces sent to his home near Reading: “It would be very self-indulgent to feel sorry for myself. I’m in a very fortunate position.” Later, he adds: “My brother took his life when he was 25 – that is the toughest challenge I have overcome. A personal tragedy puts everything else into perspective.” O’Shea joined the British Gas owner as finance chief in 2018, moving to the top job in April 2020. Since then, he’s navigated Covid, slashed 5,000 jobs at the former state monopoly, and taken on 800,000 customers from suppliers put out of business by surging gas prices. Now, he’s in talks with government over a voluntary profits cap and is eyeing a push into more nuclear power. Centrica owns a 20% stake in Britain’s ageing nuclear facilities through a joint venture with France’s EDF. Having flirted with selling that stake, the British firm dropped that plan last year. Despite pulling out of the project to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset with EDF a decade ago, Centrica has been linked with investing in its sister site in Suffolk, Sizewell C. O’Shea confirms this interest for the first time, saying he is seriously considering investing in the project. In one of his final acts as prime minister, Boris Johnson said that Britain was “putting up to £700m” into the project, which could cost £30bn to build. The government and EDF are understood to be finalising a deal that would see each take a 50% stake in a new vehicle while external investors are sought, pushing out China’s CGN in the process. “I’m very interested in understanding the terms of the agreement between EDF and the government,” says O’Shea. “If those terms are attractive, I would very much like to be involved in Sizewell C, but I need to see the terms and have a conversation, obviously, with my colleagues on the board. But it’s fully aligned with our strategy.” He says “some of our fears have come to pass in terms of cost overruns and delays” at Hinkley Point C, but backs EDF. “I’ve been in large capital projects myself. Things go wrong. But at good companies, when they go wrong, you learn from them.” O’Shea says he is “committed to delivering decarbonisation” by the government net zero target date of 2050 or earlier. He says: “The reality is, I believe in a decarbonised UK: that requires more wind power, more solar power, more nuclear power, and decarbonised gas.” He is even tempted by a project to build a fleet of mini nuclear plants in the UK. “I am interested in understanding a bit more about the small modular reactors that Rolls-Royce is developing. So that’s something that we would potentially look at as well.” A push into costly nuclear projects would be a bold new frontier for a self-confessed “disciplined” numbers man. Born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, O’Shea studied accountancy in Glasgow, where he had moved after his parents’ business hit hard times. He has rattled through a series of finance roles with corporate big beasts including Ernst &amp; Young, Shell, BG Group and Smiths Group, and done stints in the US and Nigeria, where his uncle was once a priest. The Scotsman’s diverse wardrobe ranges from pinstripes to sloganed hoodies. Today it’s a blue shirt and a black blazer with coral-coloured chinos. A few sprigs of white run through his dark beard. He’s not too downcast after Celtic FC, whose matches he still watches with schoolmates, lost to Real Madrid. Not content just to be a spectator, he’s preparing to run the Berlin marathon this month. Despite Truss’s intervention, this winter remains uncertain for many. O’Shea urges customers to wait until they receive their bills before inundating call centres. He says Downing Street should be “applauded” for the support, adding: “This is a two-year temporary programme, and it gives us time to fix the underlying causes of the issue.” His solution is to voluntarily give the government a slice of the outsize profits Centrica has made from its nuclear stake and its North Sea gas operations, to pay for lower bills. He is in negotiations with civil servants now about how to do that. Isn’t this merely a strategy to avoid being slapped with a more punitive windfall tax? “A windfall tax by its nature is a one-off,” he says. “It doesn’t fix the structure of the market. We’re trying to solve the same issue in a way that’s sustainable.” In one of her first acts as prime minister, Truss reopened the door to fracking. O’Shea welcomes the new policy, which will allow companies to drill – if they win approval from local residents. “It’s absolutely right: you should look at it because, again, it helps with energy security.” But would he oppose fracking near his own home? “If I was publicly in support of fracking, I couldn’t find it in my conscience to object.” • This article was amended on 11 &amp; 12 September: to correct details about O’Shea’s pay and to note that he was speaking from offices in Easington, East Yorkshire, not Easington, County Durham as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/06/uk-energy-generators-face-tax-raid-on-soaring-profits","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-06T08:51:31Z","webTitle":"Power move: UK ministers eye big energy profits for tax raid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/06/uk-energy-generators-face-tax-raid-on-soaring-profits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/06/uk-energy-generators-face-tax-raid-on-soaring-profits","fields":{"headline":"Power move: UK ministers eye big energy profits for tax raid","bodyText":"Dressed in overalls with “leave it in the ground” scrawled on their backs, climate protesters shovelled coal over the side of a goods train bound for the Drax power station in 2008. It is now 14 years on from the train “hijack” and government officials are considering their own raid on the North Yorkshire power station – this time on the company’s finances. The power giant, Britain’s single-biggest source of carbon emissions – thanks to the biomass and coal it burns – has benefited handsomely from the link between electricity prices and soaring gas prices, along with a group of nuclear plants and older solar and windfarm projects. This windfall – evident in a quadrupling of profits – has thrust Drax and its fellow generators, which are propped up by historic subsidies, into the eye of a gathering storm. With households and small businesses crushed by soaring bills, the government is considering options to break the link between gas and electricity prices as well as a windfall tax on electricity generators. The plan could be one of Kwasi Kwarteng’s first acts as chancellor if, as expected, he is promoted from business secretary by the UK’s new prime minister, Liz Truss. Germany’s decision to impose a windfall tax on electricity generators may embolden ministers to follow suit. Earlier this year, as the government imposed the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) on North Sea oil and gas operators, a similar measure was mooted for electricity generators – but was dismissed as too complex. A further leaked Treasury analysis claimed gas producers and electricity generators could make £170bn in excess profits over two years. For most companies, precise figures on windfall profits are hard to come by. But for Drax it is clear that the good times roll. In July, the company said profit before tax had risen to £200m in the first half of the year, up from £52m in the same period a year earlier, bolstered by high electricity prices. It upgraded annual profit forecasts, while landing a deal with National Grid to keep its coal-fired operations open through the winter. The group’s chief executive, Will Gardiner, saw his total pay package swell more than 30% to £2.7m. In the past 12 months, its stock has risen 56% to 660p, valuing the company at £2.65bn, after peaking at 831p in April. But the threat of a windfall tax has twice punctured the share rally and it may now face pressure to rip up the contracts for its units which burn wood pellets. Thinktank Ember calculates that from 2012 until 2027, Drax will have collected more than £11bn in government subsidies. The shape of any potential raid on electricity generators’ profits could prove crucial for Drax and its peers. A simple extension to corporation tax – as applied to the oil giants – could prove most damaging to profits and, critics argue, investor sentiment in green energy. Instead, the business department is reportedly scrutinising a plan which would see older Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) voluntarily ripped up in favour of Contracts for Difference (CFDs). ROCs are an anachronism from the early days of green power generation. They were first introduced in 2002, paying renewable energy producers the wholesale market rate plus a subsidy. The scheme was closed to new entrants in 2017 and replaced with less generous CfDs, which offer electricity plants a flat rate for what they produce over 15 years. That rate is the difference between the “strike price” – an agreed price which reflects the investment in green technology – and the “reference price”, which is a reflection of the wholesale market price for electricity. If the market price is higher than the strike price, a government entity called the Low Carbon Contracts Company ensures these savings are passed on to consumers. If the market price is lower, the LCCC makes up the shortfall. LCCC data shows that with UK power prices more than tripling in the past year, windfarms have paid back more than £360m. Under the proposals, those with ROCs would be encouraged to switch to CfDs. The benefit to consumers could be lower bills, and for the company a guaranteed long-term income which could reassure investors. However, the voluntary scheme could be undermined if companies decide instead to take their chances that gas prices will remain high for years. For those on ROCs with only a few years remaining, it could prove attractive, less so for those with a decade to go. Denmark’s Ørsted held the most ROCs in 2020/21, ahead of Drax, SSE and Germany’s RWE. Although the energy market as a whole is dominated by a clutch of large players, nearly 60% of the UK onshore wind ROCs market consists of smaller developers, Bernstein analysts estimate. The ROCs register is public: it shows everything from the Achanalt power station, a small 20 megawatt hydroelectric site in the Scottish Highlands owned by SSE, to the Four Burrows windfarm, owned by renewable specialist RES, near Truro, Cornwall. However, the nature of each site’s contracts remain undisclosed. Many will be tied into long-term electricity supply deals typically agreed between power producers and electricity traders or suppliers. ROCs are also tradable. For larger companies, their power is predominately hedged ahead in the futures markets (sold in advance) – meaning some are yet to see the full benefit from this year’s surge in gas prices. RBC analyst John Musk said: “We previously saw a lot of rhetoric around extending the windfall tax to generators when the energy profits levy was originally announced. It was seen as too difficult then – and I do not see how that changes.” However, industry watchers are confident that nuclear power stations have recorded hefty gains. British Gas owner Centrica owns a 20% stake in Britain’s nuclear fleet, which is operated by EDF. Centrica reported operating profits of £1.3bn, and noted an 11% gain in volumes of nuclear power generated, in the first half of 2022. It said the price achieved for nuclear power had risen from £46.5 per megawatt hour in 2021 to £110.4/mwh. Centrica had flirted with selling off its nuclear stake, but that plan was ditched last year. EDF is also likely to have seen a fillip, however the gains may be overshadowed by the debt-laden company’s woes in France where it is being nationalised. UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) estimates that if 100% of eligible UK wind and solar power projects were to participate in the contracts’ revamp the saving would be £12.8bn and £180 off bills. UKERC estimates that if its proposals were extended to units 2 and 3 of Drax, which burn biomass and receive RO payments, the collective savings would be £14.8bn a year. If all of Britain’s nuclear power stations participated, overall savings would reach £22.4bn. Dan Monzani, managing director for the UK and Ireland at consultancy Aurora, said UKERC’s proposal could lower the price over the next two to three winters in exchange for a fixed price extending for the remainder of the stations’ technical life. “This would spread the impact of the war on Ukraine over more years,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/sep/01/music-makes-you-fall-in-love-with-people-marlon-williams-on-his-maori-disco-bop","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T17:30:27Z","webTitle":"‘Music makes you fall in love with people’: Marlon Williams on his ‘Māori disco bop’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/01/music-makes-you-fall-in-love-with-people-marlon-williams-on-his-maori-disco-bop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/sep/01/music-makes-you-fall-in-love-with-people-marlon-williams-on-his-maori-disco-bop","fields":{"headline":"‘Music makes you fall in love with people’: Marlon Williams on his ‘Māori disco bop’","bodyText":"It’s appropriate that Marlon Williams is chilling in a rocking chair when we talk. The only furniture more suited to his heady and breezy third solo album, My Boy, would be a hammock. The title track is a perfect indication: a good-times radio hit, or “Māori disco bop” as Williams puts it, set to guitar played in Māori strum style (also known as jingajik, jungajuka and dumdejak, from which you no doubt get the idea). It’s a welcome salve after a few stagnant years, in which he – like most musicians – could not tour his last release. What’s more, it feels like a huge-hearted album. “That makes me very happy,” Williams says, when I say so. “I wanted it to be concerned and loving, and keep the arms of the record open. I can’t help but write dark songs most of the time, so I set up the world around me to make sure I kept it upbeat.” To this end, My Boy is adorned with trinkets such as an arpeggiated synth, a mellotron (beloved by XTC, the Bee Gees and the Beatles) and a tropical-tinged pedal steel, as well as the sort of expressive percussion that made The White Lotus soundtrack such a delight. You’re likely to hear kaleidoscopic notes of the Byrds and the Beatles, but also the arch pop confidence of Duran Duran and nods to Paul Simon and Elvis, all lovingly woven in among those Māori elements. (Williams is of Ngāi Tahu and Ngāi Tai descent and is planning an album of Māori-language music next.) Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning All of this is a big change for the artist known for murder ballads and country crooning – and it’s not the only change, either. When Covid hit, Williams moved home to Christchurch after living in Melbourne for years, and bought a house to live in with his father, also a musician. Now he’s looking forward to kitting the place out, having returned from an international tour with Lorde, playing castles and colosseums. Lorde was promoting her album Solar Power, which Williams describes as a love album about New Zealand, and he was finding himself pulled that way too. “A lot of my record is about finding yourself back home where things are easygoing and there’s a beach within 100 miles of any spot,” he says. “It’s funny, because we both put out breakup records in 2018 and then put out sunny New Zealand records a few years later.” Group singing has been central to Williams’ life. He likens it to a spiritual practice, “without the theory or having to worry about its tangential relationship to reality”. Upon first play of My Boy there’s every chance you’ll find yourself harmonising. You can almost hear the woosh of oxytocin. “There’s nothing like it,” Williams says. “I first started singing in the choir when I was a kid and I thought, this is incredible, this is all that matters. Why is anyone doing anything else? Then I joined the cathedral choir and I got more into my Māori side, where sharing one voice is such an integral part of life. Pretty much every world I’ve delved into musically – country, bluegrass – has been based around harmony singing.” When the pandemic hit, as researchers wrote in the Conversation, “One of the most encouraging phenomena we have begun to see in response to social distancing laws are the innovative ways that people are starting to bond with each other, particularly musically.” There were viral videos of neighbours singing together on their balconies in locked-down countries such as Italy, and people meeting up on Zoom to sing in groups. More recently, Brisbane’s Pub Choir swelled to 1,600 people, gathering to sing Kate Bush’s 1985 hit Running Up That Hill. The performance resonated globally and even prompted Bush to write them an emotional message. “I think it’s exciting that we’re going back to the tribal elements of group singing because it’s clearly so vital to us,” Williams says. “Music therapy is only growing as a tool. It staves off dementia and does all these incredible things.” For Williams, playing with other musicians provides a similar shortcut to intimacy. Even if the music is maudlin, harmonising feels like the weight of sadness is shared. “Being at the top of one bar and looking at someone and being like, I wonder if we’re gonna … and then yeah! There’s some semi-telepathic magic that happens and it’s just euphoric,” he says. “It’s an unfolding world that’s greater than the sum of its parts. It makes you fall in love with people.” This time around, Williams left his usual band, the Yarra Benders, in Melbourne (though they’ll tour My Boy with him). The drawback of working with old friends is that they’ll predict what they think you want; instead, he recorded in New Zealand with a new crew. “I wanted to be the new kid at school,” Williams says. “I wanted to be able to make up complete lies to these people and then try to hold it together until they found out the truth, just for the sake of being able to reinvent myself.” There are many faces to Williams. He’s always had a penchant for making theatrical videos to accompany his singles. “I just love dreaming up stupid ideas,” he says. “Especially if they shift the context of the song and muddy the waters” and his side hustle as an actor has developed into a secondary career. Among his TV and film credits are A Star is Born, The Beautiful Lie, Sweet Tooth, True History of the Kelly Gang, Bad Behaviour and Lone Wolf. And on My Boy – on which he’s noticed an inadvertent theme of older brother mentor figures – he inhabits many characters and voices. “There are a couple of personal pleas out to the world on the record, that’s for sure, but otherwise I’m posturing across most it,” he says. “A friend of mine hit me up about [single] Thinking of Nina the other day, and said, ‘You know life’s not actually like that?’ I said, ‘Yeah, I know. That guy’s an arsehole, I’m not that guy. Please don’t align me with him.’ Sometimes I fret about whether I need to be more explicit about that stuff.” The album closes with Promises; a pathos-driven track that is very different in spirit and style to the rest. I’m curious as to why he chose to conclude in such a way. “There’s an earnestness to that song,” Williams says. “It’s an out-and-out love song, and it was my way of presenting to the audience the idea that the record was made with love and there’s ultimately no cynicism here. Everything is allowed. It was a statement to the audience to say, ‘I’m with you in the trenches.’” My Boy is out on 9 September (Dead Oceans). Marlon Williams is touring the US in September, then UK and Europe in October and November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2021/jun/28/solar-farm-proposals-for-east-of-england-more-than-double","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-28T12:46:11Z","webTitle":"Farmers swap crops for energy as east of England solar farm proposals double","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/28/solar-farm-proposals-for-east-of-england-more-than-double","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/jun/28/solar-farm-proposals-for-east-of-england-more-than-double","fields":{"headline":"Farmers swap crops for energy as east of England solar farm proposals double","bodyText":"The number of new solar farms planned for the east of England has more than doubled in recent months as farmers decide to swap crops for clean energy.

The solar boom is expected to yield more than double the solar energy capacity that came forward for the east of England in the same months last year, and would be enough to power the equivalent of 400,000 homes with clean energy. Dr Nina Skorupska, the chief executive of the Association for Renewable Energy, said it was “crucial that this momentum is maintained” to help meet the UK’s climate targets and “also help stimulate much-needed new investment in the region”. Most of these new solar farms will be built on former agricultural land as landowners begin to swap growing crops for generating clean electricity, according to UK Power Networks, which manages the local electricity grid. The east of England is particularly popular with renewable energy developers because of its flat fields and sunny weather. However, more landowners are beginning to pursue solar power in the area after UK Power Networks scrapped the upfront cost to connect to the local energy grid. Under new rules put in place at the beginning of 2020, solar farm developers can connect to the grid cheaper and faster in exchange for allowing UK Power Networks to reduce their electricity output at times of low energy demand. The scheme led to a nine-year high in the number of solar farm applications to connect to the UK Power Networks grid last year despite the Covid-19 pandemic, and could help the UK to increase its renewable energy without overpowering the system when solar power outstrips local energy demand. UK Power Networks said the number of applications to connect batteries has also spiralled compared with last year. Nine new battery applications were accepted between January and May this year, with a power rating of 385MW, up from only three projects totalling 27.5MW in the same months last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/16/michael-gove-not-convinced-by-case-for-more-fracking-in-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-16T16:45:49Z","webTitle":"Michael Gove ‘not convinced’ by case for more fracking in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/16/michael-gove-not-convinced-by-case-for-more-fracking-in-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/16/michael-gove-not-convinced-by-case-for-more-fracking-in-uk","fields":{"headline":"Michael Gove ‘not convinced’ by case for more fracking in UK","bodyText":"Michael Gove has said he is “not convinced” by the case for more fracking in the UK, opening up a cabinet split after Boris Johnson ordered a rethink and Jacob Rees-Mogg backed reversing the moratorium. Gove, the levelling up secretary, made the comments at an environment reception, where he also spoke of the need for more onshore wind power. Onshore wind is blocked in many cases by planning restraints as the rules make it easy for communities to object. But Gove’s brief now encompasses planning, raising the possibility he could use reforms of the system to make it easier for onshore wind projects to gain permission. Casting Vladimir Putin in the role of a “pusher” of oil and gas fuelling an addiction to hydrocarbons in the west, Gove told the reception: “The only way you can wean yourself off the addiction is to diversify the sources of energy we have. The only way to diversify our sources of energy is if we ensure that we continue to invest in renewables, onshore and offshore wind, solar power and also look at the potential of hydrogen in the future, if we allow nuclear to be part of the mix and recognise that hydrocarbons have a role to play but a diminishing one over time.” Ministers are exploring the case for reversing the ban on fracking after No 10 ordered a new energy strategy amid soaring prices and the global move to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas. The UK is phasing out Russian oil by the end of the year and looking to cut out gas as well. However, the Guardian revealed this week that very few MPs said they would be happy with a fracking site in their own constituency. When asked if they would support fracking in their seats, only five of the 138 MPs said they would. Forty-one said they would be against it, while the rest did not reply, or declined to comment. There is also still uncertainty over the fracking wells owned by the oil and gas production company Cuadrilla, which is planning to concrete them over within weeks. Johnson has told the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, that it does “not make sense” to seal its shale gas wells. His spokesperson also opened the door to a shift in the UK’s position last week, saying that “all options” would be considered before the forthcoming energy strategy was completed. However, no moves have yet been made to reverse a notice issued by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) that both wells must be plugged with cement by the end of June. The government has instead indicated to Cuadrilla that it is welcome to apply for an extension to keep the wells open. Before last week, the government had repeatedly insisted there was no case for fracking. Greg Hands, a business minister, also struck a negative note in the House of Commons on Tuesday, saying: “Even if the pause were lifted, there are unlikely to be sufficient quantities of gas available to address the high prices affecting all of western Europe and it would certainly have no effect on prices in the near term.” In contrast, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for Brexit opportunities, had also signalled support for a change in policy in cabinet and in public. On his Moggcast podcast, he called shale gas “very clean” and appeared to dismiss concerns about tremors caused by drilling. He said: “Some of the seismic effects are ones that can only be measured with sophisticated equipment. Others are equivalent to a bus passing by your house, assuming there’s a pavement in between you and the house. And as I say, it’s not the San Francisco earthquake.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/apr/17/were-trying-to-turn-the-magnet-towards-optimism-cate-blanchett-on-her-new-climate-crisis-podcast","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-17T12:00:28Z","webTitle":"‘We’re trying to turn the magnet towards optimism’: Cate Blanchett on her new climate crisis podcast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/17/were-trying-to-turn-the-magnet-towards-optimism-cate-blanchett-on-her-new-climate-crisis-podcast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/apr/17/were-trying-to-turn-the-magnet-towards-optimism-cate-blanchett-on-her-new-climate-crisis-podcast","fields":{"headline":"‘We’re trying to turn the magnet towards optimism’: Cate Blanchett on her new climate crisis podcast","bodyText":"Cate Blanchett is Australian. I mention this fact because I’d forgotten it, somehow, so her manner of speaking – upbeat, front-footed, Aussie-accented – comes as a surprise. And I’ve spent quite some time hearing her talk over the past couple of days, as she has a new podcast, Climate of Change, which she hosts with her friend Danny Kennedy, another Australian. Kennedy is the CEO of an environmental non-profit, New Energy Nexus, and runs the California Clean Energy Fund. Their podcast, as you may have guessed from the title, is about the climate emergency. But before you come over all world-weary and what’s-the-point, before you get tetchy about preachy celebrities telling us stuff we already know, you might as well stop. Blanchett is already there. “You can recycle up the wazoo, Miranda,” she says (told you she’s Australian), “but it can just make you feel more cross and isolated and panicky… I get that. What we’re trying to do with the podcast is to turn the magnet towards optimism in these incredibly pessimistic times.” We’re talking via video link, but Blanchett has her camera turned off. Kennedy, who’s in his office in Oakland, California, hasn’t and he wanders around, showing us the view from the window (just some more offices, really). Blanchett’s location is a secret, due to heavy-handed PRs and her natural privacy, though I’d guess she’s in the UK (she lives in Sussex). Their location doesn’t really matter, of course, as they’re talking about a worldwide problem. The climate crisis is very real – we need to halve the world’s carbon emissions by 2030 – and becoming even more so for those living in Europe, with our reliance on Russian gas. If you think about it all too hard, you can panic. And Blanchett does, she says. In the first episode, she chats into the mic as she drives her electric car towards London and discusses how overwhelmed she can feel by the “tide of bad news”. She describes herself as a “mother of four” (the oldest is 20, the youngest seven) and an “optimistic pessimist”, and confesses to range anxiety as she forgot to plug in her car to charge last night. Her role in the show is to represent the listener, really, which is weird as she’s globally famous. But Blanchett’s everyday attitude is similar to many: she wonders aloud if making an effort, when it comes to the environment, is worth it. Why bother recycling, up the wazoo or no, if the tipping point to the end of the world is so close and the people in power are still locked into fossil fuels? She and Kennedy made Climate of Change earlier this year, mostly in a studio in east London. They have some strong guests: Adam McKay, the director of Don’t Look Up, makes an appearance, as does Prince William, to talk about his Earthshot prize. (He explains it very well, actually; it sounds much more interesting than I’d realised.) Still, at the start of the series, in common with many climate emergency podcasts, the discussion can feel rather broad, with smudgy chat about tech and innovation and the “disruptive decade”. At one point, someone says: “We are the stories we tell ourselves”, which might be true but doesn’t help that much with the gas bill. By episode two, however, the show is focusing on real-life solutions and these are undoubtedly encouraging. We meet a Filipino woman who’s designed a clean energy lamp that local fisherpeople can use; the Londoner who’s brought gardening to train stations; the designer of living sea walls that encourage plants and fish to thrive. One California company, OhmConnect, has such a good idea about reducing at-home use of electricity that I try to sign up. But it’s not yet available in the UK. What they’re trying to do with the podcast, says Kennedy, is appeal to people like me. To show us tired recyclers that the answers to environmental catastrophe are already out there. “I think the choir has heard the doom and gloom song for a long time,” he says, “and sung it from the song sheet, like a good choir would. What they haven’t been taught is the song about solutions and the fact we’ve got them.” “A lot of people are feeling fatigued,” says Blanchett. “I think we need a sense of, ‘No, don’t worry, these changes are happening.’ Because they are.” Blanchett and Kennedy met in Sydney in the early 1990s. They were part of the same social circle – Kennedy wrote a play with Andrew Upton, now Blanchett’s husband. Later, in 2008, Blanchett and Upton were appointed co-artistic directors of Sydney Theatre Company and decided to try to make the building, an old timber-and-glass warehouse, as ecologically sound as possible. They enlisted Kennedy to help. He brought in consultants – “one guy called Gavin Gilchrist: Cate, if you recall, the fellow who did the toilet flushes” – and helped redo the insulation to make the building “tighter and better, even though it was a pretty old, leaky, wooden construction”. The biggest proposal was the installation of solar energy panels, which proved difficult to get past heritage rules and the general cynicism of Sydney’s county council. “We were met by a lot of internal scepticism and external opposition,” remembers Blanchett. “You know: ‘What has this to do with a cultural institution, what does it have to do with making theatre, why are we bothering?’ So we thought: ‘OK, we’ll be at the theatre company for 10 years and we have a whole suite of ambitions. And the solar panels will probably be the last one we achieve, if we do.’ And it was the first one we achieved.” It took two years. There are now 1,906 solar panels powering lights, ventilation and air con across the building. Kennedy thinks that Blanchett and Upton’s theatre project was “a catalystic moment” that kickstarted a sense in Australia that solar power was viable and cost-effective; the country is now, he says, the biggest solar market in the developed world. Blanchett thinks of it as a “symbolic gesture” that, when added to an industry shift, “all adds up”. So she and Kennedy have known each other for ages (Blanchett recently found some old photos of his daughters when they were little) and then, last summer, Kennedy came to stay with Blanchett and her family in Cornwall. They took him to the Eden Project, which he loved, and the podcast project was started there. They visited “these old mines that are engaged in modern, clean-energy transition minerals and materials production – I’m a geek, I love that,” he says. For Blanchett, the show was “a much more primal urge. We sort of had to. I had so many questions.” I ask her about using celebrity to get attention on important issues. “Look,” she says, “if you have your two minutes in the sun, you can highlight solar technology or you can highlight an underwear line. But I’m genuine when I say that there were a lot of questions, embarrassingly ignorant questions, that I’ve been asking Danny over the decades. And I thought, ‘Well, I can’t be alone.’ When you ask a question, however ignorant or ill-informed it may be, you’re asking to open a door to a deeper understanding.” The public, with their simple questions (but why can’t we switch to wind or solar power?) often seem to be ahead of politicians when it comes to clean energy. People want environmentally friendly solutions, but the powers that be just say no. Kennedy agrees “100%” and describes a whole institutional mindset that needs to change. “For a long time, we’ve depended on these big, stodgy, 20th-century utilities where reliability was everything,” he says. “And now we’re jumping to these disruptive business models, where you’ve got distributed renewables and lots of different loads, and assets in the grid, and you need a flexible business model that’s a bit more marketplace… and the regulators can’t even contemplate it. They’re just like, ‘Oh, no. The way we do it, one big central station at a time, you’re never going to build enough wind and solar that way.’ And we’re like, ‘Yes, but that’s not how we want to build it. We want to build it on everything; every house, every roof, every garage becomes a storage system,’ and they’re like, ‘Oh, that’s all too complex.’” I can feel my gloom descending again. “Yes, but it’s just a challenge,” says Kennedy. “We live with institutions and cultural norms and bureaucracies that have trouble moving at the pace of change required, even though the technology and the consumer and the businesses are ready to deliver. That’s the tension. We could solve this.” Blanchett is keen to encourage, too. “The solution to the overwhelm is engagement,” she says. “There’s not going to be one magic bullet; it’s going to have to be governmental change, policy shifts, as well as consumer shifts and massive industry shifts. The way we do business with one another, the way we travel, it’s all of these things. At the heart of it is engagement. In the last two years, there’s been a real emotional and psychological reckoning that we’ve all been through, on top of the environmental crisis. But out of that comes a chance for renewal and we’d be crazy not to take it.” Perhaps Blanchett and Kennedy’s can-do attitude will rub off on listeners. Their articulacy and dynamism are certainly starting to make me feel a little better. Blanchett reminds me that, for every horrible environment-attacking corporate move, there has been a pro-conservation pushback. And, after all, says Kennedy, these strange, turbulent times might shake down into a more positive future. “What if we take this opportunity of this very volatile decade and we come out the other end of it better off?” he says. “Cheap, clean energy in the hands of people, not in the hands of despot lunatics that fund wars with this stuff? What about it? That’d be nice, right?” Right!

A glacial outwash lake in Tasmania’s south-west that was celebrated for its pink quartzite beach, Pedder was drowned in 1972 during the construction of dams for the Gordon hydroelectric power scheme. About 230 sq km of forest and wildlife were submerged with it. A campaign to save the lake failed, but it is now regarded as a galvanising moment that led to the creation of the world’s first green political party and the successful drive to stop the damming of the Franklin River a decade later. For decades, there has been a movement to restore the lake to its pre-impoundment health. The Lake Pedder Restoration committee, led by former Australian Greens leader Christine Milne, argues that the electricity created is not essential for energy security (because windfarms added in recent years offer more generation) and does not justify the loss of a central attraction in what became a world heritage wilderness area. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Tasmanian Liberal government disagrees. It argues Lake Pedder is an important storage site for the Gordon scheme, and helps the state run almost entirely on renewable hydro power. Hydro Tasmania, the state’s publicly owned electricity generation business, says that together the neighbouring Pedder and Gordon lakes offer Australia’s largest water storage capacity. The state energy minister, Guy Barnett, leans hard on the need to expand renewable electricity. But campaigners see an opportunity. Two of the dams that led to Pedder’s flooding are ageing and next to a fault line – a crack in the Earth’s crust – formed about 540m years ago. The fault was considered inactive when the dams were built but recent analysis says otherwise. A 2017 report by the state’s auditor general found that both dams should be considered “high risk”. Though the likelihood of an earthquake is low – there are believed to have been only three of a magnitude greater than six in at least the past 48,000 years – any rupture could lead to the flooding of areas south of Hobart, particularly the town of Huonville, which has a population of about 3,000. The auditor general suggested that Edgar Dam, which is closest to the fault, may be “susceptible to liquefaction” (collapse) while the second, Scott’s Peak Dam, was deemed “vulnerable to geological faults”. Hydro Tasmania has plans to strengthen both dams, starting with a $21m investment in Edgar Dam next year to remove the concrete face of the dam wall and put in gravel filters and supporting rock. A wave barrier will be added to the top of the dam wall. A government estimate in 2019 suggested similar work at Scott’s Peak Dam could cost $50m. Hydro Tasmania needs to ‘come clean’ on risks, says Milne The Lake Pedder Restoration committee sees this moment as a fork in the road. Head down one path and the state could spend tens of millions of dollars – Milne estimates more than $100m – to shore up the dams for the indefinite future. Choose the other and it could set an international example of ecosystem restoration on a large scale, meeting a UN call for national governments to commit to ambitious projects in this decade. It would involve gradually releasing 15m depth of water down surrounding rivers, dismantling the dams and investing in re-establishing what was lost in 1972. Crucially, the committee says, there is video evidence, shot two years ago, that the near 1km-wide quartzite beach remains intact under the water. Milne says it was “a beautiful place, and an icon in Australian conservation history” that could be recovered. “The loss of Lake Pedder is globally recognised as one the great mistakes of the 20th century in an ecological sense,” she says. “Its restoration would catapult Tasmania back into global headlights to say: this is a place of outstanding natural beauty which is now leading the world in ecosystem restoration.” Milne says the state government and Hydro Tasmania should “come clean” with the public and release their assessments of what could happen in the event of the dams’ failure. She says a benefit analysis is needed to compare decommissioning the dams with ameliorating the risk of an earthquake. Repairing them would provide what she estimates is 57 megawatts of power-generation capacity, equivalent to a small windfarm. The answer, she says, would be “a no brainer”. Neither the government nor Hydro Tasmania responded directly when asked if such analysis had been carried out. Hydro says it has an emergency plan for each of its dams and that the state emergency service, fire service and police brigade are fully briefed. “We regularly undertake joint emergency preparedness sessions with these organisations,” the organisation’s spokesperson says. The director of the Victorian University Energy Policy Centre, Bruce Mountain, believes Lake Pedder’s storage has value in the national electricity grid, but says its removal would not be an energy-security issue. He agrees with Milne that the energy it generates could be easily replaced. He says Tasmania has done next to nothing to promote rooftop solar uptake, despite its decent electricity potential, particularly in the north of the state. Mountain says a scheme that encouraged households and businesses to put up panels could fill the gap and provide cheaper power. Pedder ‘vital part’ of energy package, insists Barnett Hydro Tasmania says any decision about the future of Lake Pedder rests with the government, but argues Edgar Dam plays an essential role in ensuring adequate energy storage. A Hydro spokesperson says the lake supplies 42% of inflows to the 450MW Gordon power scheme, which is “one of the largest and most important generation assets” the utility has. The scheme is one of only two sites in the state with multi-year water-storage capacity. “As Australia transitions to renewable energy, long-duration energy storage, like that provided by Lake Pedder, is essential to fill the gaps when wind and solar power aren’t available,” a spokesperson says. Hydro also implicitly dismisses the suggestion that this moment is as decisive as the restoration committee claims. It says the Edgar Dam redevelopment will go ahead and is expected to cost the full $21m, but that after an “expert reassessment”, work on Scott’s Peak Dam is not an immediate priority. Its spokesperson says: “It is no longer appropriate to consider both projects in combination.” The Tasmanian government declined to answer questions about the potential benefits of the lake’s restoration or the earthquake risk. Barnett instead focuses on the state’s commitment to get more than 100% of its electricity from renewable energy, including meeting a legislated target of 200% – doubling current generation – by 2040. The government is committed to the Battery of the Nation and Marinus Link projects, under which the state would help replace the mainland’s coal-fired power plants by building pumped hydro storage and wind energy capacity that would send electricity across Bass Strait via a new undersea transmission cable. Both projects are yet to be funded. Should Tasmania focus on generating power for local use, developing green industries on a scale suitable for the country’s smallest state and protecting sites such as Lake Pedder? Or should it build new renewable energy infrastructure, including in some undeveloped and environmentally sensitive areas, to help the country run on clean electricity? While the Greens are focused on the urgency of the national transition to renewable energy, Milne is firmly in the former camp – as is much of the Tasmanian environmental movement. The Liberal government, despite its federal counterparts’ reluctance to embrace renewables, is in the latter. In Barnett’s words: “Tasmania is poised to be the renewable powerhouse of the country” and Lake Pedder is “a vital part of that overall package”. “In Tasmania, we want to move forward and grow our renewable energy credentials, not go backwards,” he says. Milne says there is another path, one that balances renewable energy with protection, and wants the federal government to step in. “It would be a brilliant decision for the nation’s global standing in demonstrating our stewardship of the world heritage area,” she says. “And it would guarantee community safety by removing any risk of the dams failing. It’s a win-win scenario.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/24/limits-on-renewables-will-keep-uk-energy-bills-higher-this-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T15:54:06Z","webTitle":"Limits on renewables ‘will keep UK energy bills higher this winter’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/24/limits-on-renewables-will-keep-uk-energy-bills-higher-this-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/24/limits-on-renewables-will-keep-uk-energy-bills-higher-this-winter","fields":{"headline":"Limits on renewables ‘will keep UK energy bills higher this winter’","bodyText":"Consumers will face higher energy bills than necessary next winter because of a decision by the government to limit new renewable energy generation, described as a “missed opportunity” by the renewables industry, and “outdated thinking” by a green campaign group. Ministers have decided to authorise contracts for about 12GW of new renewable energy generation, to start construction this year, with much of it likely to come on stream before next autumn. However, the renewable energy industry estimates that about 17.4GW of projects have cleared planning permission and are “shovel-ready”. The shortfall in what the government is prepared to allow, through an auctioning system, means many of these potential projects are likely not to be built this year, and consumers will be deprived of the energy savings on bills that come from renewable energy. Renewable energy is now cheaper than fossil fuels, which have soared in price during the Ukraine war. Onshore and offshore wind and solar power all command about £40 per megawatt hour on the market today, but gas-fired power generation costs about £140 per megawatt hour. Under the system of “contracts for difference”, renewable energy generators bid for contracts to produce power, but the government can set an overall limit on how much capacity it wants in the auctions, and can set limits on how much cash it is prepared to provide as incentives. On Friday, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy laid out plans for an auction, to take place on 5-6 July, allowing for 5GW of capacity to be competed for by onshore wind and solar, neither of which can take more than 3.5GW in total. The government was also expected to set a cap on offshore wind, of about 7GW of new capacity. Instead it set no cap but limited the incentive “pot” to £200m. Industry sources said that pot would amount to a de facto cap of about 7GW on new offshore wind capacity. At about 12GW, this is the biggest auction so far, but still falls far below what the industry says is possible: according to industry estimates, there are about 8.5GW of offshore windfarms that could come on stream, along with about 3.9GW of onshore wind and about 5GW of solar farms. Many groups, including unions, the CBI employers’ organisation, the National Farmers’ Union, and green and consumer groups, had called for the government to increase the amount of renewable energy generation. Research shows that renewable energy brings down energy bills for consumers: if the 12GW the government is planning had been available last winter, energy bills would have been about £100 lower for the average household. Labour said energy billpayers would suffer. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: “Once again, families are paying higher energy bills as a direct result of Conservative failure. The government is intentionally blocking access to the quickest, cheapest, cleanest forms of new power, stopping enough onshore wind and solar energy to power 3m homes. These are shovel-ready projects, with planning permission, that could be generating energy for our country at a quarter of the price of gas by the end of next year.” He added: “This terrible decision, bowing to the concerns of a few Tory backbenchers, damages investment, forfeits good jobs across the country, keeps bills high, and continues our exposure to Putin’s gas.” Doug Parr, a policy director for Greenpeace UK, said: “We have a global climate emergency which requires low carbon power, we have a cost of living crisis which requires cheap power, and we have a war in Ukraine that requires domestic power. By an amazing stroke of luck, renewables are low-carbon, cheap, domestic and can be deployed faster than the alternatives. Capacity limits on cheap renewables are outdated thinking.” The new contracts for difference auction follows a pattern of slowing growth in renewable energy in the UK, according to analysis conducted by the Liberal Democrats on government data. Total renewable capacity grew by 3.4% to 49.44GW in the year to December 2021, compared with an average annual rise of about 18% over the previous 11 years. Wera Hobhouse, the climate and energy spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said: “Under the Conservatives, the UK renewables industry has been neglected again and again. The country has been left overly reliant on gas, worsening the cost of living crisis which is hitting households hard. These projects would reduce energy bills but it needs the right political leadership from the Conservatives.” She added: “There is no question that the Conservative government must drastically increase renewable energy capacity and this starts with a much more ambitious round of auctions for clean energy projects. Recently [in the local elections], British people sent a message that the Conservatives have let them down. The lack of ambition in renewables is just another example that will leave millions vulnerable to ever-soaring energy bills.” A government spokesperson said: “The Covid pandemic and its aftermath understandably slowed infrastructure deployment across the country. That said, nearly 40% of our electricity now comes from renewable sources, and since 2010 we have delivered a 500% increase in the amount of renewable energy capacity connected to the grid. The contracts for difference scheme has been hugely successful in boosting UK energy supply and reducing our dependence on volatile fossil fuels, with competitive auctions reducing the price of offshore wind by around 65% since 2015.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2020/aug/17/garmin-fenix-6-pro-solar-review-the-solar-powered-super-watch","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2020-08-17T06:00:33Z","webTitle":"Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar review: the solar-powered super watch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/aug/17/garmin-fenix-6-pro-solar-review-the-solar-powered-super-watch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2020/aug/17/garmin-fenix-6-pro-solar-review-the-solar-powered-super-watch","fields":{"headline":"Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar review: the solar-powered super watch","bodyText":"Garmin’s latest go-anywhere, do-anything Fenix 6 Pro Solar multi-sport watch recharges from the sun, marking an important step towards the smartwatch you never need to charge. The £739.99 Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar is one of the US firm’s top-of-the-line devices, capable of lasting weeks on a charge and tracking practically any stat you’d want, plus it’s able to guide you out of forests when you’re lost. The watch is available with either a 42 or 47mm case, and in various colours and materials, here reviewed in slate grey with red accents and a 47mm case. By every dimension the Fenix 6 Pro Solar means business. At 15.1mm thick and 47mm across your wrist, it dwarfs most other smartwatches. It doesn’t feel enormous when worn, still fitting under shirt cuffs and doesn’t catch on things. It weighs 62g, which is reasonably light – the smaller Fossil Gen 5 weighs closer to 100g. With the included 23g silicone strap, the watch feels well balanced on the wrist and doesn’t slide around once done up. It is comfortable to wear with plenty of adjustment. The 22mm strap can be swapped out for either a quick-release band made by Garmin or any standard 22mm third-party strap. The 1.3in non-touchscreen is a colour transflective LCD display that is clearly visible in direct sunlight and has a backlight for seeing it in the dark. The screen is protected by scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass 3 DX and is big and clear enough to see at a glance. It is more animated than Garmin’s similar displays on watches such as the Forerunner 245, but isn’t as slick or as good-looking as the OLED screens on most smartwatches. Five physical buttons take care of controls. Most things are quick and easy to do using the up, down, select and back buttons. If you think of it operating a bit like an old-school or retro Nokia, then you get a rough idea of how it works. Scroll up or down from the watch face for a series of customisable widgets. I have smartwatch notifications first, then a series of health stats including heart, stress and sleep, temperature, solar intensity, a series of running performance widgets and so on; there are loads to choose from. Each of the buttons has a press-and-hold shortcut too. I have it set so holding the down button opens music controls, up for settings and holding the light button takes you to a rotating bunch of quick settings, including timers, alarms and Garmin Pay. Specifications Screen: 1.3in transflective MIP (260x260 pixels) Case size: 47mm Case thickness: 15.1mm Band size: standard 22mm quick release Weight: 62g body only (silicone band is 23g) Storage: 32GB Water resistance: 100 metres (10ATM) Sensors: GPS/Glonass/Galileo, compass, accelerometer, thermometer, heart rate, pulse Ox Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.2, ANT+, wifi Connections and battery life The Fenix 6 Pro Solar is much less dependent on your phone than most smartwatches; you don’t even need to pair a phone to set it up. Pairing with the Garmin Connect app enables alerts of calls, texts and other notifications, control of music, and activity syncing, all of which worked great with a variety of phones. The watch has wifi for syncing directly to the internet, downloading updates or music too. It can be plugged into a computer to sync and update via Garmin Express, which is a requirement if you want to update the built-in maps. Sans-phone, the watch will continue to track your vitals and activities for weeks with a large amount of internal storage, including fairly comprehensive analysis. You could head off into the wilderness for a week without a phone and still do everything, including mapping, which can’t be said of most smartwatches. The Fenix 6 Pro Solar lasts at least quadruple the length of most smartwatches between charges. Used just as a smartwatch with phone notifications and all the health tracking features activated it, the watch lasts nine full days and nights between charges. If you cut down on some of the health tracking, such as the pulse oximeter, wrist heart rate or other bits you can extend battery life by days (up to 14 according to Garmin). A power manager allows you to select from various pre-sets or make your own with certain features turned on or off. Running with music is the biggest battery drain. A 25-minute run with all the tracking options (GPS, heart rate, etc) while playing music via Bluetooth headphones consumes 4-5% of the battery. That’s still over nine hours total of running with music, which is enough for most people to complete a marathon. Three runs a week reduced the smartwatch battery life to closer to seven days, which is still multiple days longer than most competitors. However, that’s all without employing the watch’s hidden talent – the Power Glass covering the screen doubles as a solar charger. It works all the time, even indoors, but requires bright sunlight to meaningfully top up the battery. On a week where I spent two hours walking (with tracking and maps) and three 25-minute runs on bright British summer days I got an extra day’s battery from general smartwatch usage. The beauty is that, other than the added cost to the watch which is a not-inconsiderable £140 over the version without the solar charging, there’s no downside to the Power Glass as it’s fully transparent to the eye. You just see the screen and a slim strip that looks like bezel. Sustainability The Fenix 6 Pro Solar is generally repairable, but Garmin typically replaces damaged devices with refurbished units for a fee. The battery is rated to last a few years of frequent charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% capacity, but is not user replaceable. The screen is covered in Corning’s scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass 3 DX, similar to a smartphone. Garmin offers trade-in schemes for some lines and complies with WEEE and other local electronics recycling law. General Health tracking The Fenix 6 Pro Solar has comprehensive health tracking features. An excellent optical heart rate monitor on the back works continuously through the day, alerting you to abnormally high or low beats per minute and recording your resting and active heart rates. It measures Pulse Ox (oxygenation of the blood) both during the day and while asleep, respiration rate, stress, body temperature, fall or incident detection and many more. The only thing it doesn’t have is ECG for tracking heart arrhythmia. Garmin’s body battery system helps you make sense of it all, combining stress, sleep, heart rate variability and other data into a simple in-out system. You charge up your body with good sleep and deplete it with stress, activity and daily life. If you’re about balanced you’re doing a good job, but it’s easy to spot when you’re struggling or not doing enough exercise. Sleep tracking is extensive, including light, deep and REM sleep stages, respiration and Pulse Ox tracking, which together can show signs of issues such as sleep apnoea. The data is presented in easy-to-read graphs on the phone or a widget on the watch. Then there’s your standard step, calories, floors and so on, including move reminders. Sport, training and adventuring Comprehensive sport tracking covers a list of over 30 activities, but the main ones are running in its various indoor and outdoor forms, cycling, swimming, walking, hiking, skiing, golf and gym sessions of various activities with on-screen animations showing you how to do them. The watch will handle triathlons, but as a runner I focused on hitting the pavement. The Fenix 6 Pro Solar’s outdoor running tracking was first class. It got a GPS lock within seconds, monitored every stat I could want, had a clearly readable display with only the info I wanted on it, gave me pace and lap alerts, performance analysis after 1.5km and handled intervals and more advanced training plans with aplomb. The watch is noticeably larger and heavier on your wrist than something like the Forerunner 245, requiring me to tighten the strap to stop it sliding around. At the end of each run it gives you an aerobic and anaerobic training score, plus an analysis of your training load over the last seven days. The recovery, Vo2 Max and race predictor functions were more accurate than other Garmin watches I have tested too. PacePro allows you to map out a race course and get pace suggestions in real time on the watch adjusted for elevation and other factors to help you hit your desired time, once races are open again. Walking maps were very useful too, providing maps with trails and other features that weren’t visible on Google Maps, making it more effective than a phone. Moving the map around can be a bit tedious with buttons, but is straightforward with practice. The altimeter, barometer and compass, plus maps of the whole of Europe mean you can go hiking just about anywhere. If you need maps for other regions you can buy them and upload them through Garmin Express. Apps The Fenix 6 Pro Solar can run third-party apps downloaded from the Connect IQ store. There are plenty of small utilities and widgets, apps such as Uber and Strava, music services including Spotify, Deezer and Amazon Music, and buckets of watch faces. The Spotify app works well. It can download up to 2,000 songs for offline playback via wifi or control music on your smartphone. Not many smartwatches have offline Spotify playback, so having it for runs is a big plus for subscribers. Garmin Pay is also available for contactless payment on the go. It is not supported by many banks in the UK, but does support Curve, which allows you to bind most credit or debit cards to it. Payments are secured by pin and could be a lifesaver for use on public transport or buying a drink when running without a phone or credit card. Observations The watch can vibrate and has basic beeps and tones, which work well for the various alarms, timers and activities. Price The Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar has an RRP of £739.99 and comes in either 42 or 47mm sizes. The watch is also available without solar charging as the Fenix 6 Pro costing £599.99, with solar charging but without music, maps and wifi, as the Fenix 6 Solar costing £649.99 or in a larger 51mm version called the Fenix 6X Pro Solar costing £849.99. For comparison, the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music costs £299.99, the Forerunner 945 costs £519.99, Suunto 9 Baro costs £539, the Coros Vertix costs $599 (£460), the Polar Vantage V Titan costs £519, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 costs £269 and the Apple Watch Series 5 costs £399. Verdict The Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar is the do-anything, go-anywhere watch for those that need a smartwatch while stuck to a desk during the day, but then dump everything and go climb a mountain, do a triathlon or simply trek into the middle of nowhere at the weekends. Or aspire to do those things. It is very much the kitchen-sink of multi-sport watches, which means most of it is total overkill if you’re just a runner, just a cyclist, just a swimmer or just looking for a long-lasting smartwatch. But if you do more than one thing, or like the idea of being able to jump out of an aeroplane in the middle of Europe and still find your way home, this is the watch for you. It is really easy to live with and looks the part. A rugged, yet stylish sports watch that states to the outside world: “I do more than just the day job”. Those with smaller wrists will struggle with the 47mm version, but the 42mm version is smaller than many smartwatches. Garmin’s Power Glass offers a glimpse of the solar-powered future. It’s not quite the holy grail of a smartwatch you never have to charge, but made a small but material difference to the battery life. Having to charge it less than once a week is still a killer feature for everything this watch can track and do. It is worth noting you’re paying an extra £140 for the solar-charging technology versus the same watch without it, which is a fair sum. It is certainly not cheap, and definitely overkill for most. But if you want the ultimate outdoor adventure smartwatch, the Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar is it. Pros: tracks everything under the sun, long battery life, solar charging, phone notifications, Garmin Pay, full offline mapping, offline Spotify, Bluetooth, wifi, 100m water resistance, real buttons, accurate GPS Cons: expensive, big, limited Garmin Pay bank support, limited smartwatch features compared to Apple Watch/Wear OS/Galaxy Watch, no touchscreen, screen fairly basic compared to the best smartwatches Other reviews Garmin Forerunner 245 Music review: a runner’s best friend Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 review: the best smartwatch for Android Fossil Gen 5 review: Google’s Wear OS smartwatch at its best Apple Watch Series 5 review: the king of smartwatches"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/may/15/10-best-uk-birdwatching-breaks-birdwatchers","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-15T15:00:33Z","webTitle":"10 of the best UK birdwatching breaks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/may/15/10-best-uk-birdwatching-breaks-birdwatchers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/may/15/10-best-uk-birdwatching-breaks-birdwatchers","fields":{"headline":"10 of the best UK birdwatching breaks","bodyText":"Rathlin Island, County Antrim Puffins prefer to nest on uninhabited islands, including the Farne Islands and Isle of May, but they make an exception for Rathlin.

A summer of wildfires, drought and record heatwaves fuelled by climate breakdown has combined with soaring gas and electricity prices, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, to inject a new urgency into the switch to alternative, renewable sources. From solar panels in the Netherlands to biomass burners in Spain, communities across Europe are increasingly making, consuming and selling their own energy, a trend the EU sees as vital if the bloc is to meet its climate targets. According to the latest data, 2 million Europeans are now involved in 7,000 local energy communities across the continent, with numbers growing rapidly since EU directives promoting clean energy and energy communities were introduced in 2018 and 2019. They will be key to Europe’s green transition because, as heat pumps replace gas boilers and electric vehicles supplant internal combustion engines, highly centralised electricity production and distribution systems – power stations and grids – will simply not be able to adequately handle the huge increase in demand. “At least, not on their own,” said Gonçalo Mendes, a senior researcher and energy systems modeller from LUT University in Finland and part of a European Commission-funded initiative, GRETA, working to define and enable what it has dubbed “energy citizenship”. The only way forward, Mendes said, is “to decentralise more and more, produce and consume more energy locally with sources like solar and wind – and boost storage and smart solutions for efficient energy management”. All of which means involving ordinary citizens. Some communities have operated successfully for years. The Bera Bera neighbourhood of San Sebastián in Spain has had a cooperative providing hot water and community heating to its more than 500 members since 1985. One of the projects being studied by GRETA, the collective, known as Ur Beroa, has since moved with the times, abandoning heating oil for natural gas and adding a cogeneration system – to produce both heat and electricity, which it sells to the grid – 10 years ago, followed by a biomass boiler and solar panels. “The first target for solar is self-consumption for 100 families,” said board member Juan Luis Llorens. “The next step, next year, will be green hydrogen, to replace part of our current gas consumption. The goal now is obviously complete decarbonisation.” Llorens said Ur Beroa had been able to freeze its members’ heating and hot water bills this year thanks to revenues from electricity sales, and was offering “the cheapest prices in town. My son lives outside Bera Bera, and his bills have exploded”. But if price is a big motivator for members, other aspects play a major part. “We make our own decisions,” he said. “For those who care about the environment, we’re making progress collectively, in a way that would be difficult individually. There’s a sense of having control of something that’s important in your life.” As things stand, Europe is “nowhere near” meeting its target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55% in the next eight years, said Mendes, unless “we work urgently on the role everyday citizens will have to play. And to get there, we need to explicitly recognise the social side of the energy transition.” Lurian Klein, an academic expert on energy communities now working with Cleanwatts, said all the research on peer-to-peer energy sharing models showed they were “far more accessible, democratised, collaborative and socially just” than traditional top-down energy markets. “Fundamentally, they thrive on social interconnectedness among end-users, rather than being based on competing economic self-interests,” he said. “They reinforce positive social values, really strengthen empowerment and social engagement.” Fortunately, technology is now making it possible. “A lot is coming together,” said Michael Pinto of CleanWatts, which has arranged financing, designed and installed systems to produce, store and trade electricity, as well as control and optimise consumption, for 100 communities in Portugal – with 2,000 more inquiries waiting. “You have electricity needs that are going to double and grids that won’t cope. But you now also have sustainables – solar panels – that are competitive now, and smart technology to measure, manage and balance production, storage and consumption efficiently.” That means the options are basically either “blackouts and massive volatility, and completely rebuilding national grids”, Pinto said, or “changing the way electricity is produced, delivered and consumed. More agile, more resourceful. That’s local energy communities.” EU directives on energy communities are being incorporated into national law around the bloc at different speeds and with different incentives, but an ideal starting scenario for a new project, Pinto said, was “say, a big warehouse: large, big roof, low energy use”. In Portugal, that warehouse – projects also involve barracks, football clubs and village schools – can expect 20% to 30% off its electricity bills; in Italy it would get cashback. And the 80% excess it produces but does not use can be sold to locals, and beyond. “There are tens of thousands of municipalities in the EU,” said Pinto. “There are 8,000 in Italy alone – about 5,000 of them with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants. The potential here is just enormous. But it has to be – the challenge is enormous, too.” In the Netherlands, Steven Volkers of Grunneger Power in Groningen, which has 2,500 members, said the decade-old cooperative was born of people’s “passion and frustration” at the slow pace of the green transition. The cooperative owns two solar parks totalling 10,000-plus panels, as well as smaller sites on homes and buildings across the city, generating green electricity that it also sells to a sustainable energy provider with profits invested back into the collective. It also offers help with insulation and installations. Dutch government targets – 50% community-owned and 30% sustainably generated electricity – underline a belief that “we won’t reach sustainability targets without citizen participation”, Volkers said. Elsewhere, the potential is still being explored. In Bologna, Italy, a green energy community project (GECO) involving the university, municipality, residents’ associations, the regional energy agency and other bodies has been under way since 2019 in the north-eastern district of Pilastro-Roveri. “What’s interesting is this is actually two districts in one,” said Martina Massari of Bologna University’s architecture department, which is leading the university’s involvement in the GRETA project. “Pilastro is a 1960s residential area – 6,800 people, lots of social housing, mixed populations. “Roveri, across the rail tracks, is industrial, lots of factories, warehouses – and the EU’s largest solar power plant on industrial rooftops. They’re slowly making the housing blocks more energy-efficient, which is essential, and interest among residents is growing rapidly as energy prices rise.” Carlo Alberto Nucci, a professor of electrical power systems at the university and technical lead for the project, said it was a pilot, “like a living lab”, and recent government incentives for local energy communities in Italy would make a significant difference. “What’s fundamental is that we start to produce energy where it’s consumed, and we can do that now because of renewables,” he said, adding that ultimately, about 20% of energy produced in cities should come from energy communities. Smart meters, connected appliances and end-user apps will be critical to the system’s success, Nucci said. “A smart app can automatically switch on your home devices, choosing the best moment for you – and for the efficiency of the whole community – to use your washing machine, for example. “Much of this is really about the concept that energy is of value, that information about it is really important, and that virtuous energy behaviours absolutely can make a difference – to both individuals and the community. This is all quite new.” Bologna’s deputy mayor, Anna Lisa Boni, said the project was “clearly a fantastic idea” but was being held up, in part, by a delayed legislative process at national level and by bureaucracy. “The legal framework is very complex, the devil’s in the detail – what happens with the various partner’s VAT systems, for example,” she said. Ultimately, Mendes said, more than 80% of EU households could play an active part in the energy transition: “Energy citizenship, we call it. Obviously, awareness and engagement levels will differ. But it’s all about agency.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/apr/03/more-details-emerge-of-prince-andrews-alleged-links-with-banker-selman-turk","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-03T17:34:45Z","webTitle":"More details emerge of Prince Andrew’s alleged links with banker Selman Turk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/03/more-details-emerge-of-prince-andrews-alleged-links-with-banker-selman-turk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/apr/03/more-details-emerge-of-prince-andrews-alleged-links-with-banker-selman-turk","fields":{"headline":"More details emerge of Prince Andrew’s alleged links with banker Selman Turk","bodyText":"Prince Andrew had known an alleged fraudster for at least six months before receiving more than £1m in disputed payments from the man, it has been reported. The Duke of York was introduced to Selman Turk via a mutual contact, Tarek Kaituni, a Libyan-born convicted gun smuggler, in May or June 2019 at Windsor Castle, and held subsequent meetings, the Sunday Telegraph reports. Turk received an award from Andrew at a Pitch@Palace event – a Dragons’ Den-style project for entrepreneurs created by the duke – in November 2019. Nine days after the event, Andrew received £750,000 from Nebahat Isbilen, a Turkish millionaire and wife of a former leading politician, who is now taking Turk to the high court in London, alleging that he defrauded her out of nearly £40m. She alleges that Turk told her to make the payment to Andrew in return for assistance with a passport application. The prince, who has declined to comment on the reports, repaid the sum about 16 months after he received it, once Isbilen’s lawyers contacted him. It is through these legal proceedings that Andrew’s connection with Turk was revealed, including further payments of £350,000 received from Alphabet Capital, which lawyers have told the court was “a fraudulent and covert front” to make payments to those “associated” with Turk. Andrew’s reported introduction to Turk in May or June 2019 is another piece of the puzzle of the latest controversy to embroil him. It still remains unclear as to whether he was aware of the money entering his personal bank account or what it was for. His spokesperson declined to comment on the most recent reports. Kaituni is reported to have first introduced Andrew to Turk at a birthday celebration at Windsor Castle sometime between May and June in 2019. Turk and Kaituni subsequently met Andrew in London on at least two occasions, including at a dinner with potential investors at Turk’s apartment in South Kensington on 5 December 2019, the Telegraph said, citing sources. Turk later shared pictures of him and Kaituni inside what is believed to be Frogmore House, the royal residence in Windsor Great Park, during a visit in February 2020. The Guardian has been unable to verify the claims. Another court document, dated April 2021, says Turk disputes Isbilen’s allegations: “He disagrees with her portrayal of the facts, including as to her understanding of the various dealings with her assets. He states that much of what has happened is the result of Mrs Isbilen’s status as a politically exposed person and the consequential difficulty in dealing with her assets.” Andrew’s connections with Kaituni, whom he is said to have first met in 2005, have been widely reported. Kaituni, who was convicted of attempting to smuggle a submachine gun from Holland to France in 2005, is reported to have facilitated meetings between Andrew and the former Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi. He was reported to have given Andrew’s eldest daughter, Beatrice, an £18,000 gold and diamond necklace after the prince invited him to her 21st birthday party in Spain in August 2009, months before Andrew allegedly lobbied a British company on his behalf. Kaituni is also reported to have attended the wedding of Andrew’s youngest daughter, Eugenie, in 2018. It emerged on Saturday that one of the duke’s senior aides had told bankers that the £750,000 payment from Isbilen was for Beatrice’s wedding. The Daily Mail obtained a transcript of a phone call on 14 November 2019 between Andrew’s former aide Amanda Thirsk and bankers acting for Isbilen. In the call, the bankers queried the purpose of the £750,000 transfer from Isbilen’s account to the duke’s personal account at Coutts, and Thirsk, who was a senior member of the royal household at the time but no longer works there, said: “It’s a gift for the wedding, a wedding gift.” The duke’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and Eugenie are also named in court documents related to Isbilen’s case against Turk. It is said Ferguson received £225,000 and Eugenie £25,000. Ferguson’s case is that she received the funds from Turk’s business after he took on a debt owed to her by Pegasus, a solar power company, which owed her payment for her role as ambassador for the firm. Her spokesperson said: “The duchess was completely unaware of the allegations that have since emerged against Mr Turk. She is naturally concerned by what has been alleged against him.” Eugenie told the Sunday Telegraph: “I know neither Mrs Isbilen nor Mr Turk.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/apr/03/prince-andrew-the-banker-and-a-mystery-750000-wedding-gift","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-03T05:00:12Z","webTitle":"Prince Andrew, the banker … and a mystery £750,000 ‘wedding gift’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/03/prince-andrew-the-banker-and-a-mystery-750000-wedding-gift","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/apr/03/prince-andrew-the-banker-and-a-mystery-750000-wedding-gift","fields":{"headline":"Prince Andrew, the banker … and a mystery £750,000 ‘wedding gift’","bodyText":"When the Turkish entrepreneur Selman Turk launched a new digital bank three years ago, he was entering a crowded market of online start-ups hoping to grab business from the traditional banks. It seemed there was little to distinguish the new London-based venture, Heyman AI, from a host of other contenders. It had a rudimentary website, meagre funding compared to some of its digital rivals and no banking licence. “We are building a good bank for good people,” said its website. A footnote added that it was “in the application process” to become a bank in the UK. But just seven months after the new venture was launched, a besuited Turk was on stage with the Duke of York at St James’s Palace collecting a people’s choice award in the prestigious Pitch@Palace event. The competition on 6 November 2019 was Prince Andrew’s version of the BBC show Dragons’ Den, but with a priceless royal cachet. It was a spectacular coup for former Goldman Sachs banker Turk and his fledgling bank, but did not secure the future of the firm, which was wound up in September last year. It emerged last week that Turk, 35, is being sued by a Turkish millionairess, Nebahat Evyap Isbilen, 77, who claims she was defrauded by him. She is seeking the return of about £38m. He disputes the allegations. Turk helped manage Isbilen’s financial affairs, and the court documents claim Turk instigated a payment of £750,000 to be made to Prince Andrew, just nine days after he picked up the award at St James’s Palace. The money, from Isbilen’s private bank account, has since been repaid, but raises new questions for Prince Andrew: were he and his advisers aware the payment was linked to Turk, and what was the money for? Prince Andrew is not central to the complex high court proceedings and is not accused of any wrongdoing. In her statements to the high court, Isbilen said she was told by Turk that the payment was a gift for Prince Andrew after it was claimed he helped arrange a replacement passport. She also said she had seen an email from Turk to her private bank, Hampden &amp; Co, stating the payment was a wedding gift for Princess Beatrice, who married the property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in July 2020. Isbilen has told the court she considered the claims concerning Prince Andrew’s purported role in arranging a passport or that the money transfer was a wedding gift were both false. In an extraordinary transcript of a call published by the Daily Mail yesterday, Amanda Thirsk, Prince Andrew’s former private secretary and the former director of Pitch@Palace, allegedly told a banker from Hampden &amp; Co conducting compliance checks that she believed the money was a gift. She is claimed to have said: “I understand it’s a gift for the wedding…What she [Beatrice] and her family decide to do with it is really to do with them, isn’t it?” Thirsk told the Mail she could not recollect the call, but would not have been involved in anything improper. It has also been reported that Prince Andrew’s former wife, Sarah Ferguson, also received payments of at least £225,000 from Turk via a company called Alphabet Capital, said to be in connection with payment she was owed for her work with a solar power company. Her spokesperson has said she was completely unaware of the allegations which have now emerged. Isbilen is a member of the Turkish family that owns the Evyap group of companies, which has a range of soap and personal care brands. Her husband, Ilhan Isbilen, is the former deputy leader of the ruling AK party, and has been a political prisoner in Turkey since 2015. Isbilen says she gave Turk effective control of funds of $87.5m (£66.7m) and that he “dishonestly and systematically” abused the trust she placed in him. She said she had limited ability to understand English and required help to move her assets out of Turkey. She claims he dishonestly mismanaged her funds. Pitch@Palace was founded by the Duke of York in 2014 to “amplify and accelerate the work of entrepreneurs”. The programme had aimed to help businesspeople “make connections” and secure investment. Its future was, however, in peril at the time Turk picked up the award for his bank. Prince Andrew had given his notorious BBC Two Newsnight interview 10 days after the awards ceremony, triggering a public backlash. Companies including KPMG, Barclays, Bosch and Standard Chartered subsequently ended their sponsorship of Pitch@Palace. Its future activities are now under review. Prince Andrew’s spokesperson has said there will be no comment on an ongoing court case."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/apr/03/high-energy-using-industries-fear-lack-of-support-from-uk-ministers","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-03T15:41:35Z","webTitle":"High energy-using industries fear lack of support from UK ministers ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/03/high-energy-using-industries-fear-lack-of-support-from-uk-ministers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/apr/03/high-energy-using-industries-fear-lack-of-support-from-uk-ministers","fields":{"headline":"High energy-using industries fear lack of support from UK ministers ","bodyText":"Britain’s strategic heavy industries have warned they risk being left high and dry by a lack of support in the government’s upcoming energy strategy, warning that failure to follow European countries’ measures to reduce gas and electricity costs will put UK businesses at risk. The government is expected to outline long-awaited proposals this week for a once-in-a-generation drive to invest in nuclear power and possibly more onshore wind and solar power, as well as approving continued North Sea oil and gas exploration. The plan expected to be set out by ministers on Thursday has been delayed amid disagreements in the cabinet about which technologies to back, including a fraught battle over new nuclear power plants, with the Treasury thought to be reluctant to invest large sums in costly projects. One industry source said heavy energy users were “not expecting anything” to help them on gas or electricity, the latter of which can cost up to 60% more than the price paid by European competitors. Earlier this month, Boris Johnson promised measures to “address the needs of British steel, British ceramics and the whole of British industry” but the business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, told MPs last week that the government had already taken steps to support industrial firms facing soaring costs. Against a backdrop of ballooning energy bills for strategically important companies and major manufacturing firms, energy intensive industries told the Guardian that the mixed messages had left them fearing they will receive minimal help, or none at all. Richard Warren, a spokesperson for the trade body UK Steel, said it had “long urged the government to reduce the politically and regulatory controlled elements of electricity bills in line with action taken by governments elsewhere”. Simply renewing a compensation scheme that gives electricity intensive industries a refund on the cost of the UK’s emissions trading scheme, but which expired on Friday, would be only a “partial solution”. UK Steel said the industry “needs full compensation for the costs of carbon in electricity, an increase in the relief on renewables levies, and similar reductions in network costs as already provided by governments in France, Germany, and the Netherlands”. Stephen Elliott, the chief executive of the Chemical Industries Association, warned that prolonged high energy costs could see factories reduce operations or foreign-owned firms take their business elsewhere. “I can’t stand in front of Kwasi Kwarteng and say that businesses will be shutting a week on Thursday, but I can’t say they’ll be viable and running full tilt, either,” he said. “Things are getting tighter as our ability to pass through cost to our customers is becoming increasingly more difficult. “Our continental European competitors are getting more relief [following the EU’s recent crisis framework enabling more state aid in this area]. If we leave it to the moment when a chemical plant shuts, restarting those is a very challenging thing to do from a health and safety perspective responsibly.” Over the weekend, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, rejected calls for the UK to consider rationing energy, as ministers explore ways to boost Britain’s resilience to international shocks to oil gas markets after the Russian invasion of Ukraine led to record increases in costs. Kwarteng told the Sunday Telegraph that nuclear energy and offshore wind turbines would play a bigger role in energy production, with as many as seven new nuclear plants by 2050. Chemicals companies use disproportionately large amounts of electricity in their processes. Inovyn, a chlorine manufacturer that operates from a plant in Runcorn on the banks of the Mersey, uses as much electricity as the nearby city of Liverpool. Elliott warned that some businesses owned by overseas companies might reconsider their investment in the UK if nothing is done about energy prices. “If you were to ask investors in chemicals around the world, there are good reasons for coming to the UK, but the negative factor has always been energy costs. So UK sites of foreign parents are always marked down on that front and will increasingly be so. Please don’t leave it until we are shutting, because by then it’s probably too late.” Elliott wrote to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in March calling for greater support for UK companies to pay carbon emissions costs, pointing to measures taken by European countries. A BEIS spokesperson said: “We will continue to support energy intensive industries with the costs of energy, and will set out details of further support soon. “Volatile gas prices are a global issue, underscoring the importance of building a strong, homegrown renewable energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.” •This article was amended on 4 April 2022 to add a comment from BEIS"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lexus-australia-new-luxury/2022/jul/27/an-experts-guide-to-australias-electric-vehicle-market","type":"article","sectionId":"lexus-australia-new-luxury","sectionName":"Lexus Australia: New luxury","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T06:18:27Z","webTitle":"An expert’s guide to Australia’s electric vehicle market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lexus-australia-new-luxury/2022/jul/27/an-experts-guide-to-australias-electric-vehicle-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lexus-australia-new-luxury/2022/jul/27/an-experts-guide-to-australias-electric-vehicle-market","fields":{"headline":"An expert’s guide to Australia’s electric vehicle market","bodyText":"Electric vehicles (EVs) aren’t just a passing trend in Australia. As people seek more environmentally responsible and affordable ways to travel, they are likely to become the norm. Research carried out by the not-for-profit organisation Climateworks says 50-76% of new car sales in Australia must be electric by 2030 if Australia is to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. There’s a long way to go: with 6752 EVs sold in the first three months of 2022, EV sales accounted for only 2.6% of the new motor vehicle market. However, Rupert Posner, the sustainable economies lead at Climateworks, is confident demand will continue to rise. EVs will increasingly appeal to three types of people, he says: fans of new technology who are looking for a better driving experience, conscious environmentalists who want to do the right thing, and frequent drivers who value reduced running and maintenance costs. “Increasingly, we’re going to find that anyone who needs a car is the ideal person to purchase an electric vehicle,” Posner says. If you’re thinking of making the switch, here are the answers to a few questions you might have. What are zero and low-emissions technologies? Zero emissions isn’t the same thing as low emissions. “There’s a spectrum of what your emissions levels could mean,” Posner says. “Low could just mean a more fuel-efficient vehicle that still runs on petrol. Low emissions is better than high emissions, of course, but zero emissions is what we want to be moving toward.” The Lexus NX 450h+ is a great example of low-emissions technology for people who want to go electric but with the security of a petrol back-up. It’s a plug-in hybrid EV (PHEV) that minimises fuel consumption by offering the driver a choice between electric and petrol power (producing zero emissions when it’s running on electric), and is the first PHEV from Lexus to be sold in Australia. Are EVs the answer to all our transport issues? Posner cautions that EVs aren’t a cure-all. “If every trip we did was in an electric vehicle, we might reduce greenhouse emissions but we’d still be contributing to congestion and other community problems.” Being more intentional about what trips you use your car for ultimately benefits the quality of life for others. “We do need to be looking at shifting the way that we travel. Walking, cycling, and catching public transport is still a really important part of developing a transport strategy for Australia.” Overseas model shown *** Can EVs help the grid? Posner highlights the role EVs can play in supporting the electricity grid by acting as batteries on wheels. “If we have significant numbers of electric vehicles around the country, and we plug them in, we can use that to reduce electricity rates for the whole community,” he says. “This can reduce the need for extra infrastructure, the need for extra power generation.” Over time, the increased presence of EVs in the market can help lower Australia’s dependence on foreign oil, support the electricity network, and decarbonise the economy. Why is a fully electric option better than a hybrid vehicle? A battery EV (BEV) doesn’t burn fossil fuels, doesn’t need an exhaust, spark plugs, clutch, or gears to operate, and is less noisy to run. “There’s no doubt that a hybrid is better than an internal combustion engine unit that’s a fully petrol-powered vehicle, in the same way that a gas-fired power station is better than a coal-fired power station,” Posner says. “But still, solar power is even better … You want to encourage people to be going to the best option rather than something that’s a slight improvement.” In terms of EVs, the best option in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be a fully electric vehicle that is charged using renewable energy. Last year, Lexus launched its first BEV, the UX 300e – the first of multiple EV designs due to be released in the coming years. Its high capacity battery allows up to 360km of travel on a single charge. The barriers to owning an EV in Australia Australian governments don’t have policies in place to guarantee a high supply of vehicles. “One of the challenges is that electric vehicles are mostly sent to markets where governments have requirements to reduce auto greenhouse gas emissions,” Posner says. “Unless Australia also has policies like that, we’re just not going to get the same supply.” But the recent election of a new federal government provides grounds for hope, Posner says. “I’m optimistic that there will be more incentives and more encouragement for manufacturers to bring more electric vehicles into Australia.” Australia doesn’t have a vehicle manufacturing industry any more and relies on overseas supply. “We’re largely dependent on vehicles that are manufactured overseas,” Posner says. “Certainly, the need for governments to work together to try and drive supply is important. From a consumer point of view, every day we are seeing new models that are going to be coming to Australia. So consumers should be excited that there are so many options and that almost every manufacturer is looking to shift to electric vehicles as we go forward.” Overseas model shown *** The benefits of owning an EV in Australia EVs are better for the environment. BEVs have zero exhaust emissions, and their batteries can be recycled and repurposed to keep their environmental impact low. “We’re also shifting from pure environmental benefit to a better product,” Posner says. Range anxiety needn’t be a concern. “Even petrol tanks run out if you don’t plan ahead,” Posner says. “Meanwhile, we’re seeing many more charging stations being built around the country. The reality is that, for most of us, we don’t do 400 kilometres of driving every day. If you plug it in at home, overnight, you know, you’ve got more than adequate charge to do what you need.” When asked for practical tips on how to gain confidence shopping in the EV market, Posner encourages people to go and get some hands-on knowledge and experience: Do a test drive. “There are lots of manufacturers who are producing EVs. Try them out and you’ll see it’s not that complicated, different, or difficult.” Speak to friends who already own an EV. “Find out what other peoples’ experiences have been. As more models come out into the market, we’ll likely know someone who has an EV. As a result, we’ll see a big shift in the uptake of the vehicles, too.” Posner predicts that in the next five years, many more vehicles in the Australian market will end up being electric. The benefit of this shift in the auto industry? Not only do you get a better return on investment if you swap an internal combustion engine vehicle for an EV, but the vehicles themselves are a pleasure to drive. “This isn’t about sacrificing,” Posner says. “This is about fabulous products that are really fun and exciting to use, offering great performance alongside being better for the community you live in.” Discover a new definition of luxury with the Lexus electrified range."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2021/nov/03/what-happened-at-cop26-day-three-at-a-glance","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-03T18:55:02Z","webTitle":"What happened at Cop26 – day three at a glance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/03/what-happened-at-cop26-day-three-at-a-glance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/nov/03/what-happened-at-cop26-day-three-at-a-glance","fields":{"headline":"What happened at Cop26 – day three at a glance","bodyText":"Country pledges at Cop26 would limit global temperature rises to below 2C, the first time the world has been on such a trajectory, according to research from the University of Melbourne.

The finance pledge, known as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), will mean that by 2050 all assets managed by the institutions will be aligned with net zero emissions.

With nearly all ballots counted, political newcomer Robert Golob gained nearly 35% of the vote for his Freedom Movement launched in January. He is expected to form a government with the support of smaller leftwing groups, ending the hard-right government led by Janša, who styled himself on Hungary’s autocratic leader, Viktor Orbán, and took nearly 24% of the vote. Pro-EU politicians reacted with delight to Golob’s victory, which emerged as Emmanuel Macron beat his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen to take a second term as French president. “These results are a bloody nose for illiberals and a chance to make Europe stronger,” said Stéphane Séjourné, a Macron ally, who leads centrist MEPs in the European parliament. “The EU [and] Slovenia is better off without the rightwing populist Janez Janša, who attacked the free press [and] democratic institutions in Slovenia,” Séjourné said. The leader of the Socialist group in the European parliament, Iratxe García Pérez, said Slovenians had “chosen change” and no longer wanted the “populist and authoritarian” Janša leadership. “The Freedom Movement now has the opportunity to usher in a new era with a centre-left government that fully supports EU values,” she wrote. During Janša’s two-year government, Slovenia has experienced the sharpest democratic decline in eastern Europe and Central Asia, according to Freedom House. While the NGO noted that political rights and freedoms were “generally respected” it said Janša’s government had made “continued attempts to undermine the rule of law and democratic institutions, including the media and judiciary”. Florian Bieber at the University of Graz said it was a positive result for the EU. “Janez Janša has been a very disruptive figure, not just in Slovenia” he said. “He encouraged the idea that he could export [Orbán’s] model of government to other countries and that has certainly been defeated in Slovenia and that is encouraging, so it suggests the limits of Orbán’s appeal.” Nika Kovač, director of the 8 March Institute, an NGO that ran a voter mobilisation drive, said that on Monday “we woke up in a radically different Slovenia. It was a decision about which country we want to live in. I think people were voting not just for the party, but for the direction we need to go.” Turnout reached 70% of the 1.7 million electorate, much higher than the 52% of the previous election in 2018. Kovač said she had faced online abuse, including death threats and attacks on her appearance, from Janša supporters. The 8 March Institute that she leads is calling on the new government to pass an “omnibus law” that would repeal 11 decisions taken by the National Assembly during Janša’s term, including measures to safeguard the autonomy of police and bolster the rights of environmental campaigners in court proceedings. Janša, leader of the Slovenian Democratic party, returned to power in March 2020, after two previous stints in office. He regained power when the previous centre-left prime minister resigned, saying he did not have enough votes to pass important legislation. The rightwing populist, who used Twitter to launch ad-hominem attacks on journalists, soon ran into conflict with the EU. For much of 2021 his government withheld funds from the Slovenian Press Agency, resulting in the organisation losing 10% of its journalists. He criticised the judiciary and claimed without evidence that the constitutional court was responsible for coronavirus deaths, after judges ruled that his government’s Covid-19 legislation was incompatible with the constitution. “He was pretending he was Orbán who has an outright majority, which he [Janša] never had, so in a certain way he was overplaying his hand,” said Bieber. The political scientist added that Janša remained within the margin of his previous electoral score, so “it’s not that he lost a lot”. Janša was one of the first EU leaders to visit Kyiv after the outbreak of war, but this failed to help him at the polls, said Bieber. “There is a limit for populist nationalist conservative politics in Slovenia. That you can’t really win elections with that alone.” During the campaign Golob promised to restore “normality” and billed the elections as a “referendum on democracy”. The former energy executive, who ran a company promoting solar power, is also calling for a green energy transition. Analysts say it remains to be seen whether Golob can overcome the difficulties that have beset previous political startups on the centre-left, which have fizzled out amid infighting and organisational problems. “The problem with these kind of parties is that they don’t have apparatus, they don’t have experience, they don’t have knowledge how to run governmental policies and this after a year or two could create a lot of tensions,” said political analyst Miha Kovač, who is the father of Nika Kovač. “There is a serious danger that Slovenia will become politically unstable in a year or two,” he said. Meanwhile Janša, one of Slovenia’s longest-serving politicians, is expected to continue to lead his party. “He is irremovable, he is there for eternity,” said Miha Kovač. “He is the most experienced person in the Slovenian parliament. He will take a holiday now, I assume, and then he will wait for his chance to jump in when he sees the first sign of governmental coalition falling apart.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/30/agls-coal-implosion-shows-what-a-disorderly-transition-to-clean-energy-looks-like","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-30T07:31:10Z","webTitle":"AGL’s coal implosion shows what a disorderly transition to clean energy looks like","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/30/agls-coal-implosion-shows-what-a-disorderly-transition-to-clean-energy-looks-like","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/30/agls-coal-implosion-shows-what-a-disorderly-transition-to-clean-energy-looks-like","fields":{"headline":"AGL’s coal implosion shows what a disorderly transition to clean energy looks like","bodyText":"The spectacular implosion at AGL Energy, Australia’s biggest corporate greenhouse gas polluter, has been years in the making and should have ramifications across Australia’s political and business classes. The short story is that this is what a disorderly transition to a clean economy looks like – the kind that we have long been warned will happen if governments don’t plan for the future. AGL had planned to “demerge” itself into two separate companies, with one taking responsibility for more than 4.5 million retail customers and the other its electricity generators – notably, its three ageing coal-fired power plants, the last of which isn’t due to shut until 2045. The retail business should have a bright future. The coal plants don’t. The idea was to separate them to boost the former by separating it from the declining value of the latter. AGL management said the split would “unlock value for shareholders”. The demerger was due to go to a shareholder vote next month, and needed 75% support to pass. AGL management has now conceded it has no chance of reaching that, having been stymied by the software billionaire and renewable energy investor Mike Cannon-Brookes, who earlier this month took control of 11.3% of its shares. Cannon-Brookes wants the company to stay as one, shut its coal plants by 2030 and spend up big on renewable energy and energy storage, arguing it is the best way to keep electricity prices down for consumers while turning a profit. He successfully made the case to enough major shareholders that a demerger would be, in his words, a “terrible outcome for shareholders, communities and the climate”. AGL continues to argue that the demerger was the best way to go, and that most shareholders support it. But the chief executive, Graeme Hunt, and three board members including the chair, Peter Botten, are headed for the exit and the future of the company is in chaos. No alternative path is offered other than a promise of another strategic review and an acknowledgment that “pressure on decarbonisation and energy affordability is accelerating”. You might say. The company says it will also review “any new approaches from third parties” – a nod to the joint takeover bid earlier this year by Cannon-Brookes’s family company Grok Ventures and the Canadian investment giant Brookfield. AGL rejected it twice. Cannon-Brookes is on solid footing when he argues AGL has not provided good value for shareholders. The company’s share price fell 70% over four years before a slight rebound. It dropped 1.7% on Monday. But the turmoil at AGL can’t be divorced from the failures of the federal Coalition on energy policy – namely, its inability to introduce a policy to guide the shift to an inevitable clean power grid, and its attacks on private energy companies that tried to shut coal plants early. Back in 2017, AGL was publicly heavied by the Turnbull government after it announced the early closure of its Liddell coal plant in New South Wales. The Coalition argued long and loud that the company should significantly delay the closure or sell it to another operator that would. AGL’s then chief executive, Andy Vesey, persisted with his plan to replace Liddell with renewable energy and storage, but ended up leaving the company in August 2018. It was later revealed that Josh Frydenberg, then the environment and energy minister, had called AGL board members to suggest they get rid of him. Even after Vesey’s departure, the company stuck with its Liddell plan – the closure has been slightly delayed from this year to 2023 – and a delayed government taskforce report did not back up claims an early shutdown would be a risk to power grid reliability. But there is little doubt AGL’s bruising experience with the government shaped its thinking on coal, including as it launched into the demerger plan. The energy minister in the last parliament, Angus Taylor, continued down a similar path, criticising companies that planned to shut coal plants earlier than the officially listed closure dates. This is not how energy policy should work. It happened as the Coalition rejected the national energy guarantee, the last in a string of policies ditched by a joint party room that was allergic to anything that might look like a climate policy. The reality is coal plants have become increasingly unviable because of the extraordinary rise of solar power. Managing their exit, and the construction of the mix of power sources needed to replace it, is no easy task. But pressuring companies to ignore economic realities while failing to introduce policy is the opposite of a solution. What happens from here is unclear. Electricity prices are increasing, in part because of outages at ageing coal plants on the east coast, but mostly due to coal and gas costs skyrocketing after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. There is a case that this strengthens the argument for a more rapid shift to renewable energy. Cannon-Brookes, as AGL’s largest shareholder, says he wants to meet with the company about its strategic review, and will argue for two seats on the board and a plan to get out of coal and further into renewables that aligns with the Paris climate agreement. It’s early days, but the arrival of a new federal government could help his position. Labor claims its renewable energy policies won’t lead to coal plants shutting earlier than they otherwise would have, but it is more ambitious than the Coalition, and is much less likely to try to stop companies making market-based decisions. The initial lesson for the Albanese government from this is pretty simple: don’t do what the Coalition did. For big polluters, the message is that they will put themselves at risk if they disregard the global drive to deal with fossil fuels quickly. Now would be a good time to work with governments and regulators on a solution consistent with international agreements. Otherwise, you never know when a Cannon-Brookes might be coming for you."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/24/could-angleseys-tidal-energy-project-drive-a-new-energy-revolution","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-24T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"Could Anglesey’s tidal energy project drive a new energy revolution?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/24/could-angleseys-tidal-energy-project-drive-a-new-energy-revolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/apr/24/could-angleseys-tidal-energy-project-drive-a-new-energy-revolution","fields":{"headline":"Could Anglesey’s tidal energy project drive a new energy revolution?","bodyText":"On the stunning and craggy coastline of Holy Island in north Wales, work has started on a construction project to generate energy from one of the world’s greatest untapped energy resources: tidal power. The Morlais project, on the small island off the west of Anglesey has benefited from £31m in what is likely to be the last large grant for Wales from the European Union’s regional funding programme. It will install turbines at what will be one of the largest tidal stream energy sites in the world, covering 13 square miles of the seabed. Gerallt Llewelyn Jones, a director of Morlais Energy, which is operated by Anglesey-based social enterprise Menter Môn, said: “We have strong tidal resources around Wales and they have huge potential.” Compared with wind and solar power, tidal was a more predictable energy source, he added. The project won planning permission from the Welsh government last December and is designed to power more than 180,000 homes once fully operational. Its installation will be phased so that impact on the marine environment can be monitored. The last deep coal mine in Wales, Tower colliery near Aberdare, closed in 2008. Proponents of tidal energy say tide power could drive a new energy revolution in the country, creating thousands of jobs. A range of tidal projects, cost billions of pounds to develop, are now being proposed, and could put Wales at the forefront of a marine energy revolution. The Morlais project is powered by kinetic energy from tidal currents, but the larger-scale projects involve building lagoons with huge sea walls incorporating turbines powered by the rise and fall of tides. The west coast of Britain has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world. One of the most ambitious proposals is the North Wales Tidal Lagoon, with a sea wall of more than 19 miles, from Llandudno to Prestatyn. Its backers say the £7bn project could power more than a million homes and create over 20,000 jobs. Henry Dixon, chairman of North Wales Tidal Energy, which is promoting the proposal, said it would operate with about 120 turbines and it was seeking £50m in funding for the planning process, including impact assessments, engineering and design. He said: “Wales has this huge potential for marine and renewable energy. Wind and nuclear are needed, but we also need tidal. It is eminently cost effective and minister after minister says these schemes are very exciting, but they never get into government policy.” Britain’s most ambitious proposal for a tidal energy project – a £30bn Severn estuary barrage stretching from Somerset to south Wales – was scrapped in 2010. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds opposed the scheme, warning it would devastate the estuary’s bird habitats. Ministers concluded there was “no strategic case” for the project. In 2017, tidal schemes were given a boost with the publication of a review of tidal lagoons by the former energy minister Charles Hendry. He concluded that they could play a cost-effective role in the UK energy mix, helping to deliver security of supply and decarbonisation. “Tidal lagoons can be an important and exciting new industry,” he said. “We are blessed with some of the best resources in the world, which puts us in a unique position to be world leaders.” Hendry recommended a “pathfinder” scheme, but it was never delivered. Proposals for a £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay were rejected in 2018, and tidal power gets only a meagre mention in the government energy strategy published this month. Simon Hamlyn, chief executive of the British Hydropower Association (BHA), said the government had missed a “massive opportunity” by failing to include tidal lagoons, tidal barrages and hydropower as a major element in its new energy strategy. He said: “It’s an incomprehensible omission. I simply cannot understand why the government continues to dismiss hydropower and tidal range – both of which are world-beating technologies and which could power the UK into the future.” Hamlyn said the BHA was supporting a number of potential tidal range projects, including the North Wales Tidal Lagoon and a proposed £590m scheme at the Port of Mostyn in Flintshire, north Wales. There are also proposals for tidal schemes on the West Somerset coast, in Morecambe Bay and on Merseyside. The BHA said the schemes could deliver more than 10% of the UK’s energy needs. Roger Falconer, emeritus professor of water and environmental engineering at Cardiff University, said large tracts of agricultural land in Britain were being covered in solar panels despite the lack of sunshine in winter, but reliable tidal power was not being properly exploited. “The problem with tidal lagoons and barrages is that you don’t get the power until they are virtually completed, and that can take years,” he said. Large-scale schemes offered value for money compared with other energy sources, he added, but the government needed a better funding model for such projects. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “The government absolutely recognises the great potential of tidal power. This is why we have provided the marine energy sector with £175m of innovation and research and development funding, as well as ringfencing a £20m budget for tidal stream energy, for which bids are expected for Welsh projects. “The UK is a global leader in tidal power, to the extent that almost 50% of the world’s installed tidal stream capacity is in UK waters.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/nov/18/how-to-sell-your-strata-on-sustainability-think-of-all-the-things-people-might-object-to","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-17T16:30:43Z","webTitle":"How to convince your apartment strata to go solar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/18/how-to-sell-your-strata-on-sustainability-think-of-all-the-things-people-might-object-to","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/nov/18/how-to-sell-your-strata-on-sustainability-think-of-all-the-things-people-might-object-to","fields":{"headline":"How to convince your apartment strata to go solar","bodyText":"With the federal government dragging its feet on legislating to reduce carbon emissions, many Australians are decreasing their individual carbon footprints, changing their lifestyles and even their homes to become more sustainable. Installing solar panels, solar hot water systems and rain tanks is relatively straightforward on detached houses, but the increasing number of apartment dwellers is posing new challenges for sustainable living. Peter Newman, professor of sustainability at Curtin University, says making apartment buildings sustainable is now “an issue of how, rather than why … It’s something we have to do. It’s no longer a choice.” Individual apartment dwellers could use more energy-efficient appliances and heat-reflecting window films to reduce their environmental footprint, Newman says, but the biggest changes would come from modifying the building to add solar power or insulation. “Both those things need the strata title group to work on it as a shared decision by the whole community rather than just individuals. They are fundamental to being more sustainable and they depend on the group working together.” Newman says the time has come for apartment owners to think of the big picture. “They have to see that their money is being put to use not just for them but … the whole planet.” In Western Australia, a group of unit owners are retrofitting solar panels to their 21-year-old apartment complex and setting up a renewable energy trading system. Owner David Beard, together with fellow owner Henry Christie, has convinced the body corporate to install solar panels on the four-storey building in West Perth. Christie had wanted to install solar for years, but said he put it into the too-hard basket until Beard joined his campaign. Together they looked at power bills for running joint equipment such as lifts and pool pumps and calculated likely solar savings. Beard says that with 14 apartments and two commercial offices in the complex, he had to convince the owners of the benefits: “I think there was a fair degree of ‘We should be doing this to be environmentally friendly’, but the economics still had to stack up.” The owners had a lump sum ready to spend on the project, diverting their reserve fund from a new lift to install 30KW of solar. “We worked out that the savings to individuals and to the strata company itself would help get the reserve fund back up to the amount required by law … it was going to pay for itself within five years,” Beard says. Using a blockchain system developed by energy trading software company Powerledger, the strata receives 10% of the generated power to run common property, while owners are allocated a share of the solar power according to their strata investment, and can trade unused power with each other. Beard says the project took about 12 months to research and set up, despite pandemic-related delays. Now that permission has been granted to switch from individual meters to a single shared meter, the panels should be installed next month. His advice: “Do your homework and think of all the things people might object to … We were fortunate that we had the money in our strata already so there was no initial bill … The fact that we had the money made it painless.” Some councils, including the City of Melbourne and Waverley in Sydney, now offer rebate and incentive schemes to retrofit apartment blocks with solar panels. Researching and learning about schemes that are available in your area could be a good way to kick-start conversations with fellow members of the owners’ corporation. However, the path to a more sustainable apartment complex is not always straightforward. Mark Skrzypek has been trying for years to create a rooftop garden for his small apartment complex in Melbourne’s South Yarra neighbourhood. He says the green roof was the final flourish in a campaign to make the complex more community minded and environmentally friendly. “We’d done everything we could. We’d redone the gardens. We’d made them more communal and enticing. We put in a worm farm out the back … We ran workshops and taught everyone how to use them.” Skrzypek’s three-storey, art deco, double-brick apartment building has 12 units and a sensational river view from the unused roof. Over the past six years he has worked with several other owners to research how to add a green roof, and convince every owner to go ahead with the project. The process has been complicated. “It’s all those things about weight and weight bearing: the weight of soil and the types of plants that will survive,” Skrzypek says. “We have mirrored walls from neighbouring buildings and it’s astronomically hot up here.” Inspired by a similar project at 38 Westbury Street in East St Kilda, Skrzypek conceived of the South Yarra project as a true green roof, with grass and plantings to reduce the heat-island effect. He says the engineering involved meant the project was not cheap. “It’s a hell of a lot of money – in excess of $100,000 – and we’re aware that we’re playing with other people’s money so you want it to be right and you want it to be a success … There were lots of meetings, lots of talk over several AGMs about what it would mean to their tenants and their investment.” With owners reluctant to raise a levy, Skrzypek says they made a long-term plan to save the funds. However, pandemic lockdowns and inflated building costs have added complications. “Particularly with the second lockdown, prices went through the roof. I think it went up by 30%. We realised we no longer had the money to do it.” Instead, the original concept has been traded for shared garden boxes, but even that has been complicated. “No one is an expert in the field so we found it fraught with surprises,” Skrzypek says. Lockdown delays allowing, he is hoping for a garden by Christmas. Despite all the hurdles, he says he would do it again. “We all want to be more connected with nature … I think this is the way forward for cities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/apr/01/best-uk-music-festivals-still-available-to-book-2023","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-01T10:55:49Z","webTitle":"Give it some welly: the 30 best UK music festivals still available to book","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/01/best-uk-music-festivals-still-available-to-book-2023","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/apr/01/best-uk-music-festivals-still-available-to-book-2023","fields":{"headline":"Give it some welly: the 30 best UK music festivals still available to book","bodyText":"Best for big names Download 8 to 11 June, Leicestershire For its 20th edition, the biggest name in metal fests is getting going a day early on the Thursday, giving Metallica the chance to headline twice (with completely different sets) over the same weekend. Friday night sees Bring Me the Horizon make the step they’ve been preparing for since getting a major-label deal, but the draw of Download has always been its total immersion in metal, not just the headliners. Michael Hann TRNSMT 7 to 9 July, Glasgow Fellas from across the generations head up Glasgow’s TRNSMT, with Pulp taking up the elder statesmen position while the 1975 and Sam Fender will be doing their bit for the Gen Z crowd. Blokey headliners aside (Pulp’s Candida Doyle, we thank you for your service), there’s fun of all pop-adjacent varieties from Dream Wife, Ashnikko, the Big Moon and Becky Hill, while girl group of the moment Flo face their biggest test to date: seeing how their zingy sound translates to the festival stage. Leonie Cooper Wireless 7 to 9 July, London Back to a singular weekend in north London’s Finsbury Park for 2023, Wireless is still the UK’s go-to destination for hip-hop and R&amp;B. This year, it has pulled out four UK festival exclusives: headliners Playboi Carti, Travis Scott, D-Block Europe and 50 Cent won’t be performing anywhere else, offering solid bang for your TikTok-streaming buck. Another big draw is the improved presence of women on the lineup; Glorilla, Flo and Ice Spice are unlikely to be playing in such early festival slots for long. Jenessa Williams Latitude 20 to 23 July, Suffolk Not only does Latitude feature ruddy-cheeked Radio 2 fave George Ezra, brooding Scottish troubadour Paolo Nutini and returning Britpop dandies Pulp as its musical headliners, it has also gathered together some top-notch comedy in the shape of Ed Gamble, Bridget Christie, Sara Pascoe and Romesh Ranganathan. If you’re feeling a bit squiffy on the Sunday there is also an afternoon orchestral performance to look forward to from Manchester greats James. Michael Cragg Reading &amp; Leeds 25 to 27 August, Reading and Leeds With both sites now featuring two main stages – billed as east and west – this messy, summer bank holiday, pre-university blowout has even more space for music’s big guns. While – deep breath – the Killers, Lewis Capaldi, Billie Eilish, Imagine Dragons, Sam Fender and Foals sit at the top of the bill in the biggest fonts, they’re ably supported by a clutch of next-gen headliners such as Wet Leg and Rina Sawayama. MC *** Best for family fun Bearded Theory 25 to 28 May, Derbyshire Proudly independent and with absolutely no sponsorship or branding anywhere on site – for one weekend you shall be free from the tyranny of Oatly/Red Bull/insert other overbearing marketing campaigns – Bearded Theory offers a true getaway from modern capitalism. Sure, preteens may shrug with indifference at headliners Interpol, Primal Scream and the Pretenders, but they’ll be endlessly entertained by the Children’s Village, which includes a “festival school” that’s previously hosted such delights as PE classes from Derby County FC. LC Camp Bestival 27 to 30 July, Dorset; 17 to 20 August, Shropshire Not so much a festival as a family entertainment bazaar for campers, Camp Bestival pioneered the concept of the festival at which Dick and Dom are as important to the lineup as this year’s Dorset headliner, Grace Jones. For the grownups, expect a bit of nostalgia, some cool current stuff, and – for Shropshire attenders only – the extreme grindcore stylings of Napalm Death. MH Deer Shed 28 to 31 July, North Yorkshire Nestled in the Yorkshire Dales, Deer Shed has quietly grown into one of the UK’s most smartly curated and best-value summer events. Headliners the Comet Is Coming, Public Service Broadcasting and the Delgados will entertain the hipster parents, but Deer Shed really comes into its own with its fancy dress themes, family-friendly workshops and sports activities, ranging from sock wrestling and kayaking to AI-themed album artwork creation. Kids under two go free, and an under-15s weekend ticket is a reasonable £77. JW Stowaway festival 18 to 20 August, Buckinghamshire Adults seem almost like an afterthought at Buckinghamshire’s relentlessly active Stowaway, which couldn’t be any more appealing to kids if it had an indoor soft play centre hosted by Peppa Pig. The majestic Kid’s Kingdom boasts a roller disco, tree climbing, a vintage funfair, paddleboarding, circus workshops and a host of hyperactive entertainers in glitter and faux fur who’ll take your children off your hands while you snooze away to funk and soul great Roy Ayers’ farewell tour set. LC The Big Feastival 25 to 27 August, Oxfordshire You want bucolic? The Big Feastival will throw bucolic at you (it lists its location as: “Alex James’s farm, the Cotswolds”). Here – as the name suggests – the chefs fight it out with the bands and the kids’ entertainers for top billing. Not one for the real ale enthusiast with a penchant for post-rock, but very much the event for those with the desire for music to be the setting rather than the purpose for their weekend. And maybe you’ll get to meet Jeremy Clarkson! MH *** Best for going hard Parklife 10 &amp; 11 June, Manchester For those who thrive off the buzz of a packed crowd, Parklife offers a rammed roster of dance, alt-pop and mainstream-adjacent curios. Hometown heroes the 1975 will headline on the Sunday, but huge crowds are also anticipated for Fred Again, Slowthai, Eliza Rose and Skrillex, topped off by a vibrant roster of DJs late into the night. Just remember to get that taxi booked in advance: it’s a long walk back into town on worn-out dancer’s feet if you can’t squeeze on the tram. JW Tramlines 21 to 23 July, Sheffield Although its origins as a free, community-focused event are in the past, Tramlines retains a strong northern identity (this year’s headliners are Richard Ashcroft, the Courteeners and Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott). It’s an expertly judged mix of the very familiar and the just-unusual-enough to mean both the daytime radio listeners and music snobs will find something to interest them. MH Wilderness 3 to 6 August, Oxfordshire Billed as “a weekend of escapism, high jinks and wholesome hedonism”, this dance-leaning festival nestled in a big park in Oxfordshire is ripe for forgetting all about real life. You can dance like no one’s watching to headliners the Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim, submit yourself to Christine and the Queens’ delicious art-pop, or party like it’s 2002 to the re-formed Sugababes. There’s even a wellbeing area for when you need to come back down to earth. MC We Out Here 10 to 14 August, Dorset DJ and broadcaster Gilles Peterson’s We Out Here festival has grown at a rapid pace. While its debut edition in 2019 played as a small-scale celebration of the UK jazz scene and its intersections with club culture, 2023’s event boasts an expanded new site in Dorset and international names across genres. It is a weekend for the jazz technicians and all-night ravers alike, featuring performances from spiritual jazz pioneers Sun Ra Arkestra and Paris-via-Chicago drummer Makaya McCraven, as well as fast-paced DJ sets from LTJ Bukem, Goldie and Roni Size. Ammar Kalia All Points East 18, 19, 25 &amp; 28 August, London City day festivals always feel ripe for big blowouts: you’ve got more energy, you’re not preoccupied by the threat of your tent washing away, and smaller sites make it easier to link up with pals. All Points East, which is split over two weekends, features a typically exuberant crowd descending oneast London’s Victoria Park, and is this year headlined by indie-disco favourites the Strokes, the impeccably choreographed Haim, and fast-becoming-headline-veteran Stormzy. MC *** Best boutique festivals HowTheLightGetsIn 26 to 29 May, Hay-on-Wye Described as a “philosophy and music festival”, HowTheLightGetsIn makes confident use of onstage debate, scientific lectures and breakfast roundtables to present an alternative take on festival collectivism, positioning intimate, open-minded conversation as a social good. At the end of a long day’s thinking, you can throw some shapes to the likes of Gruff Rhys and Anna Meredith, or embrace the luxury of a four-course sundown banquet alongside the River Wye. It certainly beats bickering with strangers over Twitter … JW Kite festival 9 to 11 June, Oxfordshire If Joan Collins, Candi Staton and David Baddiel sound like an imaginative answer to the eternal “ideal dinner party guest” question, look no further than Oxfordshire’s Kite. Equal parts music festival and literary event, this year’s lineup boasts interesting book-oriented conversation salons, as well as performances from young and innovative artists. From the art-pop drag subversion of Lynks to the hip-hop/jazz fusion of Ezra Collective, you are almost guaranteed to discover a new-to-you artist with something to say – and there are more familiar attractions in the shape of Suede, Hot Chip and the Pretenders. JW Lost Village 24 to 27 August, Lincolnshire One for the early birds, the ultra-immersive Lost Village is all about daytime fun. There’s no need to wait until sundown to become your most feral self in this atmospheric Lincolnshire woodland, with activities kicking off at 9am every day. The Blessed Madonna, Horse Meat Disco and Jayda G are on DJ duties, but it’s perfectly acceptable to eat and laugh your way around the intimate site too, with big-name comedians and fancy banquets as well as creative workshops and intriguing talks. LC Krankenhaus 25 to 27 August, Cumbria At the time of writing, the lineup for the third edition of Sea Power’s festival has not been announced, but expect it – like its curators – to be an agreeably eccentric mix of styles, made by beloved outliers. But you don’t go to Krankenhaus for who is playing so much as for where it is (at the edge of the Lake District, next to the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway) and what it is (the only festival with daily heron feeding). MH End of the Road 31 August to 3 September, Dorset End of the Road consistently manages the delicate balancing act of keeping its audience capped at only 15,000 revellers to ensure that its idyllic site stays clean and spacious, while also booking fairly major names such as King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard and Future Islands. The headliners skew towards the guitar-oriented, but early showings by upcoming acts (such as Jockstrap in 2019), to a range of comedy and literary talks. AK *** Best specialist events Cheltenham jazz festival 26 April to 1 May, Cheltenham Smart, sophisticated and civilised, Cheltenham’s jazz festival is a far cry from the muddy fields of most British weekenders. With gigs taking place in small venues throughout the town, as well as in a tented campus in the city centre, Cheltenham is a playground for jazz veterans as well as newcomers, featuring performances this year from singer Gregory Porter and bassist Stanley Clarke. For a more unbuttoned feel, the jam at the Hotel du Vin carries on into the early hours. AK Black Deer 16 to 18 June, Kent If you think the garden of England is a strange place to enjoy the twanging sounds of Americana, you’d be right. But Black Deer isn’t going to let the cruelty of geography stop it from throwing one of the most fabulously curated hoedowns of the summer. Alongside the venerable Bonnie Raitt and Lucinda Williams, you will find groundbreaking folk newcomers Allison Russell and Willi Carlisle. Don’t miss the Roadhouse area, a full-throttle tribute to leathered-up Easy Rider counterculture where your best Patrick Swayze impersonations are encouraged. LC Love Supreme 30 June to 2 July, East Sussex If Cheltenham occupies the concert hall end of the jazz festival spectrum, Love Supreme is its faster and looser opposite. Touted as Europe’s largest outdoor jazz festival, Love Supreme is the full fields-and-camping experience, replete with a lineup that combines improvising greats with crowd-drawing funk, soul and rap stars. The 2023 edition features Mercury prize winner Little Simz and Grace Jones alongside Ethio-jazz pioneer Mulatu Astatke, drummer Yussef Dayes and the British saxophonist Courtney Pine. AK Womad 27 to 30 July, Wiltshire Whether you call it global music, “the world’s music”, or something else entirely, Womad has been championing music from non-western traditions since 1980. It has been home to formative performances from the likes of Sufi singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the Royal Drummers of Burundi and sitar player Ravi Shankar, while this year’s lineup features the son of Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti, Femi, along with reggae singer Horace Andy. It’s the most diverse festival selection you’re likely to find. AK Rebellion festival 3 to 6 August, Blackpool Expect to see PUNX NOT DEAD spray-painted on the back of leather jackets at Blackpool’s annual indoor jamboree of all things spiky-haired. Much of the bill would be present and correct were it to be magically transported back 40 years (the Damned, the Exploited, UK Subs, Ruts DC). But there are newer stars (Bob Vylan, Chubby and the Gang, the Chisel) and US hardcore greats (Descendents, DRI, Gang Green) as well. MH *** Best for epic scenery Timber festival 7 to 9 July, Derbyshire If you’re worried that Timber sounds a bit wooden, don’t be: that’s the whole point. Taking place in Feanedock – the UK’s first new forest in 1,000 years – this festival celebrates all things green. The bill is unsurprisingly folksy, with bat walks, falconry displays and a woodland hot sauna and ice plunge-pool on offer, not to mention readings from the poet laureate Simon Armitage and author-walker Raynor Winn, and a set from Bristol’s sublime singer-songwriter Lady Nade. LC Doune the Rabbit Hole 21 to 23 July, Stirlingshire Nestled among the ancient oak trees of the Cardross Estate, this intimate independent Scottish festival boasts consistently impressive lineups (this year’s is TBC) and demands you clear storage space on your phone for all the incoming photos. As well as those cosmically lit giant oaks, there are rolling hills, ancient buildings and mini circus tops featuring impromptu drum circles. The kids’ designated Play Zone even features a fairy garden. MC Belladrum Tartan Heart 27 to 29 July, Inverness Set in the Italian gardens of the Belladrum Estate near Inverness, the family-friendly Belladrum Tartan Heart festival is a boutique weekender with a taste for pop-leaning headliners and homegrown talent to accompany its rolling green scenery. Since 2004, Scottish stars such as Franz Ferdinand, Chvrches and Texas have all topped the bill, while this year’s edition sees 2012 headliners Travis return, along with Norwegian pop star Sigrid and Eurovision runner-up Sam Ryder. AK Kendal Calling 27 to 30 July, Cumbria Imagine an episode of Countryfile soundtracked by a jolting mix of Magic and XFM and you’ve got Kendal Calling. Housed in the beautiful, evergreen Lowther Deer Park in the Lake District, it’s a festival that mirrors its breathtaking surroundings in its stage design. So there’s the cascading foliage of Parklands, the neon psychedelia of Lowlands and the rustic feel of Woodlands, which ring to the sounds of everyone from Kasabian to Rick Astley via Natalia Imbruglia and Blossoms. MC Boardmasters 9 to 13 August, Cornwall One of the few fests in the world that can claim a surfing competition as one of its biggest draws, Boardmasters makes excellent use of its Cornish coast location, complementing the scenery with an array of feelgood musical bookings. Friday headliner Lorde feels like an especially inspired fit given the beachy escapism of her most recent album Solar Power, but Liam Gallagher, Florence + the Machine, Little Simz and Ben Howard all feel like equally good gets for easing into the final few weeks of summer.

Boris Johnson is planning to unveil a radical new “energy strategy” within a fortnight to ensure the UK can meet its domestic needs from a mix of renewables and nuclear. The war in Ukraine has brought further huge rises in global fossil fuel prices and exposed countries’ dependence on overseas supplies. Remarkably, the need for more on- and offshore windfarms – traditionally a highly controversial subject in the Conservative party – is now being talked about within government as a matter of security, rather than a way of fighting climate change. Renewables such as wind and solar power are expected to be part of the new government strategy to free Britain from dependence on imported oil and gas and spare households and businesses from the effects of wild fluctuations on global energy markets. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, said last week on Twitter: “This is no longer about tackling climate change or reaching net-zero targets. Ensuring the UK’s clean energy independence is a matter of national security. Putin can set the price of gas, but he can’t directly control the price of renewables and nuclear we generate in the UK.” Official figures show that meeting net-zero targets would lead to a drop in gas use of 65% by 2035 in the UK, and almost 100% by 2050. While some Tory MPs also want the moratorium on fracking for shale gas to be lifted to help reduce dependence on imports, cabinet sources said there was no realistic prospect of doing so in the short term, until the process had been proved to be demonstrably safe. Instead a majority of cabinet ministers back a big push for more renewables and an expansion of nuclear. Johnson said last week that all oil imports from Russia would be phased out by the end of this year. In the UK, 4% of gas and 8% of oil currently comes from Russia. The EU sources about 40% of its gas from Russia and 27% of its oil. Sources said changes to planning rules that would make it easier to build windfarms are likely to be announced as part of the new energy strategy. Construction has tailed off since David Cameron tightened regulations when he was prime minister: at the moment local residents can easily block such plans. It is also understood that the government may ease the way for more offshore wind farms, in the teeth of opposition from the fishing industry. Other countries are also using security issues raised by the Ukraine crisis to push urgently for more green and clean energy. Germany’s government announced last week an additional €30bn for its clean energy transition in response to the invasion. Christian Lindner, the finance minister, described renewables as “freedom energies” that could allow Germany a greater degree of energy independence and transform “the economy, society and the state”. Labour has called for an urgent “national sprint” to build a clean, green, secure energy future including more renewables. Ed Miliband, shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, said last week: “Energy security is national security. Homegrown, clean power is the cheaper, more secure route to energy security and sovereignty.” In 2020 renewables generated 43 per cent of Britain’s electricity while gas, oil and coal contributed about 40 per cent. The remaining capacity was filled by nuclear. In October last year Johnson announced that all of Britain’s electricity will come from clean energy sources by 2035. The plan now is to bring that date forward. While many Conservative MPs and party members have opposed windfarms, there are signs of growing support. Kevin Hollinrake, Tory MP for Thirsk and Malton, said: “England’s planning system has blocked nearly all new onshore wind developments in the past five years, despite this being the cheapest source of new electricity generation. Reforming these rules, while ensuring communities still get a meaningful say, will spur investment in homegrown clean energy and accelerate our transition away from expensive fossil fuels.” Sam Hall, director of the Conservative Environment Network, an independent forum for Tories who back decarbonisation, commented: “Streamlining planning approvals and regulations would unleash more wind and solar projects to provide cheap, clean, homegrown power. Now is the time to accelerate the drive towards net zero and away from volatile fossil fuels.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/feb/22/donald-trump-new-social-media-app-truth-social","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-22T15:10:46Z","webTitle":"Fake news alert!

Donald Trump’s new social media app is a triumph","bodyText":"Truth hurts, everyone knows that. Nevertheless, I wasn’t expecting my experience with Truth Social, Donald Trump’s new social media venture, to be quite so painful. After months of fanfare, the former president’s new app, which is essentially a Twitter clone, was opened to the US public on Sunday night. Obviously, I signed up straight away – or at least I tried to. I spent 20 frustrating minutes attempting to create a new account and getting error message after error message. Eventually, I managed to sign up with the username @stormyd, only to be told that I had been put on a waiting list “due to massive demand”. I was number 194,276 in line, apparently. Which, I’m sure, is a very precise number and not something they just pulled out of the air. It is unclear how many people were actually successful at getting on Truth Social – although the Guardian has reported that at least one Catholic priest managed to join. The fact that you, apparently, needed God on your side to secure an account wasn’t the only issue with the launch: the app has also run into potential legal trouble. It turns out Truth Social may not have just taken inspiration from Twitter, the app’s logo looks suspiciously like that of a British solar power startup called Trailar. “Great to see Donald Trump supporting a growing sustainability business!” Trailar tweeted on Monday. “Maybe ask next time?” If Trump’s new app failed to successfully launch on time, it would hardly be the surprise of the century. The last time he made a lot of noise about launching a new media platform, it turned out to be an underwhelming blog, which shuttered after just a few weeks. It’s not as if Trump put a technological genius in charge of Truth Social: Devin Nunes, head honcho at the app’s parent company, Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG), may be most famous for the fact that he once unsuccessfully sued a cow. In 2019, Nunes, who used to be a Republican congressman, filed a $250m lawsuit against Twitter and two parody Twitter accounts: one was called “Devin Nunes’ Mom” and one was called “Devin Nunes’ Cow”. This is no laughing matter, I’ll have you know. The cow was very mean to him: it called the politician a “treasonous cowpoke” whose “boots are full of manure”. It was all very hard for the poor man, whose lawsuit claimed that the parody accounts subjected him to a “defamation campaign of stunning breadth and scope, one that no human being should ever have to bear and suffer in their whole life”. Nunes doesn’t just have beef with cows, by the way. He’s a big fan of suing anyone who says anything mean to him, and has launched defamation lawsuits against a number of journalists. He managed to juggle all these lawsuits with his political career for a while but, in December, announced he was leaving Congress to join TMTG. “The time has come to reopen the internet and allow for the free flow of ideas and expression without censorship,” he proclaimed. Unless cows are involved, obviously. No free speech or free flow of ideas for cows! Or pesky journalists. Or anyone who says anything unflattering, if we’re being honest. Truth Social’s marketing material talks about welcoming diverse opinions but the app’s terms and conditions are rather more restrictive. Under “prohibited activities”, the rules state that users of the site agree not to “disparage, tarnish, or otherwise harm, in our opinion, us and/or the Site”. A cynic might wonder whether the fact that you are not allowed to say mean things about Trump on his app may factor in why Melania doesn’t appear to be a big fan of her husband’s latest venture. A couple of weeks ago, you see, the former first lady entered into a “special arrangement” to share “exclusive communications” with the conservative social media app Parler. Why would she announce an exclusive relationship with a direct competitor to Truth Social shortly before it launched ? I’m not even going to begin to speculate. The truth is out there, but there’s a very long waiting list to get to it.

I’m a pop star’","bodyText":"Lorde, in case it wasn’t obvious, has made her name on glorification. Ella Yelich-O’Connor was an aristocracy-obsessed 16-year-old when her imperiously cool debut album, 2013’s Pure Heroine, elevated suburban New Zealand adolescence to pop echelons in which those kids had never previously seen themselves. In 2017, Melodrama cast post-breakup hedonism in glittering synths, dramatising one fabulous night on the cusp of adulthood as if it were Greek tragedy. Her forthcoming third album, Solar Power, has humbler origins, especially for a songwriter who likes describing inspiration as “divine”. The loose, sunny instrumentation – inspired as much by Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash as Nelly Furtado – mirrors a shift within the 24-year-old. “When I got my dog, all of a sudden you’re literally picking up shit, cleaning up vomit and not caring,” she says cheerfully, video-calling from the start of a jet-lag-addled workday in Los Angeles. Her elegant jewellery and sleeveless black top contrast with her gusto for animal bodily functions. “It’s all in service of this huge amount of love. You feel this shift toward the feral and a relinquishing of the control that would have maybe kept that feral nature at bay.” She loved it. “Because I’ve been the master of my own universe since, like, 16. Which is a very unusual experience.” More on the dog – the dearly departed Pearl – later. These may seem insalubrious beginnings for one of the year’s most anticipated albums, but if Solar Power glorifies anything, it is life’s natural rhythms: tides, seasons, the evolution of a feeling, or indeed, canine cogitation. Lorde wanted to reflect how she feels at home in Auckland, where she lives in blissful obscurity. There are hardly any paparazzi; once in a blue moon she pops up on MailOnline, buying a rug. In 2018 she deleted all but a few posts from her Instagram and Twitter and abandoned both. Her greatest joy is contemplating the promise of a long summer day: will she garden? Swim? Fish? She rues spending today’s solstice trapped on Zoom; at home, she would have swum at dawn. The album’s genesis, she says, “was this feeling of the clothes coming off and the skin being exposed and feeling this playfulness”. Behold the artwork, in which she leaps over the camera, revealing an acute bikini wedgie. “When I first saw it I was like, ooh!” she gasps coyly, raising a dainty hand to her mouth. But it worked. “It felt innocent and free, a little feral, a little spicy.” The simple life dissolved a little self-seriousness. “Making my first record, I would have rather died than have an acoustic guitar,” she says. “Acoustic guitars were like, bonfires and guys in dumb hats, it was very mid-2000s to me.” She belly-laughs. “And then everything I listened to became guitar music by way of both 2004 and 1976!” She was too young to enjoy the “bright, forward, shimmery acoustics” of Natalie Imbruglia, Natasha Bedingfield and All Saints first time around. Delving back, she heard “a time of optimism” in this critically maligned era. “‘Take me to my beach’, ‘If you’re fond of sand dunes and salty air’ – all these crunchy outdoor images were so compelling to me, and felt so ripe for a return.” (I hear the Spice Girls’ Viva Forever in it, and am mortified to learn she has never heard it. I send it to her later, and it hits the spot. “Gonna spend some time with this.”) She told her drummer Matt Chamberlain to make his parts “sound like skateboarding”, a sense memory she wanted to channel. She can’t skate, although her teenage friends could. “I always remember seeing that light come up from the bowl and it being so blue, it’s a very visceral memory.” This newfound ease does not, however, portend a crusty campfire singalong. She and co-producer Jack Antonoff “still pored over every fucking detail! I’m a maniac, my ears are unparalleled. You can’t get a thing past me.” Solar Power’s title track and lead single draws on the transformative pleasures of the beach, referencing the buoyant daze of Primal Scream’s Loaded and George Michael’s Freedom 90. (Bobby Gillespie and Michael’s estate gave it their blessing.) It doesn’t reach for the wayward euphoria of Melodrama’s lead single Green Light, but more attainable epiphanies. Some critics called it slight. “I don’t think of Solar Power as a shallow moment,” says Lorde. “It’s still very much a moment of depth and it feels very big to me, it’s just also light and flirty.” Melodrama was one of the most critically acclaimed albums of 2017. Lorde still considers it a miracle it got made – she and Antonoff, both “young and clueless”, were left alone for two years. “We had taste and feelings but we didn’t really know how to make anything.” Yet it failed to replicate Pure Heroine’s commercial highs. She didn’t seem to care. (In 2018, she said: “If you’re here for the commercial performance of my work you’ll only become more and more disenchanted.”) Nonetheless, her influence has never been louder: the likes of Olivia Rodrigo, Conan Gray and Holly Humberstone have appropriated Lorde’s instantly identifiable sprite-like vocal harmonies. She hasn’t noticed – she doesn’t listen to much contemporary pop – although she’s flattered. “It’s my joy to be patient zero on a harmony virus.” I have heard half of Solar Power. Unless there are massive pop songs hidden elsewhere, it is much more intimate than its tumultuous predecessor, centring those trademark vocals in classic pop melodies that summon the Carpenters’ uneasy beauty. While Lorde still thinks of herself “absolutely” as a pop artist, she is “way past being interested in if it’s going to play on the radio or anywhere in a literal pop context. It’ll be interesting to see if this becomes a sound people are interested in because it’s so fucking zany.” She calls Solar Power joyful and optimistic, but I am struck by its sadness: the laments on celebrity, the climate crisis, wellness culture and time passing; the weighty self-doubt. “I didn’t think it was that sad,” Lorde says, surprised and inquisitive. She cites the prismatic folk song Stoned at the Nail Salon. “That kind of searching, being unsure that I had chosen the right path and feeling lonely, I don’t see those as permanent or even bad emotions. It’s all part of the thing” – life – “to feel that trepidation. Maybe it is sad, but I’m very comfortable in the periods of limbo, or times where I feel afraid or vulnerable.” Also on that song, she sings of how “all the beautiful girls will fade like the roses”. That relatively recent revelation was “truly the first time that I had entertained the notion that the sexy models on Instagram who made me feel inferior – they too will age”. She shrugs happily. “We’re all on the same bus. At some point we have to get on the bus back.” Contemplating time passing was comforting, she says. “I was old enough to finally think about it. When you’re a kid, you’re immortal.” She says the record is definitively a product of joy, albeit joy born from the revelations of grief. Which brings us back to Pearl. In 2018, exhausted from touring and craving stability, Lorde decided to get a dog. “And he would have gold hair, and that would take me somewhere,” she says. “And he did. He was the ultimate tour guide.” He lay under the piano while she learned to write on an instrument for the first time. “To feel this energy that was not being generated by me was really profound,” she says. Caring for him helped her understand her parents and contemplate her own future children, to consider things “that are greater than my feelings on this dancefloor”, she says, with self-deprecation. “I could have the worst workday ever, but you come home and this being is pleased to see you. You’ve done that right for another day, you know? There was an element of wanting to take my performance scores away from ‘How’s this review?’ I’m not so that way inclined now, but maybe at the time I was a little more.” After less than two years together, Pearl succumbed to lifelong health issues. Lorde emailed fans to say the loss would delay her new record; the grief was long-lasting. She hasn’t returned to the park where they walked. Without wishing to diminish his life, the scale of her devastation seemed to represent some greater loss. “It was absolutely, you’re right, something bigger,” she says. “It was everything. But I don’t know how much of this I wanna talk about with a journalist.” She chuckles kindly and tries to trace its outline. “Grief is a really transformative force. I’d never experienced it fully like that, and it makes you question everything. It overturns a lot.” How it has changed her is probably a detail for the next album. “This record is about how precious life is, really,” she says. She got a sense of it when she fulfilled a lifelong dream to visit Antarctica in February 2019. “The only thing to contemplate there is this raw force,” she says. “It’s as much terror as beauty. You don’t feel welcomed by the natural world – I completely felt like an interloper.” She calls it a spiritual pilgrimage. “It was the middle of summer in New Zealand. Going from the beach and tans to this hostile, cold environment and back to the beach, that whiplash helped set the scene to start writing this record.” Addressing the natural world on the album “was kind of a grieving process as well as a celebratory one”, she says. Fans are convinced that the video to Solar Power, in which Lorde skips around a rudimentary beach civilisation populated by bored acolytes, is a political comment. Dressed in yellow, she must represent the sun duping braindead kids into ignoring climate warning signs! Or callous politicians ignoring the issue while everyone suffers! The beach will appear in more videos and “reveal its mysteries”, she teases, but the album is not “my big climate change record”. “I’m not a climate activist, I’m a pop star. I stoke the fire of a giant machine, spitting out emissions as I go. There is a lot I don’t know.” A much-analysed moment from the Solar Power video, in which she hustles the camera past some rubbish, is her “winking at the huge amount of idealism that people direct at where I’m from”, she says. “We have our literal and metaphorical trash on the beach like everyone else.” She won’t be drawn on Jacinda Ardern, a focus of global adulation but a source of frustration for young New Zealanders, who consider her risk-averse. “We’ve got a lot of shit we need to work on.” She wanted to disabuse anyone of the idea that she had any answers. The album opener, The Path, is set at the 2016 Met Gala, where Lorde steals a fork for her mum, observes “supermodels dancing around a pharaoh’s tomb”, then admits: “If you’re looking for a saviour, well that’s not me.” She says it’s an odd place to start, “but I know enough about how people view me – we’re taught to view famous people as gods now – and I just wanted to dismantle that”. One song, Fallen Fruit, is a crushed flower-power lament for the spoiled Eden her generation inherited. But that’s the only protest song. She recalls Mark Rylance saying that artists should tell love stories about the climate. “The opposite has been proven not to work,” she says. “I do think these songs are love stories more than anything. But love is complicated.” The lost flower-children in the Solar Power video and the sad girls in the album’s lyrics mollifying emptiness with weed, manicures and crystals chime with the quote in Lorde’s Instagram bio from Joan Didion’s 1967 essay Slouching Towards Bethlehem, about dropouts and psychedelics in Haight-Ashbury. In isolation, “a return to innocence – the mysteries of the blood – an itch for the transcendental” looks like a statement of artistic intent. In context, it comes from a psychiatrist assessing how romantic movements formed in times of crisis always end in authoritarianism. Is she suggesting darker times still to come for a generation who have reached for alternatives in the absence of traditional support structures? She’s wary of revealing too much, but “that’s the vibe”, she says coyly. “I read a lot about the dropping-out movement and commune life, the ideological crises people were having then, and felt a lot of parallels with what people are going through now. It’s all gonna become clear later, but it was such a fun, rich zone to be mining.” Lorde spent most of the pandemic in New Zealand, which was minimally impacted by Covid. “I don’t feel like I’m that tapped into the greater cultural consciousness around it,” she confesses. She has never felt better. “I think it’s getting offline, but I really feel like I’m only just now scratching the surface of my powers, which is a very exciting feeling.” She quit social media and turned her phone into a “dumbphone” – she shows me the greyscale display, believed to minimise compulsive checking – after she came across the author Annie Dillard’s aphorism: “How we spend our days is how we spend our lives.” She repeats it emphatically. “I was like, I can’t do this for ever, this can’t be it.” Social media was fun for years. “But I think it was altering my neural pathways and homogenising my trains of thought. I was losing touch with my ability to explore an idea at my own pace, which felt like losing my free will at times.” She laughs, baffled. “I was very addicted. To be able to put that aside has put me into such a position of power and fertility and creativity and confidence.” Over email, I ask if she worries about losing touch, especially making work that touches on generational predicaments. “I actually think falling out of touch is one of the better things, emotionally and creatively, to happen to me in my 20s,” she replies. “I’m aware it’s absolutely a social and economic privilege to do so. I really think people need me to be able to see our world clearly in order to write about it, and I couldn’t do that and remain online.” The work, she says, “can be as rich and personal as it is” because of those boundaries. She was inspired to get offline after reading the artist Jenny Odell’s How to Do Nothing, a polemic on resisting productivity. She hopes Solar Power will do for fans “what that book did for me, which was to retrain my attention. It was literally walking my dog – 45 minutes twice a day at the local park – and that was so big and transcendent for me.” When Lorde emerged, articulate teenage pop stars who wrote their own songs were few and far between. Now there are dozens in her wake, from Rodrigo to Billie Eilish. Her own precocity has shapeshifted, evident in how she has enforced normality on her life. “I was just at home for years,” she says of Solar Power’s roots. “It would make me feel vulnerable sometimes, feeling that cut off and that irrelevant, so to speak. But it’s also very powerful, and I can understand that as something that is precious.” Solar Power is out on 20 August"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/23/labor-now-has-the-chance-to-act-with-gusto-on-climate-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T03:49:14Z","webTitle":"Labor now has the chance to act with gusto on climate policy | Frank Jotzo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/23/labor-now-has-the-chance-to-act-with-gusto-on-climate-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/23/labor-now-has-the-chance-to-act-with-gusto-on-climate-policy","fields":{"headline":"Labor now has the chance to act with gusto on climate policy","bodyText":"This election marks a new start for climate policy in Australia. The Albanese government has the chance to do more than to make a start on selected policy measures: it can redefine the national conversation about climate change. The central issue for Anthony Albanese and his government is social justice, not climate change. Cost-of-living pressures loom large, and the sharper focus on international security saps attention. But good climate policy can help with all of these. In any case the government must meet voter expectations on climate change going into the next election. Next time it could be Labor that loses seats to climate-friendly independents and Greens. And in this parliament, the Senate will push Labor to do more on climate. Pressure to do more will be even stronger if it ends up a minority government. The big opportunity is to see climate policy as part of the big quest for future opportunities for the younger generation. A far more ambitious climate policy agenda than what Labor took to the election would naturally follow. Climate change action is often seen as a trade-off between environment and economy. In reality, many investments that will cut emissions will pay for themselves over time. Energy bills can fall as a result of more low-cost renewable power or better energy efficiency. Decarbonising will help Australia stay competitive in global markets. Most measures that cut emissions have other benefits like cleaner air and greater energy security. It is about investing heavily over this decade and the next, in order to reap the benefits for a very long time to come. Chris Bowen and Jim Chalmers, as climate change minister and treasurer respectively, could carry a sustained agenda of strong climate action as an investment in the country’s economic future. Penny Wong as foreign minister could reinforce it internationally. It would be a legacy for the ages. Such a reframing would need a real national conversation about Australia’s future in a world that acts on climate change. What are the different pathways to make net zero emissions a reality? Where are the economic and business opportunities, what does it mean for trade and tax revenue, what are the social pressure points, what will be the effects in different regions, and how will we manage all this in a way that spreads both the benefits and the costs? The new government, or the Climate Change Authority on its behalf, could convene an inclusive and exhaustive process towards a national long-term climate strategy. If it is a true dialogue among all major groups in society, supported by the best available information, it will unveil a wealth of opportunity and ways to bridge the gaps. And focusing on agreement on goals and broad lines will make subsequent policy implementation politically easier. In practical terms, what can be done or started soon? Australia’s 2030 emissions target will be increased, sending an important signal internationally and to investors. But the proposed 43% reduction target (relative to 2005, when emissions were close to the record high) is not particularly ambitious. More can be achieved with suitable policies, and more is needed to position Australia for a decarbonising world economy. In industry, Labor plans to activate the dormant “safeguard mechanism”. It should do this ambitiously, to create meaningful rewards for emissions savings and penalties for high emissions right across Australia’s industry sector. This can then evolve into a future comprehensive national carbon price. The political hangup about carbon pricing needs to be overcome. Many other countries use it successfully, and it is a logical part of long term policy for Australia. In electricity, speedy expansion of the power grid and energy storage is needed to underpin continued large scale private investments in wind and solar power. We need meaningful electricity market reform, and low emissions should become formally part of the objectives that the regulators work to. The federal government is needed to make the push in unison with the states. In transport we need a faster rollout of electric vehicle charging and smart grid integration. Road tax reform can ensure that all cars pay for road use, differentiated for carbon emissions, local air pollution and congestion. And governments need to massively invest in better public transport because ever more cars is not the answer. The agenda for the building sector should include meaningful national energy efficiency standards, and building codes that support the use of low carbon materials. In agriculture, R&amp;D can help the farm sector shift to lower-emission practices and products. Land use could be regulated for emissions outcomes. Research and planning for effective adaptation to the effects of climate change needs to be greatly boosted. And we should engage much more with our neighbours in the Pacific and south-east Asia, both to help adapt to climate impacts and to collaborate on lowering emissions. Money spent in these ways will pay dividends. For the coal industry we need a planned approach to regional structural adjustment. An agreed timeline for closure of the remaining coal power plants would help. Economic diversification for coalmining regions needs to be prepared long in advance of mine closures. Labor’s proposed “reconstruction fund” would help fund specific initiatives, but it would make sense to also draw on the industries themselves to fund orderly closure of power stations and mines. And then there is the big resource industry upside, namely our renewable energy opportunity from the global shift to net zero emissions. Australia could produce and export huge amounts of clean energy as hydrogen, ammonia or electrons, and perhaps more importantly “green” energy intensive products like fertiliser, aluminium and steel. To be in the running for these new global markets, we need to ramp up applied research, make sure that Indigenous communities agree and benefit, get regulation and taxation frameworks in place, and tell the world that we are ready and willing to play on zero-carbon. The new government has the chance to lead with gusto, and the time to do so is now. • Frank Jotzo is professor of environmental economics and climate change economics at ANU Crawford School of Public Policy at ANU"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/07/onward-inertia-the-secret-source-for-keeping-the-lights-on-and-greening-the-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-07T08:00:39Z","webTitle":"Onward inertia!

The secret source for keeping the lights on and greening the grid","bodyText":"As the world scrambles to counter the threat posed by Vladimir Putin, you might think the last thing we need is more inertia. But while one definition of that word is “a tendency to do nothing”, it also refers to a process that could play a pivotal role in removing fossil fuels from the UK electricity grid, making the country less reliant on gas supplies, including those from Russia. The National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) is announcing a “trail-blazing” greener way of generating inertia, that if all goes to plan should also reduce carbon emissions, rein in household bills and recoup the £336m investment funding it. In this context, the word refers to the tendency in physics for objects to continue in a state of rest or motion, unless another force acts on them. A spinning top exhibits inertia, in that it will keep spinning until friction with the ground eventually causes it to stop. In the electricity system, inertia is crucial in maintaining a stable electrical frequency on the grid, keeping the lights on. In August 2019, more than one million people across the UK were plunged into darkness during one of the worst power blackouts in more than a decade, after the frequency of the grid fell from its usual 50Hz to 48.88Hz. That unprecedented loss of power generation was caused by a lightning strike, but outages can happen for other reasons too, causing a sudden shortfall that knocks the system’s frequency off kilter. As things stand, the grid system usually balances itself automatically thanks to the inertia held in massive spinning turbines at coal and gas power stations – much like a spinning top, but 19.5 metres (64ft) long and made of 300 tonnes of steel and aluminium. They respond instantaneously to a power outage happening elsewhere, spinning ever so slightly slower to offset the disruption and keep the system stable. However, these giant turbines are not a feature of wind or solar power generation, meaning that as the UK aims to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2025 as part of efforts to hit net zero, inertia needs to come from somewhere else. The solution, according to National Grid ESO, whose job it is keeps the electricity network in check, is a series of green turbines created to mimic the effect of their cousins at carbon-emitting fossil fuel plants. With only a small amount of energy fed into them, they can spin at the required rate of 3000RPM, the speed that ensures synchronicity with the 50hz Grid system. The result, in theory, is a solution to the problem of creating inertia in an increasingly wind- and solar-powered electricity system, allowing for a faster push away from fossil fuels that emit carbon and line the pockets of countries such as Russia. In a deployment that puts the UK at the forefront of grid decarbonisation, 2022 is the year these green turbines begin to make their impact. Two got up and running at Keith Greener Grid Park, in Moray, Scotland in late December last year, with four more coming on stream this year. Rassau in south Wales went live last month, a fourth will start spinning at Killingholme in Lincolnshire within weeks, followed by Grain in Kent and Lister Drive in Liverpool this summer. “Building a green system with enough inertia is an engineering challenge for system operators worldwide and we’re the first to be solving it,” says the head of networks at National Grid ESO, Julian Leslie. The ESO believes that it has solved the inertia problem in a way that should make electricity generation cheaper, as well as greener. It has spent £328m on six years of inertia services from the green turbines, set against the £456m it would normally pay, a saving of £21m a year on the portion of electricity bills accounted for by operation of the grid. In addition, a further £7.5m has been spent on a pioneering “sonar” tool, which the grid refers to as the world’s first “ultracapacitor”, based on Teesside. It will send out pulses of energy into the electricity system, precisely measuring the effect on inertia of tiny factors like people using washing machines or vacuum cleaners, in order to ensure grid stability. “It’s a phenomenal thing that nobody has ever done before,” says Leslie. Looking ahead, the next stage in the evolution of this process could be even smarter, with inertia produced not by spinning turbines but by little black boxes, called grid forming inverters, that replicate the laws of physics. The use of these, another world first, could be included in contracts due to be announced in the coming months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/nov/08/china-calls-for-concrete-action-not-distant-targets-in-last-week-of-cop26","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-08T11:00:29Z","webTitle":"China calls for concrete action not distant targets in last week of Cop26","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/08/china-calls-for-concrete-action-not-distant-targets-in-last-week-of-cop26","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/nov/08/china-calls-for-concrete-action-not-distant-targets-in-last-week-of-cop26","fields":{"headline":"China calls for concrete action not distant targets in last week of Cop26","bodyText":"Chinese officials are sceptical of claims that Cop26 commitments will keep global heating below 2C, and want other countries to focus on concrete actions rather than distant targets in the final week of the talks. They feel that China, the world’s biggest emitter, is doing more than it is given credit for, including plans to peak coal consumption by 2025 and add more new wind and solar power capacity by 2030 than the entire installed electricity system of the US. “There has been a lot of criticism of China’s attitude in the media, but many of them are based on incomprehension or misunderstanding,” said Wang Yi, a senior adviser to the Chinese delegation. During the first week of the UN climate talks in Glasgow, China has been portrayed at times as a reluctant laggard in the effort to keep global heating to 1.5C. The US president, Joe Biden, said it was a “big mistake” for his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, not to show up. China’s climate plan disappointed many because it contained no fresh ambition, and the country was notably absent from alliances to reduce methane emissions and phase out coal. But Wang, a key consultant on China’s decarbonisation strategy and five-year plan, said his country had delivered a policy framework and detailed roadmap to cut emissions, while other nations were congratulating themselves on vague long-term promises. He is sceptical of a recent estimate by the International Energy Agency and others that the pledges made in Glasgow could constrain global heating to 1.8 or 1.9C. “Based on our research, I can’t see evidence that we can reach 1.9C,” he said. “But whether we are now on course for 1.9C or 2.7C, the main point is that we should focus on concrete action.” Wang expressed frustration that the scale, depth and details of China’s climate actions were not appreciated. “Unfortunately, China cannot change the China narrative,” he said. “To reach our targets, we have outlined a change to our entire system, not just in the energy sector but across society and the economy. Nobody knows this.” China has released five documents detailing plans to achieve its dual goals of peaking carbon emissions in 2030 and reaching net zero by 2060. “If you read those reports you can find all of our actions, but nobody reads everything,” he said. As an example, he said the working guidance document on carbon peaking and neutrality outlined a strict control on the increase of coal consumption during the 14th five-year period and then a gradual reduction during the following five years. “That means China will peak coal consumption around 2025, though that is not a line you will see in the document. You need to interpret it and nobody [outside China] can do that.” Similarly, he said the government 1+N policy system provided a roadmap of 37 tasks that the country needed to take until 2060 on areas ranging from legislation and policy to technology and finance. There will be another 30 documents published in the coming year that break down actions needed in key sectors, such as building and transport, as well as major industries including steel and chemicals. “No country has issued so many documents to support its targets,” he said. “It’s a holistic solution, but nobody knows.” China’s two different targets pose very different challenges, he said. “The peaking issue is easy. More difficult is how to achieve neutrality … We are in transition. Our concern in the future is not that China is too slow, but that it is too fast.” He said the recent power shortages in China proved how serious it had been in shutting down overcapacity in its coal sector. Every decision had major consequences. “Our coal-fired plants have a life of 10 to 12 years. If we shut them down, who will pay for the stranded assets? Who will employ the laid-off workers?” Decarbonisation is already under way. By the end of this decade, the government plans to reach 1200GW of wind and solar power, which would exceed the entire installed electricity capacity of the US, he said. The final week of Cop26 will tackle the most contentious issues on the climate agenda. For China, the priority is to finalise the Paris rulebook, which will determine how money should flow across borders in support of decarbonisation, forest protection and other climate actions. As at previous Cops, China will also push wealthy nations to make greater financial contributions to developing countries, which have done least to cause the climate crisis but suffer most from its consequences. Wang pointed out that the 2009 promise of $100bn (£73bn) a year in climate finance had yet to be realised and far more than this would be needed in the future to accelerate the pace of decarbonisation. “China would like more effort on supporting developing countries,” he said. “If we are going to aim for 1.5C instead of 2C, then there has to be an increase in the funds available to make that happen.” Much remains to be done, but negotiation teams have less capacity than at previous Cops. Wang said China’s strict Covid regulations had pared down the entire delegation. “When we go back, we will have to isolate for 21 days,” he said. “So our negotiating delegations this time is just 50 people, compared with several hundred in Paris.” He said Xi Jinping was not attending for the same reason. The fact that the Chinese president only sent a printed statement rather than a video was widely reported in the media as a snub, but Wang said this was incorrect because China had suggested a video message but the UK hosts felt it was not permitted. China has been hesitant about pushing for a 1.5C target, which would require far more drastic actions. Wang recognised that small island nations may insist on this ambitious goal, but said it should not be to the detriment of other objectives. “1.5C is possible, but it would carry a cost, social and economic. If we cannot solve these problems equally, especially for developing countries, then it is not a real target.” “We are all in the same boat, but different cabins,” he said. “Some live in a big space and eat too much. We need balance.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/apr/28/hear-here-cate-blanchett-climate-of-change-podcast","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-28T08:45:05Z","webTitle":"Best podcasts of the week: Cate Blanchett gets curious about climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/28/hear-here-cate-blanchett-climate-of-change-podcast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/28/hear-here-cate-blanchett-climate-of-change-podcast","fields":{"headline":"Best podcasts of the week: Cate Blanchett gets curious about climate change","bodyText":"Picks of the week Climate of Change Audible, all episodes out now “I am categorically overwhelmed,” announces Cate Blanchett, as she drives an electric car in the intro to her new eco podcast.

HV There’s a podcast for that This week, Rachel Aroesti picks five of the best investigative podcasts, from a 1950s poltergeist mystery to a decade-long catfishing case The Battersea Poltergeist In 1956, a ghost named Donald began violently pursuing 15-year-old Shirley Hitchings in her family home – or at least, that’s what she believed. The apparent haunting would continue for the next 12 years, grabbing plenty of hysterical headlines along the way. In this fascinating and occasionally chilling podcast, host Danny Robins attempts to make sense of this ordeal by talking to experts, witnesses and Shirley herself, as well as thoroughly examining the likelihood of the many different logical explanations put forward by his interviewees and listeners. West Cork True crime – in both television and podcast form – has a fine line to tread in moral terms, especially when dealing with the brutal and high-profile murder of a woman. But voyeuristicor gratuitous are not adjectives you could ever apply to West Cork, an investigation by British documentarian Jennifer Forde and her journalist husband Sam Bungey into the 1996 killing of French television producer Sophie Toscan du Plantier in a remote part of Ireland. Impeccably researched and scrupulously even-handed, the 13-part series features hours of in-depth interviews with practically everyone involved in the case – including the self-mythologising prime suspect. Mystery Show Not all investigations are disturbing or dark: this series from This American Life contributor (and, more recently, a writer on offbeat comedy-drama Search Party) Starlee Kine only ran for six episodes in 2015, but its host’s optimism, idiosyncrasy and sterling detective work means it’s become a podcast classic. Shot through with Kine’s distinctive humour, the show takes on a series of amusing conundrums – a disappearing video store; an astonishingly intricate belt buckle found on the street; Jake Gyllenhaal’s seemingly changing height – and actually gets some answers. Really, though, it’s Kine’s ability to connect with the strangers she encounters that makes Mystery Show such a profound, life-affirming joy. Sweet Bobby Sometimes investigative podcasts revive a cold case, or revisit a job the police quite clearly botched. Sweet Bobby – hosted by reporter Alexi Mostrous – takes a different tack, attempting to get to the bottom of something that seems like it should be a crime, but actually falls through the legislative cracks. The story belongs to Kirat Assi, now in her 40s, who spent a decade being catfished by her female cousin. What Kirat doesn’t understand – and what Mostrous duly digs into – is the motivation behind this disturbing deception. Drilled Billed as a “true crime podcast about climate change,” this long-running series hosted by investigative reporter Amy Westervelt is concerned with the ways corporations and politicians alike have impeded climate change action: themes include everything from greenwashing to Big Oil pushing consumer guilt and the funding of outright climate denial. In fact, with over 100 episodes in the can, there are few areas Westervelt hasn’t explored with both thoroughness and rigour. Drilled’s knotty, involved style does mean it requires deliberate, focused listening – but it’s difficult to think of many topics more deserving of your full concentration.

The car continued to barrel down the open stretch of road, its speed dipping only slightly. “It keeps on going,” said Grooten, the lead engineer for the Dutch car company Lightyear, as we whizzed through the lunar-like landscape. “What you feel is nothing holding you back. You feel the aerodynamics, you feel the low-rolling resistance of the tyres, of the bearings and the motor.” It is this streamlined design that the company credits for allowing it to muscle its way into a space long overlooked by most car manufacturers. As early as November, the company will start delivery of what it describes as the “world’s first production-ready solar car” – the Lightyear 0, a €250,000 (£215,000) sedan draped in 5 sq metres of curved solar panels that top up the electric battery while the car is driving or parked outdoors. “If we would have the same amount of energy that we harvest on these panels on any other car that uses three times the amount of energy to drive, it becomes useless. It becomes a very expensive gimmick,” said Grooten. “You have to build this car from the ground up, to make it as efficient as possible, to make it this feasible.” In optimal conditions, the solar panels can add up to 44 miles a day to the 388-mile range the car gets between charges, according to the company. Tests carried out by Lightyear suggest people with a daily commute of less than 22 miles could drive for two months in the Netherlands without needing to plug in, while those in sunnier climes such as Portugal or Spain could go as long as seven months. But whether the company’s gamble on solar will pay off remains to be seen, said Jim Saker, professor emeritus at Loughborough University and president of the Institute of the Motor Industry. “You’re having to pay an awful lot of money and have solar panels stuck on the car for just 44 additional miles. The question mark at the moment is the fact that, in reality, is that actually worth it? The actual concept isn’t bad. It’s just whether the technology is actually viable to make it economically sustainable for anybody wanting to do this.” Sales of the Lightyear 0 would probably be limited to a handful of early adopters, he added. “But in reality, it’s not a commercial proposition at the moment.” Others questioned the idea of a car being touted as a salve to the ever deepening climate crisis. “The most sustainable way to approach car ownership is actually to avoid it entirely, if you can at all,” said Vera O’Riordan, a PhD student focusing on low-carbon pathways and policies for passenger transport at University College Cork in Ireland. While electric vehicles may have a limited role to play in rural areas that lack public transport, she cited research suggesting these vehicles are often sold to high-income households in urban areas. “So you have to ask yourself the question: are you serving this individualised, very inefficient, very harmful and traffic-inducing transport in urban areas where it could otherwise be perfectly met by public transport and walking and cycling?” The need to move away from cars to tackle the climate emergency is – perhaps surprisingly – echoed by Lex Hoefsloot, the 31-year-old chief executive of Lightyear, who has raised about €150m in investment to get it running. “It would be great, I fully agree,” he said. “But I think we’re not going to change our lives too much. Perhaps, when we’re really panicking in 20 years, we might. But in the meantime, we have to work around that.” Since 2016 the company has championed solar energy as a key part of this work-around, envisioning solar cars capable of running on clean energy and accelerating the transition away from polluting fossil fuels. “People were saying it wasn’t possible, mostly because of the limited amount of solar power you could get on a car,” said Hoefsloot. His own experience, however, suggested otherwise. The Lightyear 0 – a sleek four-wheel drive – traces its roots to a squat box-on-wheels that ferried four helmet-clad university students across the Australian outback to win in its class in the 2013 world solar challenge. “If it works in Australia, then it works everywhere. That was the thinking,” said Hoefsloot, who founded Lightyear with four other members of the solar challenge team. “Early days, I must admit there was a hesitation whether we should go full car manufacturing, because we all know it’s not the easiest thing. But there was nobody else out there that was really willing to or doing something similar.” In recent years there has been an upswell of interest in integrating solar panels into cars: Mercedes-Benz recently revealed plans to outfit an upcoming electric car with rooftop solar panels, while Toyota has at times offered limited-capacity solar panels as an add-on to its Prius hybrid. Next year, Munich-based Sono Motors plans to roll out a €28,500 solar-assisted family car, while the California-based startup Aptera Motors said in 2020 that preorders for its futuristic three-wheeled solar electric vehicle sold out in less than 24 hours. With months left before the Lightyear 0’s production run, there are still kinks to be worked out, from a stiff steering wheel to the buzz that at times fills the car when the air conditioning kicks in. Once you are in the car, there is little about the driving experience that feels different from other electric cars – “That’s a huge compliment, that’s what we’re aiming for,” one staff member tells me – save for a smattering of reminders about the constant drip feed of solar energy. One screen shows exactly what cells are feeding off the sun at any given moment, while another quantifies how much solar energy is being absorbed. In an effort to use as much of this solar energy as possible, the windswept design eschews side-view mirrors for cameras and runs off lightweight electric motors tucked into its wheels. The body panels are crafted from reclaimed carbon fibre and the interiors are fashioned from vegan, plant-based leather with fabrics made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate bottles. The 20-minute test run is probably the only time I will sit at the wheel of the Lightyear 0. With its hefty price tag – ideally paid by those who have an outdoor parking space to maximise the car’s gain from the sun – it is not a car for the masses. Instead, the company envisions the production run, which will offer up to 946 vehicles for delivery across Europe and the UK, as a beginning of sorts. “This is a small scale to validate to the world that we can produce a car,” said Telian Franken, the prototype team lead. From there, the company will shift its focus to a second solar-assisted electric car it is aiming to sell for about €30,000 as early as 2025. “We’re trying to make the difference, not for the millionaire who can afford a €250,000 car, but to get us to the point where the average person can get off grid – get a reliable sustainable vehicle that beats toe-for-toe any econo-box you can get at the time,” said Franken, citing the Toyota Corolla or Honda Accord as examples. “That’s what we’re trying to beat – and replace – because it’s not sustainable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/jan/21/uk-africa-off-grid-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-21T18:12:46Z","webTitle":"UK could tap into Africa's $24bn market for off-grid solar power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/21/uk-africa-off-grid-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/jan/21/uk-africa-off-grid-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"UK could tap into Africa's $24bn market for off-grid solar power","bodyText":"UK investors could seize a $24bn investment opportunity by helping to connect millions of people without access to electricity to off-grid home solar power systems. The market for pay-as-you-go home solar packages is expected to boom in Africa, where millions of homes are using mobile technology to rent low-cost solar panels. UK companies have played a leading role in helping more than five million households sign up to pay-as-you-go home solar systems in the past four years. But with 600 million people without access to an electricity grid, there is huge potential for future investment. A report by Kleos Advisory, published during the first UK-Africa Investment Summit in London, has found that the commercial opportunity from off-grid solar panels could generate about $24bn (£18bn) a year. The market is growing rapidly since the collapse in the cost of solar panel technologies and the emergence of mobile banking and affordable financing in the continent’s fast-growing economies. Households that earn an income are increasingly using mobile phones to rent small-scale solar panels, and ultra-efficient electric lighting strips and appliances to access electricity for the first time. Once the solar panels are paid off, households own the equipment outright and in effect have free energy. Many then choose to upgrade their packages to add televisions and electric cookers. The off-grid solar market is expected to grow rapidly, in part because eight of the world’s 15 fastest-growing economies are in Africa. Tedd George, the author of the report, said the combination of solar technology and affordable financing was “driving an economic transformation in Africa, making the ‘unbankable’ bankable and embedding African consumers in the digital economy”. UK companies including Azuri Technologies, which commissioned the report, and Bboxx are racing to corner the market for off-grid solar in Africa with the help of private investment and major international companies. Azuri sells its home solar systems in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Nigeria, and Bboxx is active in Kenya, Togo, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Mali, Rwanda, Senegal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria. The scale of the off-grid solar market across Africa has emerged as UK investment leaders consider future investment in the continent after Brexit. Tony Blair said the summit this week “should open a new chapter in Britain’s relationship with Africa” to one based on “economic cooperation rather than simply an aid-based, donor-recipient relationship”. The former Labour prime minister said: “If we can use the UK-Africa Investment Summit to become a true economic partner to African countries, it would be of great strategic benefit to the continent and to the UK.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2022/apr/21/in-australias-election-campaign-the-silence-on-climate-is-deafening","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-21T00:41:20Z","webTitle":"In Australia's election campaign the silence on climate is deafening | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2022/apr/21/in-australias-election-campaign-the-silence-on-climate-is-deafening","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2022/apr/21/in-australias-election-campaign-the-silence-on-climate-is-deafening","fields":{"headline":"In Australia’s election campaign the silence on climate is deafening","bodyText":"The week before the election was called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its third and final report on the IPCC’s review of climate science, detailing the likelihood of temperatures rising 1.5C (almost certainly) and 2C above pre-industrial levels. It was pretty shocking reading; and it has been completely ignored during the campaign. On Tuesday it seemed finally climate change was going to appear in the election campaign. Alas, as Adam Morton noted, it was an appearance characterised by fear and numbers plucked from nowhere – too often seen in Australia these past 20 years. Sigh. After reviewing the press conferences and interviews of the two leaders up until Tuesday, I found no mention among about 160 questions asked of Scott Morrison that went close to the issue. The best I could find was in the seat of Gilmore, when he was asked “What is your government doing to mediate potential bushfires?” Morrison responded that it required “action to reduce carbon emissions” and that “Australia’s emissions have fallen by around 20 per cent”, which he said was “many times over what has been achieved in Canada and New Zealand and the United States.” Such a line is so specious and oft repeated that you would think everyone has a quick retort ready by now. But no. Always remember Australia’s emissions cuts since 2005 only look good if you count the massive level of land clearing that occurred in 2005. If you look at actual emissions that exclude land use, Australia is not doing well at all: If the graph does not display click here Questioning Morrison on climate change really should be easy. After all, there is so much evidence to use. As Nine’s Nick O’Malley reported on Tuesday, the latest Green Future Index, published by MIT, has Australia plunging down the world ranking from a mediocre 35th to 52nd in the world – wedged between Saudi Arabia and the Philippines. Among the OECD we come second-last: If the graph does not display click here Even worse for Morrison, who trumpeted “technology not taxes” as the way to cut emissions, Australia is currently ranked second-last in the OECD in both categories of “innovation” and “policy”. On a global level, Australia’s level of clean innovation comes in at 68th out of the 76 nations that were reviewed. Clearly, when it comes to technology, the prime minister means someone else’s. Of course the government’s path to net zero by 2050, released last year, so greatly relied on technology that it only bothered to chart a path to emissions 85% below 2005 levels – the remainder was left to the hopes and dreams of technology yet to be discovered: If the graph does not display click here For Anthony Albanese, climate change has been slightly more present among his 180-odd questions. But mostly they are not how is he going to limit coal, given the warning of the IPCC, but what is he going to do to keep it. For example, he was asked if he could “guarantee that people, workers, in towns like Cessnock and other resources towns around Australia, that none of them will lose their jobs as a result of those policies”. Thankfully one (yes one!) journalist did ask the ALP leader about emissions, asking “The UN is saying we actually need at least 45 [per cent] to keep below 1.5C warming. The Climate Change Authority also says between 45 and 60. Why have you gone 43, why have not gone 45 or higher?” It was a good question. Albanese replied “what we didn’t do was say, ‘OK, let’s pick a number and work back from there’. What we did is we went, ‘What is good policy? What makes a difference?’” It is weird answer that suggests policy development is akin to suggesting that you shouldn’t worry about how far you are from the cliff, but that you should just put your foot on the brake in a steady manner and hope that is good enough. As it is, the IPCC outlined the paths required to stay under a 2C or 1.5C temperature rise, and it suggests the ALP likely has a target within the range needed to keep within a 2C increase, but not a 1.5C rise: If the graph does not display click here The government’s target, however, is right on the edge of what might limit temperature rises to 2C but is nowhere near that needed to keep them below 1.5C. And within all of this discussion we need to remember our carbon budget – the total amount Australia is able to emit from now to do its share to limit warming. Under the current projections, both parties’ policies would see Australia breach its 1.5C carbon budget in 2028. Under the Coalition’s policy, by 2030 it would have used up 78% of the 2C budget, while the ALP’s 2030 target would see 70% of the budget used: If the graph does not display click here That means we will need massive cuts after 2030 if we want to stay within our budget: If the graph does not display click here All of this deserves attention, rather than fear campaigns about costs or lost jobs. Instead, perhaps journalists could note the IPCC’s finding that “cost reductions in key technologies, notably wind power, solar power and storage, have increased the economic attractiveness of low-emission energy sector transitions through 2030”. And even more potent is the finding that “maintaining emission-intensive systems may, in some regions and sectors, be more expensive than transitioning to low emission systems”. • Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/feb/24/the-west-syria-ukraine-us-allies-vladimir-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-24T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"The west stood back and watched in Syria – it must not do the same in Ukraine | Hamish de Bretton-Gordon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/24/the-west-syria-ukraine-us-allies-vladimir-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/24/the-west-syria-ukraine-us-allies-vladimir-putin","fields":{"headline":"The west stood back and watched in Syria – it must not do the same in Ukraine","bodyText":"The Syria crisis continues unnoticed. It holds key lessons for the west about Putin yet it has gone virtually unnoticed by the rest of the world. War crimes and crimes against humanity continue in the Russian-sponsored dictatorship, even as some misguided leaders want to usher Bashar al-Assad, the architect of these crimes, back into acceptable society. We can rest assured that the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, unlike Assad, is not welcoming Putin with open arms. But in responding to the Ukraine emergency, there are lessons the west can and should learn from the situation in Syria. Since the UN removed Syria’s declared chemical weapons stockpile in 2014, Assad has continued to bomb hospitals and schools, and burn villages to the ground in a macabre, medieval-style scorched-earth policy. Mercifully, we have not seen chemical weapons used since April 2019, but Syria today is a Russian state in all but name, and Assad a puppet dictator with strings very clearly tugged from Moscow. Idlib, a province in northwest Syria, is the only region still free of the tyranny, but with millions of malnourished souls trapped there, and Assad throwing in incendiary devices to smoke them out as you would vermin, it still resembles hell on earth. Even the UN has turned its back on Idlib, giving aid to Assad and his wife to distribute as they see fit. Syria now represents a major Russian and Iranian presence on the edge of Europe; and if Ukraine also falls, the balance of power will very much shift eastwards. With too many European countries reliant on Russian gas, the current global instability began in Damascus. An emboldened Russia buoyed up by high oil prices seems much more willing to face off with Nato than it did a few years ago, when its antiquated military was no match for western tanks. While the rest of us have cut our militaries to the bone, relying on electronics and space to fight the next war, Russia has modernised its armoured might, now on show around Ukraine – there is a unique quality in mass and heavy armour, which no cyberwarrior is going to vaporise. Syria shows what happens when you turn a blind eye and are too heavily influenced by peaceniks. Those of us involved in interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 30 years have our issues with overstepping the mark in those places, but we look at Syria and know we should have done better. That knowledge should inform our response to Putin’s aggression now. It is clear when discussing Syria with Syrians from Idlib and regime-held areas that everybody has suffered. At least those in Idlib are getting support through Turkey, and there are some innovative projects being funded by European countries. Many hospitals and clinics in Idlib now have solar power to run their generators and surgical theatres, as there is no fuel and the power network was destroyed years ago. There is an electric car, also powered by solar energy, distributing medicines and Covid vaccines – when they are occasionally available – around Idlib. In a remarkable twist that would only happen in war, some of these Syrian medics who have developed a viable medical system under the most trying and demanding circumstances are now offering to help in Afghanistan. The Syrian people have shown resilience and innovation beyond compare, even as they have been let down again and again. First, the west did not intervene when the regime started attacking its own people. Then, in response to chemical weapon use, illegal under every rule of war, the US declared a red line on their use – but failed to act when that line was crossed. And finally, we stood by as Russia and Iran muscled their way across Syria to create a forward operation base on our doorstep. Our leaders will do well to remember this and be strong and resilient to protect Ukraine. I cannot think that a few sanctions on a few banks and billionaires is going to perturb Putin. He only understands strength and power – it’s time to show our steel.

All kinds of people with no interest in football found themselves caught up in it, seduced by the generational significance of the confrontation between Mbappé, who scored a hat-trick, and Messi – Paris Saint-Germain teammates at opposite ends of their careers. World Cup finals are normally turgid, terrified affairs, won by the side that makes the fewest mistakes. In this one, two great players rose fearlessly to the occasion, lifted by their teammates’ wild commitment to their cause. Nobody who watched will forget it. It was a victory for Fifa and Qatar, too: football’s most irresistible stars making good their bet on the beautiful game’s power to make you forget every other kind of ugliness. Today’s newsletter will take you through the Guardian’s best writing on an incredible football match, the two great players who defined it, the fans who lived every minute of it, and the tournament’s inescapable sportswashing success. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Tesco | Burmese workers that produced F+F jeans for Tesco in Thailand report being trapped in effective forced labour, working 99-hour weeks for illegally low pay in appalling conditions, a Guardian investigation has found. 130 former workers art VK Garment Factory are suing Tesco for alleged negligence. Strikes | The health secretary, Steve Barclay, is expected to seek new talks with health unions to avert further strikes, as ambulance staff prepare for a walkout on Wednesday. It comes as No 10 rejected a proposal to give nurses a one-off lump-sum payment in an attempt to end the industrial action. US politics | California congressman Adam Schiff has said that there is sufficient evidence to charge Donald Trump with criminal offences over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. On Monday, the January 6 panel is expected to refer Trump to the US justice department. Biodiversity | A potentially transformational agreement for nature is close to being reached at Cop15 in Montreal, which could bring better protection for rainforests, big reforms to agriculture and better protection of indigenous territories and rights. But there are concerns that key areas are being overlooked. Twitter | Elon Musk has asked Twitter users whether he should step down as the head of the company, promising to abide by the results of a poll he posted on the site. A few minutes before this email was sent, 56% of more than 13m voters said that he should go. In depth: ‘One of the greatest games in history’ Lionel Messi had it sewn up. Kylian Mbappé bust it back open. Emiliano Martínez made the save of a lifetime to take the game to penalties, and then produced an outrageous/magnificent display of gamesmanship in the shootout to give Messi his crowning triumph. This photo gallery captures some of the drama. It understandably skips Martinez’s exuberantly immature celebration. “Argentina had to win this final three times, France refusing to accept it was Messi’s destiny to get his hands on the iconic gold trophy, that it was somehow preordained,” wrote David Hytner, in his comprehensive match report. “It will go down as surely the finest World Cup final of all time, the most pulsating, one of the greatest games in history.” As ever, the minute-by-minute version captures the wild oscillations in momentum with an immediacy that returns you to each scarcely believable reversal. “Hello! Hello!” wrote Scott Murray on 79 minutes, as Kolo Muani won the penalty which Mbappé would then convert. “There’s no point trying to second guess this match,” he added, as normal time came to an end, adding a few minutes later: “This is wild!” In the second-half of extra time: “Argentina retake the lead, and the stadium takes off into space. What a noise!” And when Messi finally sank to his knees at the shootout’s end: “He smiles, sparkling like a young boy, just a happy lad. What a performance! What a career! What a final.” *** The superstars Almost everyone who isn’t French (and even some of them, according to France manager Didier Deschamps) had the same sentimental outcome in mind: a crowning display of greatness for Messi, securing the one major honour that has eluded him and only then passing the baton to Mbappé. “Of course,” wrote Jacob Steinberg, in his assessment of the French performance, “fairytale endings are often ripped up when Mbappé grabs the script. Even Messi could feel the narrative slipping away.” In the end, though, Messi held on to his pre-eminent status for just long enough. (As if that wasn’t enough, Mbappé then had to endure the insistent consolations of France’s president Emmanuel Macron.) It was, wrote Barney Ronay, a “kind of coronation, belatedly, for the greatest footballer of the age, probably of any age, the mooching 35-year-old mobile brain Lionel Messi, a thousand games into his astonishing career.” Once again, Messi prevailed while moving more slowly than almost anybody else on the pitch: except, said Ronay, “Messi’s walking is not really walking. It’s thinking. Walking is his rapid eye movement, his spinning disc while he crunches the code. Messi walks three miles a game. He is not doing this to get his steps up.” “He had played here like destiny called,” Sid Lowe wrote, in a fine tribute to “the man who exhausted adjectives”. “This was his cup; there has never been a story like this, a competition so centred around one man – although an immense challenger appeared here – everyone waiting for the finishing touch, the perfect farewell.” *** The fans As the game started in La Puerta Roja, a bar in downtown Buenos Aires, “The air smelled of adrenaline and the commentators could barely be heard over the din of yelling, hands banging on tables, and the occasional glass smashing,” wrote Amy Booth, in her fantastically evocative piece from the Argentinian capital. But after the euphoria of a seemingly impregnable lead, Mbappé’s two goals in two minutes “dampened the mood like an ice bath”. As extra time began, “at least one person was breathing into a paper bag.” When victory was finally secured, fans in the city centre (pictured above) made the streets “a carnivalesque cacophony of cheers, car horns, cumbia music and bullhorns”. For a country in the grip of a currency crisis, with inflation at almost 100%, throughout the tournament “there has been a sense that Argentina’s national psyche badly needed a victory”. This video captures the celebrations. And this one. And this one. And this one. And this one. In Paris, Jon Henley found Le Napoléon and Le Mondial cafes “rammed to the rafters inside with flag-waving, face-painted, red-white-and-blue bewigged fans”. At 2-0 down, Salma and Leila were outside and ready to go: “It’s way too cold,” said Salma. “And anyway, the match is over.” Salma was wrong. When Argentina did finally prevail, the mood was one of acceptance: “We can’t really complain, can we?” said Karim. “We fought, came so close, by the end we’d given really everything we had. It so nearly happened.” Earlier, Philippe Moreau in Le Napoléon had summarised the inevitability of their opponent: “You can’t begrudge him. He is Messi.” *** The legacy The trap of this World Cup, as Barney Ronay observed, is the way Fifa and Qatar have so ruthlessly co-opted everything beautiful about the game in the service of a “$7bn sporting extravaganza”, a tournament that is built on “a global labour market that drives migrant workers into lucrative near-captivity; a system Qatar did not create, which it has simply embodied with manic hypercompetence”. Messi and Mbappé, he notes, are both “paid ambassadors of Qatar Sports Investments via dizzying contracts with Paris Saint-Germain”. This tournament’s success is “the real thing: end-to-end fully encrypted sportswashing. It is an incredible feat of will.” Earlier in the tournament, chief executive Nasser al-Khater’s responded to a question about the death of a migrant worker by saying: “death is a part of life … we have a successful World Cup, and this is something you want to talk about right now?” The relative weight he attributed to those two priorities was borne out by this remarkable match’s ability to mute every other concern. It was grim, but not that surprising, to see Elon Musk and Jared Kushner cheerlessly watching on. Messi floats above that reality, but his greatness doesn’t change it. One of the defining images of this tournament came in his walk to bring the trophy to his teammates, with Fifa President Gianni Infantino and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, at his side (pictured above). He began to move away, but there they still were in the background – clinging to his coattails, trailing in his wake. What else we’ve been reading Celebrities are just like us – they fall in love!

Cartoon of the day | Edith Pritchett The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad Lynmouth Road is a street in northeast London. Historically, it was built on the marshland on the banks of the River Lea. For a long time it was a working-class area home to residents that would live their for decades – but in recent years, because of transport links and good schools, house prices have more than doubled. A couple who live on the street have been on a mission to both rekindle a sense of community and make their lives more sustainable by turning their neighbourhood into its own solar power station. Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powell are living on their roof as part of a crowdfunder for the project. Buying and installing solar panels is an expensive endeavour – but over time, the hope is to make this scheme into a reality to combat the energy crisis and become more sustainable, together. If all goes to plan, the first of the solar panels will go up early next year. “We can be powerful, us, the people who should be powerless,” says Edelstyn. “We do have the power to change things.” Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday Bored at work?

Back in July 2018 – when Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg were attempting to land the national energy guarantee (Neg), wedged uncomfortably between post-truth rightwingers and state governments increasingly annoyed about being conscripted to an omnishambles – the Energy Security Board (ESB) ran out of patience. Perhaps you haven’t heard of the ESB. This particular expert group was formed in August 2017 to implement the recommendations of a review of the national electricity market undertaken by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel. The Finkel review hit political turbulence about a nanosecond after it hit the public domain, because the chief scientist recommended a clean energy target as one of the policy mechanisms to drive the necessary transition to low emissions in Australia’s power grid. Because renewables were involved, this was a thought crime. Tony Abbott and a posse of fellow mumbo jumbo enthusiasts declared they would cross the floor and sink it. Faced with a brewing leadership proxy war, Turnbull and Frydenberg regrouped quickly with the ESB and proposed the Neg instead. If you’ve forgotten the Neg, that policy would have imposed two obligations on energy retailers: an obligation to supply sufficient quantities of “reliable” power to the market, and an obligation to reduce emissions over the decade between 2020 and 2030. This was Turnbull and Frydenberg’s effort to create some policy certainty to facilitate investment in new power generation. Certainty was becoming an absolute imperative, given ageing coal generation was on the way out but there weren’t clear rules of the road governing what should replace it. A number of stakeholders moaned about the Neg because it was a distance short of perfect. What Australia actually needed to manage an orderly transition in the economy generally and the power grid specifically was the carbon price Abbott pretended was an economy-destroying tax in order to win the 2013 election. But the Liberals lost the opportunity of implementing optimal policy options when they joined Abbott’s “axe the tax” cult. A party of government in Australia chose to staple itself to stupid. By July 2018, the real-world debacle created by Abbott’s weaponised lying was hiding in plain sight, and ESB officials were not mincing words. The board basically begged state and territory energy ministers to accept the Neg, even though the emissions reduction target (a 26% cut in electricity emissions by 2030) was very obviously too low. The ESB pointed out it could be ratcheted up down the track. Then the officials appealed to Turnbull and Frydenberg. Actually, they didn’t, because those two were already on board. Their overture was actually to the right faction of the Liberal party. In a report written to be released publicly, the ESB said: “Fifteen years of climate policy instability has impeded long-term investments in the national electricity market and this has compromised system security and reliability”. This policy instability had “impacted electricity prices and added to affordability problems for consumers”. The ESB said Australia’s energy system was now “vulnerable to escalating prices while being both less reliable and secure”. Because the Liberal and National parties had failed to be rational actors focused on the public interest, “increased market intervention has been necessary to maintain the security and reliability of the system and this has further distorted price signals to producers and consumers”. “In short, the uncertainty about climate change policy has severely damaged the electricity industry and its household and business consumers,” the ESB officials said. “This cannot continue”. But of course it did continue. The shenanigans escalated. Turnbull was dumped, along with the Neg. Frydenberg survived the car crash and was promoted to Treasury, and the right faction of the Liberal party was handed the climate and energy portfolio so Scott Morrison didn’t need to look over his shoulder. Angus Taylor became the new minister and promptly created a new cult of “technology not taxes”. The Coalition continued to talk a big game while meddling relentlessly and ineptly at the margins, and over the past few weeks, Australians have been reminded that the national electricity grid is chocked up with discarded wads of talking points and held together with rubber bands and gaffer tape. Given all this – the prospect of blackouts, heaters off, lights out, in the middle of winter – you’d think the Liberal party might finally recover from its self-administered lobotomy. A reasonable person might also speculate that the loss of Wentworth, North Sydney, Mackellar, Kooyong, Goldstein, Curtin, Bennelong, Higgins and Ryan in the electoral rout on 21 May might trigger some kind of internal reckoning. But no. Peter Dutton is doubling down. Without pausing to have a conversation with his still shell-shocked party room colleagues about whether the decade of wrecking might now come to an end, Dutton has made a captain’s call to oppose Labor’s emission target of 43% by 2030 and keep raving about how renewables are destroying the national electricity market while preaching the 2GB gospel that solar power is useless at midnight. On the plus side, at least Dutton isn’t sneaky. The new Liberal party leader is generally very transparent, and his political calculations right at the moment are as obvious as the nose on his face. Dutton thinks events will help bring the new Albanese government undone. Dutton thinks he can summon a cost-of-living shitstorm from rising prices and any blackouts that happen on Labor’s watch. He thinks he can associate the current turbulence and the spasm in the hip pocket nerve with Labor’s 43% emissions reduction target. In the event he’s not able to land his preferred strategy – either because events don’t facilitate it or because the new Liberal leader lacks the requisite suppleness and sparkle to be able to sell Australian voters yet another truckload of bollocks – he and the team might look at pursuing something approximately sensible-adjacent on climate and energy policy closer to the next election. I suspect we are supposed to be grateful for this: this hint of sunny uplands, the suggestion wrecking will ebb the moment it ceases to be politically useful. Now I suspect a number of readers will message me over the weekend declaring they don’t care what Dutton says or does, and scold me for caring. I know I’ll be told Labor has a majority in the House and can start to repair some of the Coalition’s climate and energy destruction with a progressive Senate. This is true enough. But with respect, cancelling Dutton is not only impossible, it misses a central point. Dutton is the alternative prime minister of Australia. Labor not only wants to fix the mess; Anthony Albanese actually wants to end the destructive decade. When the prime minister says he wants to end the climate wars, that’s what he means. He wants to reset the whole apparatus, reaching back to pre-Abbott politics. The success of that project is something we all have a stake in. If Albanese succeeds, he will strengthen Australia democracy. Ending the destructive decade is a far more ambitious undertaking than fixing a bunch of practical problems, however wicked those problems might be, because it requires the other party of government to aspire for something nobler than lying, scheming and brawling their way to the Lodge. Australian voters have sent the Liberal party a very clear message, and by drifting away from the major parties, voters are also choosing new political representation that is more local, community based, and consensual. Dutton is very silly if he misses the cue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/commentisfree/2022/apr/17/entitlement-and-deceit-rule-politic-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-17T05:00:21Z","webTitle":"The deceitful and entitled rule politics | Observer letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/apr/17/entitlement-and-deceit-rule-politic-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/apr/17/entitlement-and-deceit-rule-politic-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson","fields":{"headline":"Letters: the deceitful and entitled rule politics","bodyText":"If, as your editorial suggests, we feel “we are governed by ministers who regard the rules as being for other people” (“Chancellor has damaged faith in democracy”, Comment), it is because they operate with the complacent condescension of Roman patricians, a group that governed by birthright and among whom Boris Johnson behaves like Caesar. It helps to explain what Andrew Rawnsley calls “The stench of entitlement now oozing from Rishi Sunak’s home as well as Mr Johnson’s” (Comment). Rawnsley wonders whether Sunak was “naive, idiotic, complacent, cavalier or arrogant” over his wife’s tax affairs, but once we recognise that Tory ministers think of themselves not as a class but a political caste all becomes clear. Only those who believe that governing is their inherited prerogative could display the indifference, deceit and hypocrisy shown by cabinet ministers over the last two years, to which Mr Sunak has added his sense of outraged privilege. They see no wrong in ringfencing wealth in the midst of massive economic inequality. They are indifferent to criticism unless it might register in a ballot box uncomfortably close to home. They recognise no allegiance to the public they belittle, until it gathers periodically as an electorate. Paul McGilchrist Colchester, Essex Your view that people in Rishi Sunak’s seat (Richmond, Yorkshire) may forgive his latest errors is interesting but decidedly partial (“Sunak’s stunts and mistakes expose lack of political savvy”, News). Many of his constituents have long noted that our local MP rarely misses an opportunity for self-publicity or situations that lend themselves to his seemingly insatiable need to hone the Rishi brand. Our local weekly paper invariably contains two to three “news” items with photos of the MP. These are reinforced with his occasional personally financed glossy pamphlet. This latter publication has a rare and idiosyncratic style (no doubt confected by his private publicist) of using 30-40 self references to “Rishi” over a couple of sides. Local people are not daft; they recognise spin masquerading as “news”. The burghers of Northallerton may well wish to stay calm but many of us in the wider constituency are tiring of our MP’s incessant thirst for publicity. Indeed, many of us believe he’d do well to adopt the Kingsley Amis posture of believing less equals more. Gus Pennington Stokesley, North Yorkshire The silence of solar power Your claim (“Three-quarters of Britons back expansion of wind power”, News) has raised howls of protest in North Devon, where many hills are blighted by the noise and flicker of these giant protrusions. The countryside should not be industrialised in this hideous way. If, instead, every new-build, supermarket, car park, barn, shed and factory were to be compulsorily fitted with solar panels – silent, unobtrusive and comparatively cheap – it would be far better, alongside expanding offshore wind power that, as an island, we have in abundance. We must get to net zero fast, but not by destroying our land and skies. Amanda Craig Lifton, Devon Preventing more Grenfells You report (“Ministers admit ignoring repeated warnings in the years before Grenfell”, News) that Eric Pickles, Gavin Barwell and Stephen Williams, then government ministers, failed to consider the recommendations of the inquest into the Lakanal House fire. I was the solicitor for the families of the three women and three children who died in that fire. Will the Grenfell Tower inquiry consider stating that an obligation should be placed on government to at least make a reasoned response to recommendations made by coroners on safety to prevent future deaths? Louise Christian London N16 Flexible hours in the stone age Reading Sonia Sodha on working hours and the value of leisure time (“Covid has shown flexible working is a benefit only for the privileged few”, Comment) had me thinking of anthropologist Marshall Sahlins’s essay, The Original Affluent Society, published more than 50 years ago, in which he demonstrated that for most of history our hunter-gatherer ancestors devoted three hours a day to fulfilling their basic needs, leaving the rest of the time free for social and cultural activities. Other studies indicate that medieval peasants probably enjoyed more leisure time than those of us living in modern industrial societies. Will Douglas-Mann Petrockstowe, Devon Operation Mincemeat’s hero Given the resurgence of interest in Operation Mincemeat, now both a film and comedy musical (“War legend takes on a new identity for our times”, Focus), it feels important to be precise about the nature of the enterprise and its cultural representation. One of the most remarkable theatre works I have experienced was the 2009 production Mincemeat, by Cardboard Citizens’ Adrian Jackson and Farhana Sheikh. It focused notably on the homeless man – Glyndwr Michael – whose corpse made the venture possible. Despite his pivotal role, he was described by Ewen Montagu, who cooked up the plan, as “a bit of a ne’er-do-well”. History might be written by the victors but it’s important not to forget those whose bodies – literally – made that possible. Fully acknowledging those who came before us would surely make our “finest hour” something to revisit. Gareth Evans, Whitechapel Gallery London E8 Rethink Thought for the Day On behalf of what I suspect are a number of your readers who profess a faith, I welcome Catherine Bennett’s justified criticisms of recent contributions to Thought for the Day Radio 4’s Today programme (“I pray in vain for wisdom amid the platitudes of Thought for the Day”, Comment). A number have been frankly embarrassing and serve only to discredit a faith-based view of the world. Assuming that it has to continue to be broadcast, it is time that it was opened up to contributions from those who espouse a non-religious approach. This would more truly reflect the society in which we live, give voice to currently unrecognised insights and refresh a tired formula.

Asked about the impact of sanctions on Russia for consumers at home, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, told MPs on Wednesday he believed the public was “willing to endure hardships” in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. But many Conservative MPs are privately and publicly urging the chancellor to do more to soften the blow, and one source suggested Treasury officials were already drawing up possible policy options. Sunak’s February package of a £200 energy bill cut, to be paid back over five years, and a £150 council tax rebate had been criticised already as too meagre to cushion the blow significantly for many households. New analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests the impact of the war on energy prices means those measures may now protect consumers from just a fifth of the coming increase. “Living standards will suffer across the board,” they warn. The IFS calculates that providing the same level of protection as Sunak had planned would now cost an additional £12bn. Its director, Paul Johnson, said the chancellor must make a “huge judgment call”. “Will he do more to protect households from the effects of energy prices which have risen even further in the last two weeks? If he doesn’t then many on moderate incomes will face the biggest hit to their living standards since at least the financial crisis. If he does, then there will be another big hit to the public finances,” he said. Treasury sources rejected the idea of ditching the national insurance increase due to come into force in April and said the spring statement would be “policy-light”, but did not rule out Sunak taking further action on living standards. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, used prime minister’s questions to repeatedly link the cost of living crisis to the impact of the invasion of Ukraine. He called for more direct help to cut energy bills, including a windfall tax on oil companies, but also demanded urgent action to reduce reliance on hydrocarbons, including an end to a de facto ban on new onshore wind projects. Johnson dismissed the idea of a windfall tax, saying: “The net result of that would be to see the oil companies put their prices up yet higher, and make it more difficult for them to do what we need them to do … and that is divesting from dependence on Russian oil and gas. That is the way forward for this country – it is to take a sober, responsible approach.” Starmer responded with derision, saying: “I don’t think the prime minister understands the mess he’s in.” During a later statement by Kwarteng about phasing out Russian oil, Conservative MPs underlined the scale of the challenge, with the former housing secretary Robert Jenrick warning: “I think we have to brace ourselves for the greatest impact on living standards that any of us have known in our lifetimes.” Robert Halfon, the chair of the education select committee, pressed ministers to echo Ireland’s approach of cutting fuel duty. “We must, must do the same,” he said. “Prices at the pumps are reaching £1.60 per litre for hard-pressed motorists. They’re paying around £16 more than a year ago. Hauliers are paying more than £120 every time they fill up at the pumps, and this is literally unaffordable for many people.” The North East Bedfordshire MP, Richard Fuller, called on the government to do more to insulate homes in an effort to reduce energy demand. The former business secretary Andrea Leadsom told the Guardian no option should be ruled out – including a tax on the energy companies, which have been making record profits. “The chancellor will no doubt be looking carefully at further steps in addition to the energy support he has already put in place,” she said. “In such unprecedented times, every solution should be on the table – from an urgent focus on home insulation to rapid deployment of batteries to store wind and solar power and even to short-term ramping up of production in the North Sea basin and further taxes on big oil companies.” Sunak has been holding roundtables with backbench Conservative MPs to discuss ways to alleviate the impact of rising energy bills, though one attender said the chancellor had stressed the parlous state of the public finances. Speaking this month after giving a lecture at the London School of Economics, Sunak appeared to acknowledge that more might need to be done. He pointed out that part of the cost of living support package will continue to help consumers into the autumn, but added: “As ever part of my job is always to be listening to people and making sure the policies that we’ve got in place are the right ones to help the economy, to help families and people can judge me on my track record about how we do that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"plico-renewable-energy/2022/mar/07/save-your-energy-step-inside-these-beautiful-sustainably-designed-wa-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"plico-renewable-energy","sectionName":"Plico: Renewable energy","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-07T01:07:49Z","webTitle":"Save your energy: step inside these beautiful, sustainably designed WA homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/plico-renewable-energy/2022/mar/07/save-your-energy-step-inside-these-beautiful-sustainably-designed-wa-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/plico-renewable-energy/2022/mar/07/save-your-energy-step-inside-these-beautiful-sustainably-designed-wa-homes","fields":{"headline":"Save your energy: step inside these beautiful, sustainably designed WA homes","bodyText":"In the not-too-distant past, if you asked someone to think of a green home, they might have pictured a yurt, a mud-brick cottage, or some other alternative building, standing alone, on a remote, windswept patch of wilderness. Circa 2022, eco-homes are a far different prospect, with the best examples, often in urban settings, stylishly combining sustainable principles and razor-sharp design. Comprehensive green thinking, however, goes beyond just a blueprint. Thoughtful homeowners and architects take into account everything from building material choices (salvaged and seconds-grade bricks, timber, tiles and windows are popular among green thinkers and often have the added bonus of fascinating back stories) to the green credentials of the home appliances in which they’ll be investing (what is the environmental footprint of manufacturing this product, and is the company committed to ecologically sound practices?). More often than not, these green options offer significant long-term benefits, such as reduced heating or electricity costs that will repay initial investments many times over. Often, some of these solutions – such as using recycled building materials – will offer immediate financial benefits. Sustainably minded builders also explore alternative energy options; chiefly, the rapidly changing world of solar power. Investing in a solar battery system from a provider such as Plico is a fuss-free way for homes to not just generate their own energy and store it for use day and night, but to help safeguard homeowners from rising energy costs and ensure homes are being powered by the latest technology. In short, the green house of today is a holistic concept and the sustainably minded have countless ways to contribute to the discussion. Although here we will focus on one or two key features in each home, each of these houses ticks myriad boxes for sustainable thinking and living. Get ready to be inspired. Photograph: Instagram Litehus, Shenton Park Too often, mankind has tried to impose itself on the environment around it, but often the best results happen when humans work in tandem with their environment. Enter this bijou home - the name Litehus is Norwegian for “little house” - built on an infill block behind an existing home in Shenton Park. While this particular project is the result of some fortuitous circumstances (one of the couple that owns Litehus, Bekk Crombie, is an architect, and the property was bought by close friends of the Crombies, with a view to them building in the backyard), it reiterates the value of investing in an architect’s input on any building project. Equally important is considering what’s important for those who will call the building home, which, for the Crombie family, meant being close to the CBD and able to cycle rather than drive to work, and having space for a vegetable garden. The Nature-Inspired Eco House, Perth There are gardens, and then there’s the rooftop garden crowning this inspiring three-bedroom home. Planted with waterwise and native plant species, the building’s green roof is about more than just aesthetics: this micro-jungle also functions as a heat sink in its inner-city setting, helps purify the air and promotes and contributes to urban biodiversity. (A growing number of hotels and buildings in Perth’s CBD are also dabbling in rooftop gardens, likely inspired by Joost Bakker’s hugely influential eco-restaurant, Greenhouse.) The rest of the home further argues that green living and good taste go hand in hand. Reclaimed materials are seamlessly integrated into the look of the space, while thoughtfully chosen furniture (Gumtree finds, family hand-me-downs) reinforce the owner’s no-waste credo. Battle axe block house, North Perth What do you get when the architect behind Perth’s first five-star Green Star apartment designs his own home? A masterclass in transforming an urban block into a vision of modern, green living. Inspired by the courtyarded homes of the Mediterranean and North Africa, this two-storey home cleverly uses passive solar design principles to cool and heat the space (passive solar uses a building’s windows, walls and other structural features to manage hot and cold). An open floor plan plus strategically placed breeze blocks and sliding floor-to-ceiling windows means cross-breezes can be harnessed to cool the house during Perth’s blazing summers. The structure’s north-facing orientation – and top-floor terrace – makes the most of the winter sun. Macdonald Road house, Applecross Hidden behind painted gums and a feature veranda, this downsizer home manages to conjure a sense of privacy despite being near a shopping precinct and major roundabout. Like many environmentally minded dwellings, it has passive solar design elements that keep things cool in summer (the veranda, for example, features vertical batten screens that can be opened and closed to protect against the WA sun). During winter, an underfloor heating system warms the house from below, conjuring a radiant, ambient heat that’s more energy efficient than conventional heating systems.

Buoyed by oil commodity prices that soared following the turmoil caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, major fossil fuel businesses enjoyed a bonanza in the first quarter of the year, making $93.3bn in total profits. Shell made $9.1bn in profit from January to March, almost three times what it made in the same period last year, while Exxon raked in $8.8bn, also a near threefold increase on 2021. Chevron upped its profits to $6.5bn and BP reveled in its highest first-quarter profits in a decade, making $6.2bn. Coterra Energy, a Texas-based firm, had the largest relative windfall of the 28 companies, with a 449% increase in profits on last year, to $818m. The rocketing profits, at a time when inflation has surged in many countries, has prompted several of the companies to return billions of dollars to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends. Ben Van Beurden, chief executive of Shell, said that the company’s performance “has been helped by the macro and the macro has been impacted by the war in Ukraine”. He added that this situation means “we do have a better company, we do have a better performance, and yes indeed our shareholders will benefit from that as well”. Murray Auchincloss, BP’s chief financial officer, said in February: “Certainly, it’s possible that we’re getting more cash than we know what to do with.” Climate campaigners, however, have called the profits “obscene” and argued that the provision of fossil fuels would not be so lavishly rewarding if governments had acted properly to confront the escalating climate crisis. “The greed of these companies is staggering,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, an advocacy group. “We’ve heard their executives bragging about how much the agony of inflation and the tragedy of the war in Ukraine has allowed them to raise prices. These profits are going right into their pockets.” While the oil companies contend that they do not themselves set the global price of oil, the surge in profits is jarring given scientists’ warnings that the world should be rapidly phasing down its use of fossil fuels if it is to avoid unleashing catastrophic heatwaves, drought, sea level rise and other worsening consequences of the climate emergency. The wealth of the oil and gas industry also highlights how there is still far more money flowing from the destruction of a livable climate than there is from efforts to maintain it. The 28 large oil and gas companies made a combined $183.9bn in profits in 2021, a sum that dwarfs several major, but floundering, climate measures. Wealthy countries have promised, but so far failed to deliver, $100bn a year to developing nations to help them cope with climate impacts, while the largest piece of legislation in US history to combat the climate crisis, which would have cost about $55bn a year over the next decade, was scuttled due to opposition from Republicans and the pro-coal Democratic senator Joe Manchin. The International Energy Agency has said that there can be no new oil or gas fields, or coal mines, if the world is to reach net zero plant-heating emissions by 2050. Nearly two-thirds of all identified oil and gas reserves will have to stay in the ground to avoid the planet breaching a 1.5C temperature rise above pre-industrial times, a threshold beyond which will cause compounding disasters, according to scientists. A huge tranche of new “carbon bomb” oil and gas projects is in train from industry, however, that risks blowing apart international climate goals, to the dismay of high-profile advocates. “Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness,” António Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations, said in April. “Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels.” In the US, the mounting profits have irked Joe Biden, who has complained that gasoline costs faced by drivers have remained elevated despite a recent cooling off in oil prices. The president’s Democratic allies in Congress have proposed a new windfall tax for oil firms that would be used to send payments to Americans affected by rising cost of living expenses. “Never content to let a crisis go to waste, oil executives are taking advantage of the international situation by using their windfall profits to juice their own pay and pursue share buybacks,” said Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator who has spearheaded a bill that would impose the tax. “We should be clawing back big oil’s excessive profits and sending them to the Americans who paid exorbitant prices at the gas pump.” Most of the large oil companies now have their own climate goals, such as Exxon’s pledge in January to cut its own emissions to net zero by 2050. However, these promises are mostly centered on emissions coming from the operations of drilling and transporting oil and gas, rather than their actual use by consumers, which constitutes the lion’s share of pollution. Few companies are reporting on their investments in clean energy, such as wind or solar power, or efforts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Those firms that do cite these figures reveal that such climate-friendly investments are a very minor sideline, typically just a few percentage points of overall budgets. “We are seeing investment in these things but the levels aren’t meeting the science-based trajectory we need to be on to align with 1.5C,” said Simon Fischweicher, head of corporations and supply chains at CDP, a non-profit that helps companies disclose their environmental impact. CDP has estimated that the oil industry would have to invest three-quarters of its capital expenditure into low-carbon technologies if disastrous climate change is to be avoided. “There is a significant gap between what needs to happen and what is being promised,” said Fischweicher. “We haven’t seen the commitments in renewables that match the ambition required. I just haven’t seen any of these companies commit to net zero for the use of their products. There’s a lot more to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/31/how-will-next-uk-prime-minister-tackle-cost-of-living-and-environment-crises","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-31T11:56:47Z","webTitle":"How will next UK prime minister tackle cost of living and environment crises?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/31/how-will-next-uk-prime-minister-tackle-cost-of-living-and-environment-crises","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/31/how-will-next-uk-prime-minister-tackle-cost-of-living-and-environment-crises","fields":{"headline":"How will next UK prime minister tackle cost of living and environment crises?","bodyText":"The fourth Conservative prime minister in six years will take office next week, facing a set of inflationary economic and social crises not seen since the 1970s. Energy bills set to top £3,500 a year for the average household are forecast to push two-thirds into fuel poverty by January, while food prices have leapt at the fastest rate for more than a decade, adding nearly £500 and rising to the average annual grocery bill. Key workers are striking or mulling stoppages, and services from health to the courts are on the brink of collapse. Meanwhile, sewage is pouring into our rivers and beaches, a grim metaphor for the state of the nation taking tangible form. Voices on the right of the Tory party have been quick to seize on the overlapping crises to argue for the final burial of the “green agenda” identified with David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson, and the legally binding target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. David Frost, tipped for a senior role in a Liz Truss cabinet, has led a vigorous attack on net zero, blaming the policy for high energy prices, to applause from rightwing commentators. Get rid of the “green crap”, their argument runs, gas prices will fall, and ministers can concentrate on the really important stuff instead. Yet to row back on net zero would be to abandon the best hope of dealing with the cost of living, longstanding advisers have warned. Far from being to blame for the energy bills crisis, net zero – which requires energy to be used more efficiently and generated from clean sources – is the way out of it, they argue. John Gummer, a former Conservative environment minister and chair of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), said: “What we have to do for net zero is what we have to do for the cost of living crisis. When people say we can’t afford net zero, we frankly can’t afford not to go for net zero.” Ben Goldsmith, investor and a longstanding green Tory, chair of the Conservative Environment Network of more than 100 MPs, said: “With what’s happened on the cost of living across the board – gas, electricity, food, everything – we need to put the response to that on something of a war footing. And that means a war footing for the effort around energy efficiency and renewable energy.” Of the multiple pressing crises facing the incoming prime minister, at least three have strong environmental components. Soaring energy bills require an overhaul of the UK’s failing, gas-dependent energy system, from leaky homes to ageing nuclear reactors; the cost of living crisis is also fuelled by rising food prices, spotlighting farm policies; and the sewage scandal springs from failures over two decades to take the concerns of environmentalists seriously. Home insulation could cut heating bills by half, and heat pumps further reduce the UK’s reliance on expensive gas, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The rate of home insulation halved last year after the abandonment of the botched green homes grant. That scheme, launched by Johnson under the slogan “build back greener” from the Covid-19 shock, aimed to insulate 600,000 homes but was scrapped in March 2021 after it achieved only 15,000. Rishi Sunak as chancellor withdrew the expected green homes grant funding and it was not restored, leaving the UK without a nationwide scheme for home insulation for average households for nearly 18 months at a time of soaring energy prices. Sunak omitted to mention insulation in the early part of his campaign, but in recent weeks has begun to promise a programme for housing – but without detailing how it would work. Truss has largely avoided the topic, calling instead for an end to green levies, which she says would cut £153 from the average household energy bill, but would also cut the money available for retrofitting the poorest homes and put jobs at risk. Ramping up renewable energy would also bring down energy prices, but both candidates have set firm against solar power and new onshore windfarms, the cheapest form of electricity generation. Their motivation appears to be appeasing the right wing of Conservative members, for whom planning laws have long been a hot button issue, but poll after poll shows the public at large support the construction of new renewables. Gaining planning permission for solar farms is already hard – at least 23 have been blocked in the past 18 months, that could have reduced energy bills by £100m. Of renewable technologies, only offshore wind appears appealing to the candidates – as Truss recently boasted, the world’s biggest offshore windfarm is under construction off the Yorkshire coast. High energy prices will not be brought down by investments in North Sea oil and gas or fracking, despite both candidates’ enthusiasm for drilling. New gasfields take years, sometimes decades, to come onstream and fracking, even if it could overcome local opposition, is also unlikely to produce significant quantities of gas any time soon. Food prices are also driving up the cost of living. New trade barriers as a result of Brexit have caused a 6% increase in food prices in the UK, according to the London School of Economics, but neither candidate will admit that. Instead, any change of policy on food is likely to focus on trade and farm policy, and the danger is that the new prime minister could renege on reforms, begun under May and continued by Johnson, to replace farming subsidies based on the amount of land farmed with payments for measures that preserve soils, protect nature and nurture wildlife, a new system known as environmental land management contracts (Elms). That would be unwise, according to Goldsmith, whose brother Zac is the climate change minister, raised to the peerage by Johnson. (Zac is now an enthusiastic supporter of Liz Truss, but Ben has declared for neither candidate.) “Farmers need to trust Elms, and the government needs to stay on course,” he said. “We have to reward regenerative agriculture, restore nature, and rebut the suggestion that restoring nature and rebuilding soil will cost us in food security, when the exact opposite is true.” As well as the overriding issues of the cost of living crisis, the new prime minister will face a series of key decisions on green policy. Ministers have several times delayed any pronouncement on the proposed new coalmine in Cumbria, now set for November; Lord Deben was to step down from the CCC in September but will stay on until June, leaving the appointment of his successor to the new leader; and under the Environment Act, new standards for air quality should be set this autumn, in a key test of whether the government is serious about retaining environmental safeguards post-Brexit. Green campaigners fear that promises made during the campaign of a “bonfire of regulations” mean the opposite is true, and that vital protections for air, water, wildlife, and other aspects of the natural environment could be lost. Whether the new prime minister’s deregulatory zeal extends to demolishing the UK’s green protections depend to a large extent on the ministerial appointments they make to the cabinet, and within Downing Street. Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “The composition of No 10 is very important. If Truss comes in with a slimmed down No 10, or Lord Frost, that’s going to be very difficult. No 10 has been hugely important in driving the nature agenda up to now.” Domestic crises will preoccupy the new premier, but foreign policy concerns are also pressing. After hosting the landmark Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow last November, the UK will be expected to pull out all the diplomatic stops to try to hold together the fragile consensus forged there, amid the geopolitical upheavals that have followed the Ukraine invasion. Alok Sharma, the cabinet minister who led the Glasgow summit, threatened in an interview with the Guardian to resign if the new prime minister failed to commit to a strong green agenda. Many nations will also look to the UK for a leading role in biodiversity negotiations, called Cop15, aimed at halting the precipitous decline in species and the natural environment. “The UK has been a leader in allocating international funding for nature restoration in the poorest countries of the world,” says Ben Goldsmith. Yet Sunak as chancellor cut overseas aid and Truss as foreign minister slapped a more commercial focus on much of the remaining funds. Within Johnson’s cabinet, neither Sunak nor Truss showed much green inclination. Sunak blocked green spending, while as trade secretary, Truss downplayed environmental aims in trade deals and played little role in Cop26. “Neither is known for their passion for nature, and neither has made their name as an environmental leader,” said Goldsmith. Nor has either made the environment a major plank of policy in the campaign. Whoever wins will need to look much wider, and that is where green campaigners are pinning their hopes. Polls consistently show that voters do care about green issues, from the climate to the UK’s sewage-strewn beaches, dirty air and plastic-choked rivers. Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said: “These issues couldn’t be closer to home, there’s clear demand from voters wanting to see these things sorted and the next prime minister has to get a grip on them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/15/uk-must-spend-on-home-insulation-and-heat-pumps-ministers-told","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-15T06:00:44Z","webTitle":"UK must spend on home insulation and heat pumps, ministers told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/15/uk-must-spend-on-home-insulation-and-heat-pumps-ministers-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/15/uk-must-spend-on-home-insulation-and-heat-pumps-ministers-told","fields":{"headline":"UK must spend on home insulation and heat pumps, ministers told","bodyText":"The UK government must urgently bring forward billions of pounds in pledged spending on insulation and heat pumps, and reinstate the universal credit uplift to help poor households cope with soaring energy and food prices, civil society groups have told ministers. Vulnerable households are already facing stark choices between heating and eating, with hardship set to become even worse before next winter as rises in the cost of living bite, fuelled by the war in Ukraine. Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Save the Children and Age UK are among 33 civil society groups that have written to the prime minister, Boris Johnson, the chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak, and the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, to call for £3.6bn for insulation grants to all households, and an extra £4bn by 2025 to install heat pumps in place of gas boilers. The letter, seen by the Guardian, also called for benefits to be increased in line with April’s inflation rate, rather than the lower 3.1% planned, and for the £20 uplift in universal credit that was part of the Covid-19 response to be restored. The government promised in its 2019 election manifesto to spend more than £9bn on insulation and energy efficiency for British homes. Ministers are understood to be finalising plans over the coming days for a new energy security strategy that will boost renewables such as wind and solar power, and to pump more oil and gas from the North Sea, while the chancellor will unveil the spring statement, or “mini budget”, next Wednesday. But climate and poverty campaigners are concerned that measures that could provide rapid relief to poorer households, such as home insulation, will be sidelined as debate within government rages over projects such as fracking and new licences for the North Sea. Juliet Phillips, senior policy adviser at E3G, one of the groups behind the letter, said: “Green homes are the most obvious energy security solution no one is talking about. Energy security starts at home: this means supercharging a renovation wave to cut energy bills and permanently reduce the exposure of families to volatile international gas markets – boosting energy efficiency and rolling out electric heat pumps.” Fracking is unlikely to be viable on a large scale in the UK, and would not produce any gas for years. New exploration in the North Sea would also take years, if not decades, to produce gas. However, some Conservative backbenchers and sections of the media have called for them as a response to surging energy prices. Officials are also understood to have engaged in informal early-stage contacts with EDF, Drax and Uniper, which operate coal-fired or biomass power stations, about the possibility of delaying planned closures of coal-fired units, or increasing coal burning. However, the Guardian understands that this is a contingency plan that is unlikely to be necessary as the government believes electricity supplies in excess of those recommended by the National Grid have already been secured through its contracts for a different scheme. A government spokesperson said: “The UK remains committed to ending the use of coal power by 2024. We will be setting out plans to boost our long-term energy resilience and domestic supply shortly. The operation of UK coal plants is ultimately a commercial matter and we have made no formal request to EDF.” Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said insulation and support for vulnerable households were more effective ways of reducing Russia’s ability to weaponise energy prices. “This is a fossil fuel crisis, and new fossil fuels from the likes of fracking or new North Sea oil and gas aren’t going to solve our problems. We can reach true energy freedom and stand up to [Vladimir] Putin, but that needs the government to back properly funded measures to support households, accelerate renewables and properly fund home upgrades to reduce our use of gas altogether,” she said. Children were already feeling the impact of the sudden increases in the cost of living that have followed the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, campaigners said. Dan Paskins, director of UK impact at Save the Children UK, said: “Parents are telling us they’re struggling to meet basic needs, leaving them having to make impossible choices between heating their homes and buying clothes for their children, and children are paying the price. Without action, things are only going to get harder.” There is good evidence that insulation schemes work, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a thinktank, which has calculated that energy efficiency measures installed in the last decade save UK householders nearly £1.2bn a year. Those savings could have been much higher, but the rates of home upgrades dropped sharply after the government abandoned its flagship scheme in 2015. Heat pumps could also be rolled out far faster, according to Jan Rosenow, director at the Regulatory Assistance Project thinktank. He found that the UK could eliminate fossil fuel imports completely by increasing insulation and installing heat pumps in place of gas boilers.

It was shortly after lunchtime on 6 January 2020, when the president of Toyota, Akio Toyoda, took to the Las Vegas stage of the world’s most influential tech event. “Virtually every industry is trying to predict the future,” said the energetic leader of the Japanese car giant. Arms open, he wore a wide, diagonally striped tie and a precisely tailored, single-button, charcoal suit. “From my perspective, no one wants a crystal ball as much as the automobile industry. Everyone wants to know … when will cars truly drive themselves? When will they know what I’m thinking? When will they fly?” Toyota’s free-roaming e-Palette is a fully automated, battery electric vehicle. Toyoda wasn’t actually striding the CES 2020 stage to unveil a flying car. In some ways, however, his announcement was far more profound. The world’s biggest car company, Toyoda said, would build its own prototype city of the future – creating an entire community from the ground up, and building an infrastructure that would be connected, digital and sustainable. Toyota’s dream is to create a place where people can live, work, play and participate in a real-world living laboratory. Up to 2,000 people will reside there, including Toyota employees and their families. It will enable researchers, engineers and scientists from around the world to come together to test and develop new technologies, such as mobility as a service, robotics, connected smart homes and artificial intelligence. Dubbed Woven City, Toyota’s project has been designed by famed Danish architect Bjarke Ingels and is being constructed on a 71-hectare site (a former car factory) at the foot of Mount Fuji. Toyoda referred to Woven City as “a test track for a mobility company”, ensuring safety for the vehicles, the roads on which they’re being driven, and the people. “We didn’t think that safe autonomous driving is achievable unless you make a human-centered city and test it there,” he said. “That was the number one motivation behind deciding to build this Woven City.” Now well on the way to becoming a reality, Woven City is also a key part of Toyota’s strategy for achieving carbon neutrality. In December 2021, Toyoda said the global company would expand options for carbon-neutral vehicles by offering a full line-up of battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs). “Our goal is not only to reduce CO2 emissions and other negative impacts to zero,” he said. “Our goal goes beyond those.” Building on Toyota’s expertise with hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technology, plug-in hybrid (PHEV), and fuel-cell vehicles, Woven City will show how this might work day-to-day. It will be sustainably powered – largely by rooftop solar and the company’s groundbreaking hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) technology – and function as a sort of living lab. It will be a place where Toyota – in collaboration with other business partners – will test how a greener future will work for the people who live there. “With people, buildings and vehicles all connected and communicating with each other through data and sensors, we will be able to test connected AI technology in both the virtual and the physical realms,” Toyoda said. The city’s development will be intriguing. But its fundamentals are already a working blueprint for tomorrow, showing how everyday life will evolve. Toyota is merging battery power with autonomous vehicles, serving Woven City citizens with swarms of Toyota’s self-driving e-Palette BEVs. Revealed by Toyoda at CES 2018, Toyota’s free-roaming e-Palette is a “fully automated, next-generation battery-electric vehicle designed to be scalable and customisable”, the company says. Think of a transparent cube on wheels, of various sizes according to purpose, that zooms about, performing multiple “mobile retail” services: as a taxi; as mobile, come-to-you, dermatologist’s rooms; as a literal Thai chef-in-a-box who whips up your gaeng keow gai on the move; as a try-it-on shoe store on wheels. “Just think how good e-Palette would be at Burning Man,” Toyoda quipped at the time. That combination of electric and autonomous tech is well advanced – and has widespread buy-in. Even in 2018, Toyota had agreements to collaborate on its e-Palettes with delivery giants from Amazon to Uber to Pizza Hut. In the future, car ownership for personal transport will be unnecessary for some people, a change Toyota is staying ahead of. And one that will mean many public roadways can be repurposed – with fewer, high-speed, dedicated commuter autobahns, and more green and pedestrian space. Like the cars, our cities will have to embrace green power, probably in a more decentralised way. So vehicle-to-grid, or V2G, technology will be commonplace, supplanting any need to buy an independent battery for your home to stockpile solar energy for evening use. Instead, you’ll use the battery in your BEV to store power, charged throughout the day by rooftop panels. Even current BEVs will typically contain enough capacity to power an average home for a couple of days. (V2G capability has been mandated in Japan for years for BEVs and PHEVs; the technology is expected in Australia this year.) Woven City has been designed by famed Danish architect Bjarke Ingels and features wooden buildings and photovoltaic solar panels. Those houses will change, too, in composition, function and connectivity. To minimise their carbon footprint, Ingles – the architect behind 2 World Trade Centre, Denmark’s Lego House, and Google’s 97,000 sq metre campus in Sunnydale, California – sees future buildings, like those in Woven City, championing wooden construction. Rooftops will obviously be festooned in photovoltaic solar panels, but new materials mean that even transparent glass could transform the way buildings generate solar power. The inside of buildings at Woven City will be “equipped with the latest in human support technologies, such as in-home robotics to assist with daily living”, Toyota says. “Homes will use sensor-based AI to check occupants’ health, take care of basic needs and enhance daily life, creating an opportunity to deploy connected technology with integrity and trust, securely and positively.” To help that overall goal, and to give its pioneering work in sustainable propulsion the best chance to cut through, Toyota has also engaged in a royalty-free arrangement to share 24,000 electrification patents. It’s a remarkable piece of transparency that embodies Toyota’s ambitious attitude to change. Toyoda’s CES 2018 address wasn’t just about the e-Palette. Two years before his Woven City announcement, the company president and CEO, and great-grandson of its founder, also announced Toyota’s “once-in-a-century” plans to evolve from the world’s biggest automaker to something more progressive. One with a detailed global zero-emissions 2050 target, and a six-point outline to embrace overall sustainability in line with what will be required of all of us to reach climate targets. “It’s my goal to transition Toyota from an automobile company to a mobility company,” Toyoda said. “And the possibilities of what we can build, in my mind, are endless.” Decarbonised living, intuitive mobility, and houses that alert the hospital when you’re ill. If the machines must rise, that’s a transformation we may be grateful for.

Both energy sources are expected to feature in the next part of the EU’s “taxonomy for sustainable activities”, which is expected at the end of the year, following a period of intense political bargaining between the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen; the French president, Emmanuel Macron; and Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz. The EU taxonomy is a green classification system that is intended to guide investors to projects that are in line with Europe’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050 and better protection of nature. An EU official said gas and nuclear were likely to have “amber” status, meaning they would not be in the “green” category with wind and solar power, but would feature in the taxonomy. A senior EU diplomat said they expected to see nuclear in the text because “Von der Leyen seems to have promised it to Macron and the other nuclear states”. EU efforts will be closely watched by the UK, which is developing its own green taxonomy that the government says will “help clamp down on greenwashing – unsubstantiated or exaggerated claims that an investment is environmentally friendly”. The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through so-called delegated acts – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight. Since then, the project has been overshadowed by a fierce political row that culminated when EU leaders meeting in Brussels last week were forced to abandon plans for a joint statement on energy policy. France wants a stamp of approval for nuclear, while Poland and eastern European states insist gas is labelled a “sustainable” investment. Germany’s new Social Democrat chancellor is under pressure from his Green coalition partners not to give in to pressure to include nuclear or gas in the system. Scholz downplayed the taxonomy last week as “a tiny issue on a much broader topic”. However, the growing expectation of a Franco-German bargain that brings gas and nuclear into the taxonomy has triggered an excoriating response from Thunberg and nine fellow climate activists. In an article on the Euractiv website, the young activists accused EU leaders of making empty promises at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, which ended with a fragile hope of keeping alive a target to limit global heating to no more than 1.5C. “There is no space for cowardly decisions, like allowing for this fake climate action,” they wrote, citing the taxonomy. Bas Eickhout, a Dutch Green MEP and vice-chair of the European parliament’s environment committee, said there was no need for Von der Leyen to include gas and nuclear in the taxonomy. “We have a taxonomy that is now working, and green labels for green activities have been agreed,” he said, referring to the first taxonomy list covering renewables and other green investments signed off earlier this month. “We don’t need green labels for gas and nuclear.” Including gas in the taxonomy would be inconsistent with promises at Cop26 to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, Eickhout said. “If Europe now starts calling [gas] green then you can forget about the 1.5 degrees.” The European Commission is expected to publish the draft taxonomy on 31 December, allowing a few weeks of consultation with experts and governments. The final proposals may be published on 12 January and could only be blocked by a super-majority of EU member states – an outcome no one expects."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/05/qa-has-the-ipccs-bleak-warning-of-climate-breakdown-been-heard","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-05T10:00:21Z","webTitle":"Q&A: Has the IPCC’s bleak warning of climate breakdown been heard?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/05/qa-has-the-ipccs-bleak-warning-of-climate-breakdown-been-heard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/05/qa-has-the-ipccs-bleak-warning-of-climate-breakdown-been-heard","fields":{"headline":"Q&A: Has the IPCC’s bleak warning of climate breakdown been heard?","bodyText":"On Monday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the dangerous impacts of climate breakdown are already being felt and are accelerating rapidly. Has that message been heard? The second of four parts of the IPCC’s sixth assessment report, the latest comprehensive review of our knowledge of the climate crisis, was termed by some scientists “the bleakest warning yet”. Half of the world’s people are “highly vulnerable” to serious impacts from the climate crisis, a billion people in coastal areas face inundation, mass die-offs of species including trees and coral have already begun, and close to a tenth of the world’s farmland is set to become unsuitable for agriculture. By any standards, these are stark and brutal findings. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said: “I have seen many scientific reports in my time, but nothing like this. Today’s IPCC report is an atlas of human suffering, and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership.” But the report has been overshadowed, understandably, by the war in Ukraine, and has received less policymaker and media attention than it deserved. That does not mean the IPCC report will be ignored. Governments are working on their responses to the scientists’ warnings, and later this year at the next UN climate summit, Cop27, they are obliged to lay out their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Will Cop27 be affected by the war in Ukraine? Cop27 is to be held this November in Egypt, a country that has forged strong diplomatic and economic ties with Russia in the recent past. Any meetings among the G20 major economies will also take place under the shadow of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, insiders point out that the climate negotiations have gone on for 30 years, despite wars and other conflicts among UN nations. Climate diplomats are practised at keeping other geopolitical tensions at least partly at bay. Perhaps of even greater relevance to the climate crisis will be the decisions governments make on energy policy in response to the Ukraine war. This week, the International Energy Agency urged a suite of actions – from households turning down their thermostats by 1C to windfall taxes on energy companies and the rapid construction of new wind and solar power generation – that could reduce the EU’s reliance on Russian gas by a third or more. The other options open to policymakers if Vladimir Putin turns off gas supplies to Europe would include a return to coal-fired power generation, the dirtiest form of fossil fuel. The choices that governments make now, ahead of next winter, will have profound consequences for the climate crisis. What actions could and should governments take as a direct result of the IPCC report? One of the key messages of the IPCC working group 2 report is that climate change is already occurring, all over the world. Even if we succeed in limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C, the limit countries agreed to target at Cop26 in Glasgow last November, we will still face more extreme weather, droughts, floods, heatwaves and sea level rises. The IPCC made clear that countries must seek to adapt now to these changes, to stave off the worst damage. Adaptation can mean building seawalls and river barriers, planting trees on hillsides to stop landslips amid floods, conserving or regrowing mangrove swamps to absorb the impact of coastal storm surges, painting roofs white to reflect the sun’s heat, or making buildings and built infrastructure such as telecommunications networks, roads and railways more resilient to extreme weather. Far too little effort has gone into adaptation up to now, the IPCC found. Rich countries promised last year at Cop26 to double their funding for adaptation in the poor world, but nearly all countries are still badly prepared. Will adaptation be enough? No. There are “hard limits” to adaptation, the IPCC made clear: the impacts of temperatures rising unchecked would overcome all our efforts to adjust. Flood barriers may hold back a river in spate today, but as the icecaps and glaciers melt, as heatwaves take hold, and as droughts threaten agriculture, we will face too many threats and they will grow too severe for any adaptation effort to allow life to proceed as normal. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions urgently, to stop temperatures rising further, must still be the priority, according to the IPCC. How should that be done? Early next month, the IPCC will release the third part of its four-part assessment, by working group 3, covering “mitigation” – the ways in which countries can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes renewable energy generation, energy efficiency, alternatives to fossil fuels such as nuclear power, and novel technologies, such as carbon capture and storage and direct air capture of carbon dioxide. Working group 3 will set out pathways and policy choices governments could take to reach the goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C, including some of the likely costs and economic benefits of those choices. After that, a “synthesis report” drawing together all three parts of the IPCC’s sixth assessment will be published in October, for policymakers to discuss at Cop27."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jul/18/how-data-could-save-earth-from-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-07-18T12:00:29Z","webTitle":"How data could save Earth from climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/18/how-data-could-save-earth-from-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jul/18/how-data-could-save-earth-from-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"How data could save Earth from climate change","bodyText":"As monikers go, Subak may seem an odd choice for a new organisation that aims to accelerate hi-tech efforts to combat the climate crisis. The name is Indonesian, it transpires, and refers to an ancient agricultural system that allows farmers to co-ordinate their efforts when irrigating and growing crops. “Subak allows farmers to carefully synchronise their use of water and so maximise rice production,” said Bryony Worthington, founder and board member of the new, not-for-profit climate action group. “And that is exactly what we are going to do – with data. By sharing and channelling data, we can maximise our efforts to combat carbon emissions and global warming. Data is going to be the new water, in other words.” Subak will be officially launched on Monday and will select and fund non-profit groups, working around the world, to combat the climate crisis. Early start-ups already helped by Subak include one group that is assisting UK local authorities to boost electric car use, while another is using accurate weather forecasts to make best use of solar power across Britain and limit fossil fuel burning to generate electricity. These efforts are being launched after a week of headlines that have highlighted how perilous life on Earth is becoming as global heating grips the planet. Floods in Germany and Belgium left more than 150 dead; scientists revealed that the Brazilian rainforest now emits more carbon dioxide than it absorbs; and fires devastated vast tracts of Californian forests. In each case, scientists warned that rising temperatures – triggered by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere – are likely to have played a key role in bringing about these catastrophes. Urgent action is clearly needed, says Lady Worthington, a noted climate activist and lead author of the team which drafted the UK’s 2008 Climate Change Act, legislation that required the UK to reduce its carbon emissions by at least 80% of their 1990 levels. At the time, Worthington was working with Friends of the Earth but was seconded to government to help design the legislation. For her efforts, she was made a peer in 2010. Since then, Worthington has continued in the battle against the climate crisis, and in 2019 she read Harvard academic Shoshana Zuboff’s book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism ,which focuses – disapprovingly – on hi-tech companies’ growing use of personal data to make money. “It woke me up to the fact a whole new world of digital tools was being deployed to generate profits,” says Worthington. “I realised it would be better if those tools could be used to save the planet – to protect the global commons – and not merely to boost share value.” Worthington contacted Gi Fernando, a tech entrepreneur, and the pair hatched the idea of Subak, which has since been given funding by the Quadrature Climate Foundation (QCF) that was recently set up by the London investment management company, Quadrature Capital. Its aim is to provide initial funding to help groups establish themselves but also to give expert guidance over legal, management and other issues. “When you start up a company or group, you are quite alone,” says Fernando. “So if you have a community around you that can offer help – HR, finance, tools – that is incredibly helpful. And then, once that group gets on their feet, they can then start to help other startup entrepreneurs wanting to open new avenues in order to help fight climate change.” Fernando’s words are echoed by several of the groups that Subak has already helped to set up, such as Open Climate Fix. This aims to reduce carbon emissions by improving weather forecasts to make the best use of solar power plants – whose effectiveness is reduced when the weather is cloudy. “If we get very good data about forthcoming cloud cover, we will know exactly how much solar-generated electricity can be provided in the UK on a given day,” said Open Climate Fix’s co-founder, Jack Kelly. “That will mean we will not need to generate unnecessary electricity from other sources – in particular fossil fuel sources such as gas – because we have underestimated the solar power we will get that day. That will help to reduce carbon emissions.” Subak’s provision of engineers and software experts who have turned weather satellite images into cloud cover forecasts was a critical piece of assistance, added Kelly. A similar tale is told by Richard Allan of New AutoMotive, which is monitoring how electric cars are being taken up in communities across the UK. Factors include vehicle use, sales patterns and favourite types of cars and trucks. That data can be fed to local authorities to ensure charging stations, battery replacement services and other resources are provided to maximise take-up of electric cars. “Replacing petrol and diesel vehicles with electric versions as quickly as possible is going to be extremely important in reducing carbon emissions,” says Allan. “And data about take-up rates in communities will be vital in achieving that goal.” This view is endorsed by Worthington. “Just as a major corporation has lots of different companies under its control, Subak is going to help set up lots of new outfits, each aimed at boosting efforts to control climate change. “We are going to be the Diageo of climate protection, though we will not be co-ordinating drink production. We will be generating precious data about the climate.” Climate crisis in numbers 415: The number of parts per million of carbon dioxide that make up the atmosphere. Before the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700s, the global average amount of carbon dioxide was about 280ppm. Burning fossil fuels has since added a further 135ppm and if global energy demand continues to grow and is met mostly with fossil fuels, that figure could exceed 900ppm by 2100. 3.6mm: The estimated increase each year in sea level, according to measurements of tide gauges and satellite data. This is a result of human-induced warming of the planet. It is projected that the sea level will rise a further 40 to 80cm by 2100, although future ice sheet melt could make these values considerably higher. 43.1 billion: In 2019 that was the number of tons of carbon dioxide from human activities that were emitted into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that absorbs heat and release it gradually over time, like bricks in a fireplace after the fire goes out. Current increases in greenhouse gases have tipped the Earth’s energy budget out of balance, trapping additional heat and raising Earth’s average temperature. 28 trillion: The estimated numbers of tons of ice that our planet has lost between 1994 and 2017. Global warming has a particularly severe impact at higher latitudes and this has been most noticeable in the Arctic. Scientists worry that as ice melts, less solar radiation will be reflected back into space and temperatures will rise even faster. Ice loss will become increasingly severe as a result.

Ali Allawi, who is also the deputy prime minister of Iraq, has written in the Guardian to urge oil producers to pursue “an economic renewal focused on environmentally sound policies and technologies” that would include solar power and potentially nuclear reactors, and reduce their dependency on fossil fuel exports. Along with the executive director of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, he wrote: “To stand a chance of limiting the worst effects of climate change, the world needs to fundamentally change the way it produces and consumes energy, burning less coal, oil and natural gas … If oil revenues start to decline before producer countries have successfully diversified their economies, livelihoods will be lost and poverty rates will increase.” Ministers of the 13 Opec member states are scheduled to meet virtually on Wednesday to negotiate potential curbs to production, as oil prices waver. Opec had earlier agreed to boost production as economies recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic, but slowing markets have led some to suggest a halt to the increase. The US president, Joe Biden, controversially called for Opec to increase oil production further last month, to keep oil prices from rising and assist with the US economic recovery. His plea was rejected. The Guardian understands Wednesday’s Opec meeting may also discuss the climate crisis, in an unusual move for the fossil fuel producers, before vital UN climate talks called Cop26, scheduled for Glasgow in November. Allawi and Birol suggested current oil price volatility, driven by the pandemic, was only the beginning of problems for producers. The climate crisis will not only require a move away from oil, but will strike the Middle East and north Africa particularly badly, where rising temperatures are already causing severe problems. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) recent global roadmap to net zero by 2050 found that global demand for oil was likely to plunge from more than 90m barrels per day to fewer than 25m by 2050, resulting in a potential 85% drop in revenues for oil-producing economies. “In a region with one of the youngest and fastest-growing populations in the world, economic hardship and increasing unemployment risk creating broader unrest and instability,” Allawi and Birol wrote. An alternative to remaining tied to increasingly volatile oil prices would be to invest in renewables, especially solar power. “The energy sector could play a role here by making use of the region’s vast potential for producing and supplying clean energy,” they wrote. Iraq is a founder member of the cartel that includes many of the world’s biggest producers, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Nigeria and several other African oil-producing states. The Opec+ grouping also includes Russia and some smaller producers. Most have been hostile to calls for action on climate change, while some have been dismissive of climate science and Saudi Arabia, in particular, has frequently been obstructive to UN negotiations on global climate action. The IEA warned in May that for the world to stay within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the lower limit set out in the Paris agreement – to which all Opec members are signatories – then all new oil exploration must cease from this year. Asked about the findings, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the energy minister of Saudi Arabia, told reporters after an Opec meeting in June: “I would have to express my view that I believe it is a sequel of [the] La La Land movie … Why should I take it seriously?” In the past, Saudi ministers have flirted with climate action, for instance suggesting that the country could power itself with solar energy in future. But none have seriously suggested a policy to cease oil exports. However, some oil producers have taken a more dovish stance. Oman, which is no longer an Opec member, is pursuing hydrogen as a potential low-carbon fuel for the future. UAE is also working on hydrogen, and boosting renewables, and recently inaugurated a new nuclear plant. Egypt, Morocco and Jordan are among other countries in the region with sizeable renewable energy programmes. Birol, one of the world’s leading energy economists, told the Guardian: “More than at any point in history, fundamental changes to the economic model in resource-rich countries look unavoidable. Countries in the region have been making some efforts on the energy transition. There are promising initiatives [among oil producers], but as is the case for many other countries around the world, reaching net zero emissions will require much stronger actions and much greater international collaboration.” He added: “The IEA has been warning for many years that countries that rely heavily on oil and gas revenues need to move quickly to diversify their economies away from fossil fuels to keep pace with the transition to clean energy. The impact of Covid on the oil market last year gave us a fleeting image of what the region’s economies could look like in the future in a world where demand for oil and gas is structurally weaker – and where countries do not take serious measures to diversify their economies and increase their resilience.” On Wednesday oil prices fell slightly after analysts said they expected Opec to stick to its plan of gradually increasing oil production."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jun/20/chris-bowen-says-states-can-decide-how-to-provide-backup-energy-generation-but-must-meet-2030-target","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-20T03:51:34Z","webTitle":"Chris Bowen says states can decide how to provide backup energy generation but must meet 2030 target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/20/chris-bowen-says-states-can-decide-how-to-provide-backup-energy-generation-but-must-meet-2030-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jun/20/chris-bowen-says-states-can-decide-how-to-provide-backup-energy-generation-but-must-meet-2030-target","fields":{"headline":"Chris Bowen says states can decide how to provide backup energy generation but must meet 2030 target","bodyText":"The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, says the states will be able to implement a new capacity mechanism in the national electricity market in ways appropriate for their needs as long as the arrangements are consistent with the Albanese government’s 2030 emissions reduction target. Amid soaring energy prices, blackout threats in five states and the suspension of the wholesale electricity market, the Energy Security Board (ESB) has recommended that coal and gas plants be paid to have generation capacity available as the grid transitions to low-emissions alternatives. The ESB’s proposal could have been controversial with states that have argued any capacity mechanism must favour renewable technologies but Bowen said on Monday the states would have discretion to implement the backup generation “in a way which is suitable for their particular purposes and needs”. Bowen said the generation mix was different in different parts of the country, with Queensland having younger coal generation assets. “It’s appropriate that states can implement this in a way that is suitable for their needs, but it will be within that national framework and it will complement our emissions target,” he said. Bowen said settling the design of the capacity mechanism was necessary to ensure an orderly transition to firmed renewable energy, providing the national policy framework that had been missing under the Morrison government and then energy minister Angus Taylor. He said federal and state energy ministers had agreed to develop a cooperative roadmap for the transition to net zero emissions by 2050 and he said the agreement to provide stand-by generation from coal and gas would not disrupt Labor’s 2030 target, which is a 43% cut in emissions. New South Wales and Victoria are among the states that have welcomed proposed changes to the market to pay for future idle capacity to reduce blackout risks, but analysts predict there will be heated debates over the final design and necessity of a new market. The NSW energy minister, Matt Kean, said details of a capacity market, as outlined on Monday in a design paper by the ESB, appear to work “hand in glove” with the state’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap. “We have a legislated requirement to deliver capacity,” Kean said. “We’re very, very happy with our plans to ensure that we maintain system stability as we transition [off fossil fuels]. But obviously our preference was always for this to be driven by the national energy market.” The contentious parts of the ESB paper centre on whether consumers will end up paying to keep coal and gas-fired power plants operating, and how much they will pay. The national electricity market (NEM), which serves eastern states and South Australia, is now an “energy only” market, which does not formally reward spare capacity. The recent turmoil in the NEM, which included soaring power prices and shortage of supplies that prompted the suspension of the wholesale market, has provided an early test for the Albanese government and Bowen. A key element of the market design would be to allow individual jurisdictions the ability to set their own paths, including avoiding support for old coal plants. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said in Melbourne on Monday that a capacity market was “an insurance scheme into the energy system and that seems to me to be a bit of common sense”. “States will make their own decisions and what I will do as prime minister is to consult and work collaboratively with state and territory governments,” he said. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said the ESB paper’s design was “more technology agnostic than it might otherwise have been” because of insistence by states such as his that they would not be paying coal plants to extend their operations. “Let’s be clear about this,” Andrews said. “The future is about renewables, whether it is wind or solar or battery storage, particularly when it can firm up and turn into baseload synchronous energy.” Earlier, Victoria’s energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, welcomed the ESB’s design as confirming that her state’s approach would be able to proceed under the plans for a post-2025 market. “We have always been clear that a capacity market operating in Victoria would make payments to zero emissions technologies and not fossil fuels,” she said. Tennant Reed, a senior energy policy adviser to the AiGroup, said the last meeting of energy ministers during the Morrison government had agreed on the opt-out provisions for every jurisdiction. “How something would actually work in practice with a bunch of opt-outs, I don’t have my head around yet and I wouldn’t be surprised if nobody does,” he said. The challenge for the final design will be minimising the eventual cost to consumers of any capacity support scheme but also tailoring the plan so that it deals efficiently with long- and short-duration storage, Reed said. “We are going to need new flexible capacity to absorb the volume of renewables or the proportion of renewables that we can have,” he said. In rare shortfall events – such as when a lack of wind occurs at the same time as reduced solar power – costly assets such as gas-fired plants may be needed. But for daily minor shortfalls of supply when the sun sets and households turn on appliances – batteries and gas-peaking generators will be able to fill the gap. Either way, ageing and increasingly unreliable coal plants are unlikely to be the answer, Reed said. “Whether they’re formally included or not, it’s probably going to be mostly other assets that are the players.” The ESB hopes to have a final design decision agreed by next February. One reason for haste will be any extended debate could discourage new investment, at least for the short term, as developers wait to see what the new rules will be. That could be “a big handbrake on anyone committing to new projects in the near term”, Dylan McConnell, an energy expert at Melbourne University said. The ACT’s energy minister, Shane Rattenbury, said he did not believe paying additional money to coal and gas generators at this time was “in the best interests of the community or the environment”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “If we are to invest resources in developing the mechanism, and asking energy customers to pay for it, then let’s make sure we get good value for money and that the mechanism actually drives investment in the renewable technologies we need,” Rattenbury said, adding that if fossil fuel plants were not excluded then zero emissions should have the highest priority and receive a higher payment. In Queensland, a state which owns coal-fired power plants, the energy minister, Mick de Brenni, said any final proposal “must support the development of new renewable generation, pumped hydro and battery storage, and ultimately deliver lower prices and better reliability for Queenslanders”. The lead analyst for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, Johanna Bowyer, said a capacity market would be paid for by consumers via retailers and “could put upward pressure on electricity bills at a time when bills are rising in many states”. Payments that went to fossil fuel plants could “keep high emissions capacity in the system for longer, delaying the transition to a low emissions electricity system,” she said. One industry veteran who wasn’t authorised to speak publicly said paying existing generators a windfall capacity bonus was “a lose-lose proposition for customers”. “Most of the time consumers will be paying millions of dollars to generators for doing exactly what they were going to do anyway,” they said. “For the others, predominantly coal generators, consumers will be paying millions of dollars to enable them to pollute longer in the middle of a climate crisis. Either way, this is a terrible result. “An intelligent energy policy would focus on getting more new storage (and clean generation) into the market ASAP – not waiting until mid-2025 to do anything.” Ted O’Brien, the federal shadow energy minister, said “Labor doesn’t know what it’s doing, and households and businesses will pay the price”. “The Energy Security Board has delivered a wake-up call to the new Albanese government by rejecting energy minister Chris Bowen’s request for the capacity mechanism to favour new technologies at the expense of gas and coal,” he said. “Instead of trying to create a new climate war that pits technologies against each other, Labor needs to recognise that the answer lies in a balance of technologies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/mar/12/tories-russian-energy-cheap-green-insulating-homes-wind-solar-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-12T08:00:05Z","webTitle":"While the Tories dawdle over Russian gas, we have a £28bn plan to make energy cheap – and green  | Ed Miliband ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/12/tories-russian-energy-cheap-green-insulating-homes-wind-solar-boris-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/12/tories-russian-energy-cheap-green-insulating-homes-wind-solar-boris-johnson","fields":{"headline":"While the Tories dawdle over Russian gas, we have a £28bn plan to make energy cheap – and green","bodyText":"At this perilous moment, we are faced with three interlocking energy crises. An energy security crisis, with the invasion of Ukraine demonstrating to Europe that it must wean itself off Russian gas and oil, and quickly. A price crisis of soaring, sky-high bills. And the climate crisis, which the UN warned just last month is even more advanced and dangerous than we thought. Some will say we cannot confront all three together. There are voices on the right of politics already growing louder, saying it’s necessary to sacrifice or slow down our climate ambitions so we can lock in energy security. But they are profoundly wrong. Doubling down on fossil fuels, for example, through a fracking-style dash for gas which some on the Conservative benches are proposing, would be a disastrous response to each of these crises. For starters, what is the quickest way to get us off Russian gas and allow us control over our own energy supply? By pressing ahead with building the 649 onshore wind and solar projects that already have planning permission in the UK. They could come on stream within two years and would fully replace Russian gas imports, but are being held back by the de-facto moratorium imposed by the government in 2015, when it introduced draconian planning restrictions for new windfarms and cut onshore windfarms off from investment in renewables. Fracking would take at least a decade to arrive, as the prime minister was warned this week by his own business secretary, and the average time between new exploration and production in the North Sea is 28 years. It’s the same story on price. The lowest-cost fuels available are now wind and solar. Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices spiralling further, generating energy from gas was four times more expensive than new solar or wind. And because we operate in an integrated gas market, we pay the same price for gas from domestic sources as we do for imports. Of course, the North Sea will continue to play a role as we transition to net zero, but whatever the level of our domestic supply, it cannot be immune from international price shocks. Fracking was halted because it was considered too dangerous by Conservative ministers. And on climate, the case the UK made at Cop26 was that the world needed to get off fossil fuels. That is indeed the central challenge of net zero. The idea that reverting to business as usual is somehow consistent with tackling the climate crisis is therefore nonsense. There is only one way to meet all three crises of security, price and climate together: to not slow down on the drive towards zero carbon, but to turn the current saunter into a sprint. It is time to finally take seriously the Cinderella of this government’s energy policy, which is home insulation and energy efficiency – because the best way of reducing our demand for fossil fuels is to reduce energy demand overall. Upgrading the 19m cold, draughty British homes would cut energy bills by an average of £400 every year and our gas imports by 15%. But home insulation rates have plummeted over the past decade, and emissions from buildings are as high now as they were in 2015. We need to push further and faster on every form of renewables. Get rid of the moratorium on onshore wind. Reignite the push towards solar power that I started when I was the energy secretary, but which was stamped out by government policy in 2015. Embrace tidal power and hydrogen. Finally, nuclear power needs to play a supporting role in the energy mix. The independent Climate Change Committee says that new nuclear stations are needed to achieve our net zero targets. During my time as the energy secretary, I identified the potential sites for new nuclear plants, but 12 years on the government has not completed any new nuclear stations. We should set a clear deadline on financial close for Sizewell C. There is no mystery as to why the government has so comprehensively failed on energy efficiency: it is the product of piecemeal, outsourced and underfunded schemes. We simply cannot achieve energy efficiency and the rapid switch to heat pumps, for example, without substantial public investment. That investment – as everyone from the OBR to the IMF will tell you – is the responsible economic choice. It is why Labour has committed £6bn a year to energy efficiency over the next decade as part of our groundbreaking £28bn a year climate investment pledge. We don’t have time for more of the government’s ideologically driven failure, nor their failure to take on the deniers on their backbenches. They play the climate hokey-cokey and we end up with climate delay. Remember the onshore wind ban was put in by David Cameron in response to unhappy backbenchers. They were no doubt inspired by a guy called Boris Johnson, who said in 2013 that wind turbines wouldn’t “pull the skin off a rice pudding” and that fracking was a better answer. The same double-speak cannot be allowed to happen again on the false premise that a new dash for gas through fracking might answer today’s challenges. Fossil fuels are not the answer to a fossil fuel crisis. We need a clean energy sprint to tackle the climate crisis, the cost of living crisis, and our energy security crisis together. This is the route to national energy independence and sovereignty. Business as usual just won’t do. The safest route is to go big, go green, go bold and go fast.

Setting aside a longstanding rivalry, the planes took to the skies just after 8.50am – more than 600 days since the US travel ban was introduced – in what the bosses of the two airlines described as a “pivotal moment” for the battered industry. Both airlines have reported huge losses and laid off thousands of staff during 20 months of restricted travel. For both airlines, US markets constitute the biggest part of their business – almost 40% for BA, with six flights scheduled on Monday to New York JFK, while 10 of 21 Virgin flights taking off are for America. Speaking before the flight, the Virgin chief executive, Shai Weiss, described it as “a tipping point”. Vaccinated US visitors have been able to travel to Britain since the summer, when the UK lifted quarantine restrictions, but airlines are increasing their schedules and there are full planes this week for the first time. To underline the significance for anyone who missed it, the BA check-in at Heathrow Terminal 5, the cabins and even the air bridge from the gate to the plane were festooned with American flags. BA and Virgin used their most fuel-efficient models, A350s, after both airlines retired their famous 747 jumbos early as a cost-saving measure during the pandemic. BA flight 001 took off on the northern runway, with Virgin flight VS3 rising into the air exactly in parallel. The BA chief executive, Sean Doyle, told passengers over the tannoy: “This is a real moment of celebration. I know how much today means to you – some have not seen your loved ones for two years, others have not been able to do business.” He also told them that flight BA001 was powered by a blend of 35% sustainable aviation fuel [SAF] – the largest mix used yet on a commercial flight, while remaining emissions would be offset, via wind and solar power projects. “In the years ahead,” Doyle said, “we envisage all our long-haul flights will be powered by SAFs.” It was a reminder that aviation still has plenty of challenges ahead. For now, though, some optimism has returned. Friends and family were some of the first to book to fill planes this week, the airlines said, with planes across Virgin’s US departures 98%-full until Wednesday. Doyle said there had been significant bookings too from corporate customers and small businesses, dispelling the idea that business travel was dead. Bankers in particular had booked to fly back, boosting the revenues from premium cabins. But holidaymakers have also filled the front ends, according to the BA Holidays managing director, Claire Bentley: “People are upgrading, treating themselves.” City breaks had generally not been sought after during the pandemic, for those who did try to get away despite the testing requirements and travel restrictions, she said. The US east coast’s biggest city has long been its best seller, though, and is coming back fast: “New York is in a category of its own.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/jun/25/renewable-energy-breaks-uk-record-in-first-quarter-of-2020","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-25T13:01:58Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy breaks UK record in first quarter of 2020","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/25/renewable-energy-breaks-uk-record-in-first-quarter-of-2020","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/jun/25/renewable-energy-breaks-uk-record-in-first-quarter-of-2020","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy breaks UK record in first quarter of 2020","bodyText":"Renewable energy made up almost half of Britain’s electricity generation in the first three months of the year, with a surge in wind power helping to set a new record for clean energy. The government’s official data has revealed that renewable energy made up 47% of the UK’s electricity generation in the first three months of the year, smashing the previous quarterly record of 39% set last year. The government’s renewable energy data includes electricity from the UK’s windfarms, solar panels and hydro power plants as well as bioenergy generated by burning wood chips instead of coal. The “substantial increase” in the UK’s total renewable energy output was chiefly driven by a growth in electricity generated by solar panels and windfarms which climbed by more than a third over the last year, according to the government’s energy analysts. The report added that the start up of new windfarms combined with the UK’s unusually wet and windy weather at the start of the year – particularly storms Ciara, Dennis and Jorge – helped to generate record wind power generation. Offshore windfarms powered the largest increase in renewable energy in the first quarter of the year, climbing by 53% compared with the previous year, while onshore wind generation grew by a fifth. In total, wind power generated 30% of the UK’s electricity in the first quarter, beating the previous record of 22.3% set in the final months of 2019. Rebecca Williams, of Renewable UK, said the renewable energy industry’s records were bound to be broken again in the years ahead as the government worked on “a massive expansion of renewables as part of the UK’s green economic recovery”. Britain last week set a new coal-free record of more than two months for the first time since coal-fired power generation began during the Industrial Revolution, following a surge in renewable energy due to bright, breezy weather and low demand during the Covid-19 lockdown. Williams said the government’s record quarterly data showed the clean energy transition “written very large indeed” because the records had been set at the coldest time of year “when we need it most”. The rise of renewable energy combined with a steady supply of nuclear power, which made up about 15% of the UK generation mix, drove fossil fuel power plants to a new record low in the first quarter. Gas-fired power plants made up less than a third of UK generation in the first quarter compared with over 40% in the first months of 2019, and coal-fired power made up 3.8% of electricity generated in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/apr/24/got-your-visa-victorias-coastal-enclave-of-rye-is-holding-fast-to-its-barefoot-roots","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-23T20:00:03Z","webTitle":"‘Got your visa?’: Victoria’s coastal enclave of Rye is holding fast to its barefoot roots","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/24/got-your-visa-victorias-coastal-enclave-of-rye-is-holding-fast-to-its-barefoot-roots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/apr/24/got-your-visa-victorias-coastal-enclave-of-rye-is-holding-fast-to-its-barefoot-roots","fields":{"headline":"‘Got your visa?’: Victoria’s coastal enclave of Rye is holding fast to its barefoot roots","bodyText":"It’s a few hours from the Goldfields, where I live, to Rye, where my boyfriend Frank lives, but also a few decades. For a Brit like me, this coastal Victorian town is like wandering into the pages of Puberty Blues – and exactly how I imagined Australia to be, back before I actually moved here. Most of the Mornington Peninsula (or Ninch, to locals) might be undergoing one long facelift, but Rye – in particular the back beach area – is an enclave that has held fast to its wild and woolly roots. Tradies who moved here in the 1990s for the surfing lifestyle are now sitting on properties worth a million-plus, but most aren’t budging – and neither are their kids. Serving the area is one short retail strip, including a milk bar, a bottle shop and a surfboard shop. Dundas Street Milk Bar is an institution for its hot chips and gravy, but also for its resident one-legged seagull, Lefty. Inside, you can buy fishing bait (mainly for the benefit of co-owner Mark Watkins), Point Break merch and surf wax. They do sell Big M flavoured milk, but they’ve also gone progressive with Soy Boy. On a whiteboard there are printouts of the top surf months, the data Watkins has been collating for 20 years, and which causes many arguments among customers. “We all have an idea of when the surf’s good, and I would have said February, but it’s nowhere near the best,” Watkins says. The formidable surf breaks have names like Gumboots, Snatches, Head Injuries and Spooks. Watkins says few are secret these days, but some are too fickle for non-locals to master. And even he’s warned off if he strays from his usual territory. “There are a couple I go to, west of my spot, and in a jokey way I’ll get: ‘What are you doing here? Got your visa?’” he says. “If you’re a stranger, good luck.” There is some intense localism around here – diehards sport “3941” postcode tattoos, others “Rye or Die”. You might also spot the odd “Fuck off, touros” sign at beach tracks, but then localism isn’t confined to Rye. Frank points out he had a similar greeting written in surfboard wax on his car window once in Portland. There are seemingly so few coastal towns that haven’t had their barefoot culture diluted by gentrification, that those living in these pockets can get protective. “It’s not that easy to get to know people here,” Watkins admits. “I’ve seen people move in and then move back to Melbourne because, basically, if you don’t play golf, surf or fish, you’re going to struggle.” Watkins estimates seven out of 10 houses on his road are holiday homes, but he finds the new builds inoffensive. They’re not volume-builder constructions and they tend to be set back, concealed by the tea trees. Plus, the local tradies get to work on them. While a recent Guardian article detailed the huge rent hikes in the Mornington Peninsula, people I talk to here say their kids often move back in, or pile into open-door share houses, or build on one end of their parents’ block. For me, growing up in a boring satellite town of London, the goal was to leave home fast and never return. It was the same for Frank, growing up in Vermont in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs. But here, kids tend to boomerang back. Frank’s 20-year-old daughter, Stella, went to WA for two years and has noticed some subtle differences upon her return. “Every car on the road used to be a beaten-up tradie car,” she says. “Now you park at carry and there are $100,000 cars everywhere and wedding photo shoots.” I should explain “carry”. It’s a car park behind Rye Ocean Beach where locals often back up and cook snags. As 19-year-old pro skateboarder Zepp Heyes tells me, “It’s almost like if our generation didn’t have phones. No one says, ‘We’re going to carry’ – everyone just rocks up. If someone’s not at the carpark they’ll be at the Dundas Street Milk Bar.” Zepp moved to Noosa a few months ago, but he’s already returned to Rye twice; once for his dad Drew’s legendary Ninch Fest, a music festival in its sixth year that has a distinctly uncorporate vibe. “It’s a reunion party, the sickest time,” Zepp says. “My girlfriend had never experienced anything like it and she absolutely frothed it.” During lockdowns, the then-Mornington Peninsula Shire mayor Despi O’Connor petitioned for the region to be annexed from metropolitan Melbourne, but the pandemic barely affected socialising in Rye. With only one bar that’s deemed worth frequenting, and the city too far to bother, socialising instead centres around house-hopping and beach doofs. And it tends to be intergenerational. “It’s like we’re all the same age,” Zepp tells me. “Dad sends us a different song he’s discovered each week. We’ll be like, ‘That’s sick!’ and send him one back.” His dad adds, “We tend to put a lot of effort into our music and surfing and partying, because that’s the lifestyle we chose over career.” Heyes Sr, a glazier, bought his block in 1998. The house is an ever-morphing construction of recycled windows, pier timber and mosaic panels, with a water treatment plant and solar power system. “A lot of people are like-minded in that way,” he says. “We will always go to protests about the blowing up of the heads and so forth. You’re really conscious of your local environment, and the greater environment as well.” For some, though, Rye has become too mainstream. Amy Hackett first hitched here to surf in 1980, aged 15, when the demographic was largely Italian, but has moved to Phillip Island. Back then, she befriended the legendary surfers and surfboard shapers of the area – many immortalised on podcast Salt of the Peninsula – and joined the Peninsula Board Riders at a time when women’s surfing competitions were an afterthought. “There weren’t a lot of women surfing because it wasn’t accessible like now. It was raw,” she says. “In the water I became renowned for a drop-in because if I didn’t stake my place I’d be out the door.” Every girl has a surfboard these days, and she’s noticed the 80s and 90s fashions resurfacing. “It’s funny to see them embrace it like they’ve invented it; I crack up laughing,” she says. But the kids are all right. As Frank points out, with such a small friendship and dating pool, etiquette is vital. “Everyone parties hard down here, but inside that looseness there is an order,” he says. “The minute someone crosses a line here they get pulled up by young and old.” His 22-year-old son Luca lives at home at the moment, but has done stints working at the snow and in Byron Bay, and is soon off to Spain (all with mates from the Ninch), which Frank thinks is a good thing: “At least for a bit,” he says, “because it is a bit [of an] insular peninsula, and there’s a big wide world out there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/15/blow-to-fracking-in-england-as-only-five-of-138-mps-in-target-areas-voice-support","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-15T14:04:20Z","webTitle":"Blow to fracking in England as only five of 138 MPs in target areas voice support","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/15/blow-to-fracking-in-england-as-only-five-of-138-mps-in-target-areas-voice-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/15/blow-to-fracking-in-england-as-only-five-of-138-mps-in-target-areas-voice-support","fields":{"headline":"Blow to fracking in England as only five of 138 MPs in target areas voice support","bodyText":"The prospect of fracking in England has been dealt another blow as only a handful of MPs for constituencies with exploration licences support the measure in their area, the Guardian can reveal. When asked if they would support fracking in their constituencies, only five of the 138 MPs said they would. Forty one said they would be against it, while the rest did not reply, or declined to comment. Many of the areas where fracking could be a possibility are in the “red wall”, with Conservative MPs representing those seats perhaps aware that their position could be difficult come the next general election. One such MP, Alexander Stafford, won the 2019 election in Rother Valley, in South Yorkshire, a seat that had been Labour since it was created in 1918. He said he was “very much against” fracking in his area, adding: “It is yesterday’s technology and will not solve our cost problems. It will take far too long to roll out. We must wean ourselves off hydrocarbons – which leave us in hock to awful dictators like Putin, or at the mercy of fluctuating international energy prices.” At the other end of England, seats in largely Tory areas, including Surrey, Sussex and Dorset are covered by fracking licences. Mims Davies, employment minister and MP for Mid Sussex, was clear there was no local support for fracking in her constituency or other affected areas. She said: “I believe that shale gas exploration should only proceed with local support and as long as it is safe and environmentally responsible to the nearby communities. Alongside my own concerns about the potential impact of this type of drilling in special areas like Mid Sussex, I have previously written on behalf, and in support, of my deeply worried constituents in Cuckfield, regarding planning matters at a controversial site in the small village of Balcombe. This site is just outside of my constituency but in the Mid Sussex district.” Environmental campaigners expressed alarm last week when the government indicated it would look again at fracking, a controversial technique designed to recover gas and oil from shale rock. Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said “all options”, including fracking, would be considered before the energy strategy, expected in the coming days, was completed. This came after a group of backbench Conservative MPs, including members of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, lobbied for the government to change its stance on fracking, and last week hosted members of the shale gas industry in parliament. Steve Baker, a trustee of the climate sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation, told reporters: “Under the government’s plans, we will need vast quantities of gas even as renewables are ramped up. It is time for all of us to listen to facts, not scare stories. The shale gas industry needs a level playing field and an end to hysterical misinformation.” But he is unlikely to find support from colleagues in the areas covered by active onshore exploration licences, of which his constituency, Wycombe, is not one. Local communities have protested strongly and often successfully against past fracking attempts in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cheshire and Sussex. Their concerns included the climate crisis, earth tremors and high levels of HGV traffic – 50 a day at one proposed site, and fears of water, air and noise pollution. The problem of the disposal of contaminated water from wells has also been raised. Fracking is not only politically difficult. Experts say that it could also be almost impossible to produce enough energy to justify the environmental and climate damage. The areas being considered for fracking are those rich in shale rocks. The Bowland shale rocks, in northern England, were formed more than 300m years ago as sediments, and organic material was buried in an ocean basin. Tectonic activity since then has folded the rocks towards the UK’s east and west coasts, making them more accessible. But though this area contains shale gas, scientists say it will be very difficult to extract. The tectonic activity has left a complex geological situation, which makes the shales significantly harder to exploit than the simpler formations in the US. “We have the wrong kind of geology, small geological basins rather than vast tracts of identical geology,” said Prof Jon Gluyas, an energy specialist at Durham University. “We also have, to put it bluntly, the wrong kind of shale.” UK shales are rich in soft clays that do not support fractures well, unlike the “crispy” shale in the US. In southern England, the shale in the Weald basin is also of marine origin but formed between 200m and 145m years ago. The rocks could only produce shale oil, not gas, as they have not been buried deeply enough, and overall the British Geological Survey does not consider the basin a strong prospect. A firm figure for how much gas could be produced by fracking is unknown, and scores of wells would need to be drilled to find out. The best current estimate indicates about five years’ worth at the UK’s current usage, though some people in the industry cite a figure of 50 years. UK shale gas production would not be able to dent the global price of gas, even if thousands of wells were drilled over the next decade, and some would be likely to be exported. Most experts say increasing the energy efficiency of homes and producing more cheap wind and solar power are the fastest and most effective way to deal with the energy and climate crises. Third Energy, one the main companies that had pursued fracking, now has “absolutely no interest in fossil gas” and is targeting renewable energy and using its wells to test the burial of carbon dioxide. Another high-profile firm, Cuadrilla, will need to begin permanently sealing up its two wells in Lancashire this week to meet a legal deadline. “The inconvenient fact, like it or not, is that the UK has not discovered any good shale for onshore gas production,” said Prof Stuart Haszeldine, at the University of Edinburgh. A government spokesperson did not rule out resuming support for fracking. They said: “In light of Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine and rising global gas prices, it’s right we move away from dependence on Russian gas and increase our self-reliance in our energy security. We are considering all our options. We will set out an energy supply strategy which will supercharge our renewable energy and nuclear capacity as well as supporting our North Sea oil and gas industry.” The spokesperson said gas produced by the UK typically had a lower environmental footprint than imports of liquid natural gas from abroad."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2021/sep/10/how-breastplates-became-fashion-feminist-accessory","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-10T11:11:03Z","webTitle":"Cyborgs, not goddesses: how breastplates became fashion’s feminist accessory ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/sep/10/how-breastplates-became-fashion-feminist-accessory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2021/sep/10/how-breastplates-became-fashion-feminist-accessory","fields":{"headline":"Cyborgs, not goddesses: how breastplates became fashion’s feminist accessory ","bodyText":"The musician Lorde appeared on the cover of US Vogue this week wearing a Schiaparelli breastplate. Metallic flowers became a makeshift brassiere, while stems acted as a waistband. With the New Zealander having released a new album, Solar Power, about the transcendental capacity of nature, this piece of body jewellery seemed to say that her allegiances lie with the natural world. Perhaps it served as protection, too, against the artificiality of the urban environment, as well as against recent criticisms of her work. From Lorde to Cardi B, Bella Hadid and Gwyneth Paltrow, who wore one, by Tom Ford, on the cover of Harper’s Bazaar in February, the breastplate has become fashion’s most arresting feminist trend. In an era of constant online surveillance and criticism, it is a piece of armour in the literal sense, with an implicit reference to Joan of Arc. “At every turn, as women, we are now politically exposed and expected to fight around what kind of feminism we want to support,” says Angela McRobbie, a cultural theorist and commentator. “[The breastplate] reflects our current sense of being ‘embattled’ as women.” Last month, Cardi B wore a gold breastplate in the video for Lizzo’s track Rumors. It elevated her pregnant body, adding to the growing move towards destigmatisating pregnancy in popular culture. At Cannes in July, Bella Hadid wore a different gold breastplate, this one shaped like lungs, from the same Schiaparelli collection as Lorde’s. The look doubled as a piece of “look at me” red carpet mastery (“When I would look down, you could see everything, so it was very bizarre walking on to the carpet with a breeze in places you usually wouldn’t have a breeze,” she told Vogue), but also as a physical protection against the sea of photographers’ flashing bulbs. “It entices us to look at her chest, but then repels us when we realise it is a gilded lung with jewelled bronchioles,” says Andrew Groves, a professor of fashion design at the University of Westminster. “There is a contradiction at play here of soft, fragile objects being recast in hard, cold gold.” McRobbie interprets the tough, metallic nature of the body jewellery as a rejection of male expectations of women in the public eye. She sees a connection to A Cybord Manifesto, a 1985 essay by the US academic Donna Haraway. “I’d rather be a cyborg than a goddess,” Haraway wrote. The breastplate transcends gender differences and expectations. “It’s an escape from the normative body. The idea of Haraway’s cyborg was to radically denaturalise femininity and the female body,” says McRobbie. “In many ways, it offered a feminist defence of radical body modifications.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/nov/02/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-cop26-do-not-despair","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-02T19:11:10Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on China and COP26: do not despair | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/02/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-cop26-do-not-despair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/02/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-cop26-do-not-despair","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on China and Cop26: do not despair","bodyText":"Among the 120 or so world leaders gathered in Glasgow for the Cop26 climate crisis talks, there has been one very conspicuous absence: Xi Jinping, president of by far the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, responsible for more than a quarter of all emissions. Mr Xi’s decision to stay away is unsurprising; previously a frequent traveller, he has not left his country for 21 months, since the pandemic took hold. But the reduction of the Chinese leader’s contribution to a written statement, making no new commitments, has highlighted concern about Beijing’s recent decisions. The first is its announcement that it will build new coal-fired power plants, a response to extensive power cuts. Though experienced observers hope the medium-term impact will be less serious than it appears, it could imperil China’s pledge to peak carbon emissions in 2030. The second is its national plan on greenhouse gas emissions, revealed last Thursday. While better than the 2015 plan, it offers little progress on its already declared ambitions and falls well short of the action needed to ensure global heating does not exceed 1.5C. And in Glasgow, China has (like India and Russia) declined to sign up to the new 80-country pact to cut methane emissions, although it has joined the agreement to halt deforestation over the next decade. Its failings are, of course, far from unique. China’s carbon emissions per capita are still around half those of the US, and its historical emissions are far lower (though it is catching up fast). Even now, its emissions reflect its role as the world’s factory. Unlike some wealthy countries, it has taken consistent climate action. The US has seesawed, with Donald Trump pulling out of the Paris accord, but even with Joe Biden’s renewed commitment to the issue it has a very long way to go. China made its key pledges in advance of Cop26, promising to peak emissions by 2030 and to reach net zero by 2060, increasing total wind and solar power generation capacity to 1,200 gigawatts by 2030 to reach those goals. It has also pledged to end involvement in new coal-fired power stations overseas. Over recent years, it has gained a reputation (merited on renewables) for underpromising and overdelivering. And it has every reason to act. Devastating floods in Zhengzhou this summer will have added to long-term concerns about food security and the safety of prosperous, populous coastal cities. It has based its industrial strategy on the move to renewables, in terms of exports as well as a domestic shift. Its envoy Xie Zhenhua is a veteran of climate talks who has an established relationship with his US counterpart John Kerry and real clout at home – but not the authority to make new commitments without higher approval. China has also warned the US that cooperation cannot be separated from the wider environment of difficult bilateral relations. Its security concerns strengthen its desire to hang on to coal, which it produces domestically. The US and the EU are reportedly looking past China to save their climate strategy, to countries including South Africa and Indonesia. The real issue is less that China came to Glasgow without a new commitment, but that it is better at unilateral declarations than multilateral engagement. Doing it all on its own terms makes the global progress needed far harder to achieve. At Cop26, China could have positioned itself as a world leader. (Instead, India – the world’s third-largest carbon emitter – is getting the applause, with Narendra Modi, the prime minister, setting a net zero emissions target of 2070 and significant shorter-term commitments.) Meeting the 1.5C target is crucial. China can and must do more. It should seek to do it hand in hand with other nations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2022/jan/20/justin-bieber-olivia-rodrigo-and-the-wiggles-who-will-win-triple-js-hottest-100","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-19T16:30:12Z","webTitle":"From Justin Bieber to … the Wiggles?

What to expect from Triple J’s Hottest 100","bodyText":"Since its debut in 1993, the Triple J Hottest 100 has become a minor national obsession: the subject of intense scrutiny, widespread coverage and constant social media chatter. This year’s countdown – which will air on Australia’s youth broadcaster this Saturday – is no different: with a Justin Bieber and Kid Laroi collaboration tipped as a favourite to win, along with Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish, conversations about Triple J’s playlisting of mainstream pop music have been reignited – while last year’s firestorm over an allegedly ageist tweet from the station still looms in the minds of many. If you haven’t been paying much attention over the past 12 months, or need a refresher before tuning in, here’s a form guide to help you through Saturday’s countdown. The sure things There’s a pleasing – or, depending on who you ask, galling – consistency to the habits of Hottest 100 voters, despite the music that gets released each year. For example, Eilish, winner of the 2019 Hottest 100 with Bad Guy, put out an album last year, so you can expect its biggest single, title track Happier Than Ever, to appear somewhere in the upper echelons of the countdown. Transformative and vaguely novelty Like A Version covers tend to do well too – for instance, DMA’s cover of Cher’s Believe (No 6 in 2016), and Alex Lahey’s cover of My Chemical Romance’s Welcome to the Black Parade (No 83 in 2020) – so it won’t be a surprise if the Wiggles’ cover of Tame Impala’s Elephant works its way up there. The website 100 Warm Tunas, which analyses Hottest 100 voting data from social media posts, actually has the kids’ group tipped for No 1. And perennial Hottest 100 favourites like Gang of Youths, Rüfüs Du Sol, Ball Park Music and Dope Lemon each released a swag of singles in 2021 – so keep an ear out for each of them. The (not-so) underdogs Nearly a decade after Taylor Swift’s Shake It Off was banned from entry into the countdown, it would seem that Triple J’s purview has changed – a lot. This year, the Hottest 100 is expected to feature an onslaught of Swift-level pop megastars of the kind you’d ordinarily hear on commercial radio. Laroi and Bieber’s collaboration Stay is tipped to take out the countdown, with tracks by behemoth Rodrigo, e-girl queen Doja Cat, and Eilish not far behind. 100 Warm Tunas also includes tracks by Halsey, Peach PRC, Lil Nas X, Bruno Mars and Lizzo on its prediction list. It’s easy to balk at this pop invasion, but you could argue that the countdown has always favoured mainstream stars: many past winners – including Glass Animals, Eilish, Kendrick Lamar, Angus &amp; Julia Stone, Mumford &amp; Sons, Kings of Leon and Muse – were all already major-label stars with huge international fanbases when they topped their respective countdowns. Despite the alternative veneer, their cheques were still being drawn from the same well as Swift’s. There’s plenty to be said about whether Triple J’s centrist shift is a good or a bad thing but at the very least it’s sure to be an interesting countdown. And if Laroi, a Kamilaroi rapper, does take out the top spot, it’ll be a historic one, too: he’ll be the first First Nations musician to ever reach No 1. The maybes Lorde, who made the top 10 in 2013 and 2017, likely won’t crack it this year, after her long-awaited third album Solar Power arrived to an overwhelmingly tepid response. Hottest 100 staples Hilltop Hoods didn’t release anything last year, so they’ll be a notable absence too – as will Flume for the same reason, after featuring in the last two consecutive top fives, he won’t be going for the hat-trick; he didn’t drop last year either. The absence of these heavy hitters, though, means that there could be some room for someone who had a massive 2021 to sneak into the top 20 – like, say, Genesis Owusu or Amyl and the Sniffers, who each released superlative records in the past 12 months. The talking points In September last year, Triple J’s Twitter account – which posts in a meme-y, ironic tone – tweeted “did it hurt? when you aged out of the youth radio station”. Backlash ensued from a number of listeners and musicians, including Ainslie Wills, who said that she stopped receiving rotation on Triple J once she turned 30; music journalist and editor Poppy Reid, who pointed out that there was a broader systemic and gendered issue at play; and Jack Colwell, who said that he was once told by the station he was “too old” to be played. Although an undeniably bad look, it might not have been an altogether bad move for the station: it’s no secret that, while its national mandate is to serve 18- to 24-year-olds, its audience tends to skew a little older, and there’s a chance that this mildly scorched-earth post signalled a shift. Still, perhaps the countdown’s winner will be the true judge of where Triple J sits in 2022: with Laroi-stanning Gen Z, or Wiggles-nostalgist millennials. Triple J’s Hottest 100 will be broadcast from midday on Saturday 22 January"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2020/sep/03/french-pm-says-jobs-and-green-economy-at-heart-of-covid-recovery-plan-jean-castex-france","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-03T14:15:26Z","webTitle":"French PM says jobs and green economy at heart of Covid recovery plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/03/french-pm-says-jobs-and-green-economy-at-heart-of-covid-recovery-plan-jean-castex-france","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/sep/03/french-pm-says-jobs-and-green-economy-at-heart-of-covid-recovery-plan-jean-castex-france","fields":{"headline":"French PM says jobs and green economy at heart of Covid recovery plan","bodyText":"France’s prime minister has stressed the importance of getting the country back on its feet within 18 months and “transforming” the French economy with a green makeover as he unveiled a €100bn (£89bn) coronavirus recovery plan. Jean Castex outlined how France would spend its way out of the crisis, rather than create “social misery” through austerity measures, with a plan that had the environment, competitiveness and employment as its three pillars. He said a large chunk of the money would be used to revive French industry in strategic areas to make the country “sovereign and competitive” in essential sectors. Castex said unemployment was a major concern, adding that he hoped the financial injection would create 160,000 jobs in the next year and would avert an explosion in jobless when emergency financial help introduced at the height of the Covid-19 crisis came to an end. The plan, which is officially called Relaunch France, aims to return the strength of the French economy to its pre-coronavirus days. Castex reminded citizens that of the €100bn (£89bn), €40bn had come from the European Union recovery fund, and urged them to remember this when the money was spent. This sign of gratitude towards the bloc was reinforced by Clément Beaune, a junior minister for European affairs, who said the EU flag would feature alongside the French tricolor on each project financed under the plan. Covid-19 had caused “sudden and brutal recession” because France and other European countries had put people’s health before the economy, Castex said. But an emergency plan overseen by his predecessor, Édouard Philippe, had saved jobs and companies, he added. Going forward, Castex said the government preferred to “temporarily worsen” public debt; the alternative, he added, he was to push the country “into austerity and to allow unemployment, misery and human suffering explode”. One third of the €100bn will be used to make the economy greener, including investment in ecological transition, hydrogen and renewable energy, as well as the renovation of homes and buildings to make them more energy efficient. Another third will be dedicated to “rearming industry”, with reduction in taxes – namely the country’s contentious production tax – that will mainly benefit small and medium-sized businesses. The aim, Castex said, was to make the country competitive by returning strategic production in areas such as health, food and other essential industries, to France. The finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said France was just as capable of making its own products, such as electric car batteries, as importing them from China. The last third of the money is to be invested in “reinforcing social and territorial cohesion”. This included measures to tackle unemployment, particularly among the young, and support those on low incomes and in precarious situations as well as those “who feel abandoned” by the state. Local authorities will be given a total of €5.2bn, and hospitals and care homes would also receive injections of cash. Castex said the government wanted to fight poverty and wanted the “maximum of firms to benefit from this relaunch”. He insisted there would be no tax hikes for households or companies. Castex concluded by saying the government would be keeping a close eye on how the money was spent: “I am particularly attentive of the putting into action of this plan: the how is as important as the what. I will be personally involved in this.” He said there were three requirements on which the plan depended: consultation, the close following of its execution and the application of measures at a local level. “It’s an ambitious plan that is based on a number of different programmes. If we want it to have the desired effect in the time hoped, it has to be closely overseen,” he said. However, if the requirements were not met by particular protects, he said, “the money will be placed elsewhere”. Le Maire said there were no official conditions attached to the money, but companies would be expected to enter into the spirit of the plan in terms of introducing ecological measures and respecting gender equality in their businesses. “This is a plan for France, for the French. It will rise to the serious crisis we face and will above all allow us to better prepare for the challenges of the future. What I say to people is have confidence in this plan and above all have confidence in our country and its revival,” Castex added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"membership/2021/nov/01/optimism-for-cop26-we-must-win-the-climate-battle-and-we-absolutely-can","type":"article","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-01T07:00:02Z","webTitle":"Optimism for Cop26: we must win the climate battle – and we absolutely can","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2021/nov/01/optimism-for-cop26-we-must-win-the-climate-battle-and-we-absolutely-can","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/2021/nov/01/optimism-for-cop26-we-must-win-the-climate-battle-and-we-absolutely-can","fields":{"headline":"Optimism for Cop26: we must win the climate battle – and we absolutely can","bodyText":"I’ve been covering climate and the environment for 17 years – it’s astonishing to me that so many positive things are happening in response to the crisis. Of course, we should have been bringing down emissions much sooner, and lots of the things that should have happened didn’t. In particular, I’d point to energy efficiency, which we all thought would be a big win early on, and fossil fuel subsidies, which have not come down as fast as we would have hoped. But in general we are seeing positive trends. Coal, gas and other fossil fuels are mostly on the way out, and clean energy is rising and rising. Renewables are a key part of the solution to this crisis. We need to shift away from fossil fuel energy to clean forms of power, and we need to do so urgently. Thankfully, their use is growing massively around the world, and the cost of this renewable energy has come down far faster than anybody had anticipated: now, in most parts of the world, wind and solar power are as cheap as – or cheaper than – building coal-fired power plants, which is fantastic news. It means the cost barrier to renewables that existed in the past has largely gone away, and we can see the cost of renewable energy, electric vehicle technology, and battery storage falling further. These will be hugely important at Cop26. I spoke to Alok Sharma, the president of the summit, earlier this week, and one thing he is very anxious about is that Cop addresses the real economy. The messages cannot just be political and high level about global action, but how this plays out on the ground with real people. It’s vital that we don’t see this as an abstract problem, but that it translates into greener business and personal decisions. It really is essential that we hold businesses to account because they are holding the purse strings and they are the ones who make the world go round. We need to be vigilant against greenwashing, make sure we hold businesses to account on the targets, and ensure they are not wasting time with off-setting but making genuine reductions. The more businesses we have on board, the more successful the outcome is likely to be. What would success at Cop26 look like? For me, strong ambitions on emissions cuts, from all national governments, as well as at state and regional levels. Banks need to put their money where their mouths are too, in terms of green investments. There is hopefully going to be a deal on methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, and forests – we need to be planting more trees and restoring degraded land as a priority. The long-term goal of net zero by mid-century is key, and we need to see countries putting nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in place, which are stringent 2030 goals. We may fall a bit short, but narrowing the gap would still be a positive outcome. After all, the world doesn’t stop after Cop. But what we really do need is a plan. In my years reporting on this issue, I’ve seen so many triumphs and disasters. The bottom line on our struggle against climate catastrophe is this: we don’t have a choice but to win, and we absolutely can. There was a time when it seemed impossible to solve the problem of acid rain, but we did. It’s true that greater challenges lie ahead, and they will require action from the whole global economy, but we have the technology and the ingenuity. I have no time for people who say this is too expensive – if we don’t have a planet then we don’t have an economy.

Inside the Norwegian mine that also dries wood","bodyText":"A line of large blue skips full of chopped wood sit at the back of a site belonging to Norway’s biggest bitcoin mining operation, a 5,000 sq metre warehouse on the outskirts of Hønefoss, a small town 40 miles west of Oslo. Hot air is being pumped into the 12 skips through bendy corrugated pipes curling out from the warehouse. Despite the snow, it will take a few days for the logs to be dried out, after which a local lumberjack, grateful for the free service, will take them away for sale. The wood is being warmed by some of the so-called waste heat being emitted from thousands of stacked-high computer servers, known as miners, working away inside the warehouse. It is one of two such sites owned by the Norwegian company Kryptovault. The company expects its mining to account for just under 1% of the computing and process power in the global bitcoin network later this year. Bitcoin mining, the process of earning cryptocurrency by solving complex computational math puzzles and verifying transactions in the process, is famously energy-intensive. The latest calculation from Cambridge University’s bitcoin electricity consumption index suggests that as a result, the sector consumes more energy in a year than many countries, including Argentina, Pakistan and Poland. Heat is an inevitable waste byproduct. Despite noise from ventilation fans so loud that the company had to spend about £1.5m on insulation after complaints from neighbours, the hot areas in the Hønefoss warehouse can reach 55C. For many, at a time of rocketing energy prices, this may be further evidence of the unsustainability of a business that was recently described by Robert McCauley, a senior fellow at Boston University’s global development policy centre, as “worse than a Madoff-style Ponzi scheme”. The critics are certainly circling. Russia’s central bank has proposed outlawing all cryptocurrency operations in the country, and China has already done so. Swedish regulators have called for something similar in Europe. Norway’s regional development minister, Bjørn Arild Gram, told the Guardian his government was reviewing its options. “Although crypto-mining and its underlying technology might represent some possible benefits in the long run, it is difficult to justify the extensive use of renewable energy today,” Gram said. “The ministry of local government and regional development is currently reviewing potential policy measures in order to address the challenges related to extensive energy usage caused by crypto-mining.” But there is a fightback brewing in the sector, of which Kryptovault, which uses only renewable energy, is a part. This week, the billionaire Michael Novogratz, the owner of Galaxy Digital, a digital assets company that seeks to become “the Goldman Sachs of crypto”, launched a sustainability programme on energy use and social responsibility, saying the industry needed to tackle a “false narrative around it being bad for the environment”. It has been described by some critics as greenwashing, but within a world that has until now been less than transparent over its activities, preferring secrecy over sympathy, this was a shift. Kjetil Hove Pettersen, 39, Kryptovault’s chief executive, who founded the company with friends after deciding to turn a hobby into a business, said he also believed it was time for the sector to push back at the prevailing narrative. “If you look at the total energy cost, globally, for any given thing, it’s always going to be huge – I think we can always compare to that of a small European country,” he said. “That includes also traditional gold mining, which takes more than four times the amount of energy as bitcoin mining.” Advocates for bitcoin argue that it offers the opportunity to exchange value with someone instantly without using a third party such as a bank, without permission and virtually for free. They say it is being adopted at a faster rate than the internet in the 1990s, with El Salvador having become the first country to adopt it as legal tender, alongside the US dollar, in spite of misgivings from the International Monetary Fund. Pettersen said people wanted bitcoin, and mining operations provided economic returns through tax and employment. Mining is further said to offer a way for countries with excess renewable energy supply from hydro, wind or solar power at certain times and seasons to make value of it within their own borders and without transfer costs. Estimates of what proportion of the energy used in mining is renewable vary from 25% to 57%. “Mining is not polluting in itself,” said Pettersen. “If you are running coal to run mining then that’s another story, that’s what you don’t want. Mining should be done in more than places like Norway – and it can be a way to save trapped energy. For example, in northern Norway where there is excess, or in El Salvador where they are now using energy from volcanoes, setting up production when it wasn’t there before.” Kryptovault aims to have 15,000 miners at work by this autumn. Otto Him, 37 and Martin Mikalsen, 26, who manage the Hønefoss mine, have nicknamed one area between two huge walls, or pods, of 6,500 computers as “the cathedral”, in recognition of its awesome scale. The company is transitioning from older bitcoin miners to new ones shipped from China that are said to be three times more efficient. There will be plenty more waste heat to use. The company is in early talks to dry seaweed for a local firm. Pettersen says the narrative will change. “At some point, country after country will adopt bitcoin as legal tender and at some point it will be obvious that it is going to change the world,” he said. “Just as it became obvious that the internet was here to stay.” Top 10 countries for bitcoin mining activity 1) Kazakhstan 2) Russia 3) Ireland* 4) Germany* 5) Sweden 6) Norway 7) Iceland 8) UK 9) France 10) Georgia *Evidence of activity probably inflated owing to redirected IP addresses via the use of VPN or proxy services.

The power plants generating electricity in England, Scotland and Wales produced only 39g of carbon dioxide for every kilowatt-hour of electricity on Monday, according to National Grid’s electricity system operator, the lowest carbon intensity recorded since National Grid records began in 1935. The new low smashed the grid’s previous record of 46g on 24 May last year, during the country’s greenest ever month for electricity generation. On Easter Monday, wind turbines and solar farms generated 60% of all electricity as households enjoyed a bank holiday lunch. At the same time the UK’s nuclear reactors provided 16% of the electricity mix, meaning almost 80% of the grid was powered from low-carbon sources. The low-carbon power surge, combined with lower than average demand for electricity over the bank holiday, kept gas-fired power in Great Britain to 10% of the electricity mix and caused the “carbon intensity” of the electricity system to plummet to its lowest on record. The UK’s electricity emissions have fallen sharply over the last year owing to the slump in demand for electricity from office blocks, restaurants and hotels which have stood empty for much of the last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The electricity system operator said demand for electricity remained 5% lower than usual last month despite the gradual reopening of the economy, from around 20% below normal levels in April last year. Last month, wind and solar power made up 24% and 4% of the electricity mix respectively, while gas-fired power plants made up the bulk of Britain’s electricity at 39% of the electricity mix. The carbon intensity was 185g of CO2/kWh for March, but is expected to fall through the summer months as solar power plays a larger role in meeting the country’s electricity demand. Fintan Slye, a director at the system operator at National Grid, said the latest record was another example of how Britain’s energy system was transforming “at an astonishing rate” as the industry moves away from fossil fuels and begins to harness renewable energy sources. Over 2020 as a whole, carbon intensity fell to 181g of CO₂/kWh in part due to the collapse in demand for electricity during the coronavirus lockdowns. But under the UK’s climate targets the electricity system will need to cut its carbon intensity to around 50g of CO2/kWh in 2030, 10g of CO2/kWh in 2035, and 2g of CO2/kWh by 2050. “It’s an exciting time, and the progress we’re seeing with these records underlines the significant strides we’re taking towards our ambition of being able to operate the system carbon free by 2025,” Slye said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/aug/10/uks-green-economy-four-times-larger-than-manufacturing-sector-says-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-10T06:00:12Z","webTitle":"UK’s green economy nearly four times larger than manufacturing sector, says report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/10/uks-green-economy-four-times-larger-than-manufacturing-sector-says-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/aug/10/uks-green-economy-four-times-larger-than-manufacturing-sector-says-report","fields":{"headline":"UK’s green economy nearly four times larger than manufacturing sector, says report","bodyText":"The UK’s low carbon economy is now worth more than £200bn, almost four times the size of the country’s manufacturing sector, with growth expected to accelerate in the coming years, according to new analysis. Despite what experts say has been lacklustre and patchy support from central government, the analysis found more than 75,000 businesses from wind turbine manufacturers to recycling plants employ more than 1.2 million people in the green economy. Experts say the sector not only has the potential to help tackle the climate crisis but also create sustainable jobs and improve people’s quality of life – with cleaner transport, reduced air pollution and better insulated homes. But they warn that if the UK is to make the necessary rapid and fair transition to a low carbon economy, the government must mobilise all sections of society – from trade unions to local authorities, community groups to businesses – behind a “national programme of transformation”. Prof Patrick Devine-Wright, of Exeter University and a lead author with the IPCC, said: “We need everybody to pull together or we have no chance of meeting these ambitious targets and staving off what are going to be really, really damaging climate consequences.” He said in the coming years many day-to-day aspects of people’s lives would need to change, from the way homes are heated to how people get around town and cities, from what they eat to where they work. “We need nothing less than a societal process of transformation in place alongside this vision of new technology, devices and infrastructures,” said Devine-Wright. “Unless we connect all those dots up, I don’t think it is going to happen in the timescale that is required.” Today’s research shows that the low carbon sector is worth £205.7bn in the UK. Using a similar methodology, kMatrix found the manufacturing sector is worth £55.6bn and the construction sector is worth £132.9bn. Wind, wave and tidal, and solar power have all grown rapidly in recent years, according to the data, which shows that overall the low carbon sector grew by 7.4% during the financial year 2018/19 to 2019/20 and contracted by -9.0% during 2019/20 to 2020/21 but is expected to bounce back in the post-Covid recovery. Over the next week, the Guardian will highlight low carbon schemes and projects around the UK – from regenerative farmers to private recycling companies, via hydrogen jet fuel, net zero whisky, retrofitting builders, and hemp milk – showing how they are not only helping reduce emissions but also improving communities, creating jobs and improving living conditions. But the current ad hoc nature of the low carbon economy, with some sectors and regions racing ahead while others are being left behind, has raised fears that existing inequalities could be entrenched unless the government sets out a clear plan. Experts say trade unions, local authorities and communities must be given a direct role in the process, especially in areas that are dependent on high carbon industries, to ensure the move to a green economy is rapid and fair. Hannah Martin, of campaign group Green New Deal UK, said there was now “a rich tapestry of climate focused community activity” with “people coming together to build resilient communities that will be the blueprint for how we live in the future”. She highlighted a range of projects, from communal food gardens to regional home retrofit programmes. But she warned: “Change at the community level cannot be done in isolation from a holistic strategy at the speed and scale required from the central government, which must both provide the regulatory support and finance required for local communities to innovate and create responses to the climate crisis that are unique to their situation and experience. “ The UK government has been widely criticised for its failure to set out detailed policy proposals to meet its ambitious climate targets. Nick Molho, the executive director of Aldersgate Group, an alliance of business and policy leaders, said that for the net zero transition to deliver jobs to local communities across the UK, the Government’s upcoming net zero strategy should include close collaboration with local authorities and community groups. Molho called for a UK-wide body to “support the workforce as the UK economy moves to net zero emissions” backed by by local transition bodies – made up of local industry, government, unions, and educational sector representatives. “[They] could be tasked with carefully planning the changes needed in their areas to support a successful transition to net zero emissions,” he said. During the buildup to the key climate meeting in Glasgow later this year, ministers have faced widespread criticism for a string of failures that include trying to open a new coalmine, issuing new licences for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea, pushing ahead with a £27bn road-building plan, scrapping the green homes grant insulation programme, and cutting overseas aid. Last month, the government’s own climate advisers criticised the lack of policy detail, with the chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, Chris Stark, saying “progress was illusory”. Ed Miliband, who is heading Labour’s climate team, said that the failure of the government to grasp the challenge and opportunities offered by moving rapidly to a low carbon economy was holding back communities across the UK. “Tackling the climate emergency could transform our society and our economy, creating new jobs wherever people live, growing British industries and making our businesses more competitive,” the shadow business secretary said. “It could clean up our air, protect nature, ensure everyone has a warm home with affordable energy bills, and help to tackle the deep inequalities we face between our regions.” He said “there were lots of green shoots across the country” but argued this was thanks to “imaginative people, communities and businesses” rather than a comprehensive plan from central government. “To truly transform our economy, we need government to show leadership and bring forward a green investment plan equal to the scale of the emergency we face and the task of economic transformation.” The report, by analysts kMatrix Data Services, which produces annual assessments of the low carbon economy for businesses, academics and local authorities including the Greater London Authority, was based on 900 data sources from government, the private sector and academia. It used a different methodology to the Office for National Statistics annual assessment of the green economy, including supply chains and networks and includes a broader category of sectors from wind and solar power to geothermal and water and wastewater treatment. The report’s author, Sarah Howard, of kMatrix, said: “This data, by examining the full extent of the low carbon economy from the grassroots up, shows us just how important it already is for the UK economy and the progress already made. “It also illustrates the chains and networks of supply are present and scalable, enabling the significant growth required in the wider sector. What we need now is a comprehensive policy framework and the required rapid growth can be achieved.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/sep/09/the-guardian-view-on-fossil-fuels-a-very-long-way-to-go","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-09T17:58:22Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on fossil fuels: a very long way to go | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/09/the-guardian-view-on-fossil-fuels-a-very-long-way-to-go","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/09/the-guardian-view-on-fossil-fuels-a-very-long-way-to-go","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on fossil fuels: a very long way to go","bodyText":"The switching on of the world’s largest carbon capture and storage plant, in Iceland, is a glimmer of hope in a bleak climate landscape. The amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by this new machine will be tiny: 4,000 tonnes a year, which is equivalent to that produced by 870 cars. Still, the project brings a step closer the possibility that significant amounts of carbon dioxide could, one day, be removed from the atmosphere. The significant risks that such technological developments carry must be addressed head-on. The danger is that they are a displacement activity from the massive and necessary task of reducing and then eliminating emissions (with any residual emissions offset or, if carbon capture technologies are scaled up, removed). This distraction need not be deliberate, although fossil fuel producers have consistently undermined climate action by promoting the idea that technological solutions will eventually make calls to decarbonise obsolete. Whether false hope arises due to corporate misinformation or wishful thinking, it is essential not to be fooled into thinking that carbon capture technology or similar developments will save us – and thus that the status quo is safe. The opposite is true, as is shown by rising temperatures and alarming new analysis of the prospects facing the world’s biggest fossil fuel reserves, and the people and countries that depend on them. A new study, laying bare the gulf dividing the commitments made by governments in the Paris climate agreement from the coal, oil and gas industries’ plans, concludes that 97% of coal reserves in the US, Russia and former Soviet states must stay buried if the world is to stand a chance of limiting the increase in heating to 1.5C. The same goes for almost two-thirds of oil in the Middle East, while Arctic extraction must stop altogether. With just seven weeks until the Glasgow climate conference, at which governments must make a new round of emissions commitments, pressure is building on all those with the power to influence decisions. This week, the US government announced plans to produce 45% of the country’s electricity through solar power by 2050 – a massive increase on last year’s total of 3% (in the UK the figure was 4%). Last week, the Iraqi government made an unprecedented intervention, calling for oil-producing countries to move rapidly away from fossil fuel dependency and develop renewables as a replacement. Ali Allawi, Iraq’s deputy prime minister, wrote in the Guardian of the urgent need for international investment to support the development of green industries. The alternative, he warned, would be hardship and instability. The fast-falling cost of renewables sends a clear signal that there is a route to safety. So does the political momentum generated by younger generations of voters and activists who are full of fear for the future. But the role of technologies such as that being tested in Iceland, and new forms of nuclear energy, remain highly contested and unclear. The inescapable fact remains unchanged: fossil fuels will continue to heat up our planet for as long as we keep burning them. Net zero pledges are empty promises unless they are accompanied by binding commitments to stop."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2021/sep/20/bps-joint-solar-venture-lightsource-bp-to-more-than-double-expansion-by-2025","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-20T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"BP’s joint solar venture Lightsource BP to more than double expansion by 2025","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/20/bps-joint-solar-venture-lightsource-bp-to-more-than-double-expansion-by-2025","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/sep/20/bps-joint-solar-venture-lightsource-bp-to-more-than-double-expansion-by-2025","fields":{"headline":"BP’s joint solar venture Lightsource BP to more than double expansion by 2025","bodyText":"BP’s joint solar venture, Lightsource BP, will more than double its global expansion by 2025 after clinching a financing deal worth $1.8bn (£1.3bn) to develop enough solar farms to power the equivalent of 8.4m homes. The fast-growing operation had initially set a target to develop arrays of panels with a total capacity of 10 gigawatts by 2023, enough for almost 3.4m homes, but the fresh funds will be used to turbocharge its ambition to 25GW by 2025. It also plans to build an extra 9GW of solar farms exclusively for the oil corporation as part of BP’s plan to grow its renewable energy capacity 20 fold by the end of the decade. BP has set one of the most ambitious renewable energy goals for a major oil company as governments prepare to ramp up climate action. The current global gas market crunch has further strengthened the political resolve to reduce the reliance on gas. Solar power could help to cut the amount of gas used to run power plants during the summer months. It could also produce green hydrogen, which can be stored and used in place of gas throughout the year. Lightsource BP’s founder and chief executive, Nick Boyle, told the Guardian that the future of the solar industry would be driven by demand for green hydrogen – extracted from water using renewable electricity – to replace gas in power plants, factories and transport. “Hydrogen could be shipped around the world as an energy source, which essentially came from the sun but is captured as a gas, and burned the same way as historic hydrocarbons,” he said. Dev Sanyal, the head of BP’s low carbon business, described Lightsource BP’s $1.8bn solar boom as “a big acceleration for a company which has been leading the energy transition”. Lightsource was founded by Boyle in 2010. He agreed to sell BP a stake in the company seven years later – turning it into Lightsource BP – in the hope of growing its 1.6GW solar business more than six-fold by 2023. Sanyal said: “In the four years since we formed Lightsource BP, it has tripled its footprint and doubled its workforce. The speed and breadth of that expansion is testament to the power of this partnership.” The venture is expected to create over 500 new jobs within the company over the next four years and expand its global footprint across 15 countries. Sanyal, who will leave BP at the end of the year, said the work of Lightsource “plays into the strategy” of the oil company to invest in “high value” renewable energy projects. “Lightsource BP has developed more than 30 projects, which today have consistently delivered 8% to 10% returns. So when people ask if we really have the capability to deliver the returns we talk about, the answer couldn’t be clearer – yes, we can because we are,” Sanyal said. “And quite frankly we love it – because it works.” Boyle added: “Globally, renewable energy is shifting from a mindset of gigawatts to terawatts. Investments are being made by the billion, not the million. And big companies like Amazon, McDonald’s and eBay are switching to clean energy. This trend proves that renewables are mainstream and solar is playing a key role in addressing the climate crisis.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/nov/01/cop26-xi-jinping-china-president-sidesteps-videolink-written-statement","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-01T16:18:31Z","webTitle":"Xi Jinping makes no major climate pledges in written Cop26 address","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/cop26-xi-jinping-china-president-sidesteps-videolink-written-statement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/nov/01/cop26-xi-jinping-china-president-sidesteps-videolink-written-statement","fields":{"headline":"Xi Jinping makes no major climate pledges in written Cop26 address","bodyText":"China’s president, Xi Jinping, has called on developed countries to “provide support to help developing countries do better” in dealing with the climate crisis, in a written statement to the Cop26 climate conference that fails to make any new significant pledges. The Chinese leader also urged all parties to take stronger actions to “jointly tackle the climate challenge”, and said his country would “speed up the green and low-carbon energy transition, vigorously develop renewable energy, and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations”. China is the world’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, making it a key player at Cop26, the latest round of talks aimed at strengthening the fight against global heating, which began on Sunday. Despite this, Xi, who has not left China since 2020 amid the Covid pandemic, had not been expected to attend the conference in person. He was the only world leader so far to deliver remarks to the conference in written form, although another significant no-show – Russia’s Vladimir Putin – is expected to send a video message to a related UN conference on forestry and land use. “We have been very clear as hosts that we welcome everyone to participate, but it will be in-person,” said Britain’s UN ambassador, Barbara Woodward, last week. Xi’s message to Cop26 echoes his speech at the G20 summit in Rome over the weekend, in which he participated via video link. On Sunday night, he spoke to those there at length about the climate crisis, urging countries to “balance environmental protection and economic development, address climate change and safeguard people’s livelihood”, and saying that “major economies should strengthen cooperation in this regard”. “The G20 members should take the lead in promoting and applying advanced technologies, and developed countries should also earnestly fulfil their commitments to providing funds for developing countries,” he added. In updated pledges, China confirmed to the UN last week that it would bring its emissions to a peak before 2030 and cut them to net zero by 2060. It also promised to raise total wind and solar power generation capacity to 1,200 gigawatts by 2030 in order to reach its goals. However, climate watchers were hoping for new pledges to cap energy consumption and an earlier start to reducing the use of coal, currently scheduled to begin in 2026, adding to pressure on China from other world leaders to promise more. Last Tuesday, Macron asked Xi during a phone call to send the world a “decisive signal” on the climate emergency, according to the French presidency. Xi also spoke with Boris Johnson on Friday. A Chinese government statement said the two leaders spoke about topics ranging from bilateral ties to sustainability. Xi said Beijing would “do what it says” when it came to its green and low-carbon development. The statement added that he said China’s goals would mean a “broad and profound economic and societal change”, and that that would be done “step by step and [through] hard work”. Climate analysts quoted by the Reuters news agency said the latest arrangement could indicate that the world’s biggest CO2 producer “has already decided that it has no more concessions to offer at the UN Cop26 climate summit in Scotland after three major pledges since last year”. But Qin Yan, a lead analyst at Refinitiv financial analysis, said the domestic situation in China should not be ignored in understanding Xi’s decision to deliver the speech in a written format. “Complicated domestic politics ahead of the Communist party’s sixth plenum on 8-11 November in Beijing is definitely Xi’s focus now. It is crucial for him to continuing a third term at the congress next autumn. And the current energy crunch in China is complicating climate policy, too,” Qin said. She added that the choice of written statement was “also to show China’s top leadership cares about UN climate talks, but it is not its top priority”. “It looks like China prefers to leave more room for negotiations in bilateral talks rather than showing all the cards at the plenary. Look at what the EU and the US just did bilaterally over Trump-era tariffs on steel and aluminium this weekend.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"plico-renewable-energy/2021/dec/22/keen-to-switch-to-renewable-energy-but-not-sure-where-to-start","type":"article","sectionId":"plico-renewable-energy","sectionName":"Plico: Renewable energy","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-21T20:58:18Z","webTitle":"Keen to switch to renewable energy but not sure where to start?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/plico-renewable-energy/2021/dec/22/keen-to-switch-to-renewable-energy-but-not-sure-where-to-start","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/plico-renewable-energy/2021/dec/22/keen-to-switch-to-renewable-energy-but-not-sure-where-to-start","fields":{"headline":"Keen to switch to renewable energy but not sure where to start?","bodyText":"Households are among the biggest drains on Australia’s electricity grid, making up about 10% of our national energy consumption. For a greener future, we all need to reduce our home energy use. The best way to make a big impact is by switching to renewable energy. But what exactly does that entail? Renewable energy is created from resources such as solar, wind and hydro. Unlike the traditional power source of coal, which creates greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change, when it is burned to produce electricity, renewable sources are environmentally friendly. It’s power that doesn’t hurt the planet. Making the move to a greener lifestyle - including adopting renewable energy - doesn’t have to feel overwhelming. Here’s a simple guide to getting started on your clean energy journey. Invest in eco solutions If you own your home, there are a couple of powerful changes you can make. An easy but effective measure is installing an energy monitor to track your electricity usage. You’ll be able to keep an eye on how much you’re using and rein things in if usage is getting a little high. Some models will even identify which specific appliances are draining your power. If you have a smart meter, it only takes a few minutes to set up energy monitoring. If you have a traditional meter will need to call in the electrician for what should be a pretty simple job. The more you know about your energy consumption, the better you can manage it. You could also look at insulating your home, if you haven’t already. Insulation helps keep your home at a comfortable natural temperature, meaning you’ll use less heating and cooling. In fact, it can cut home electricity use by up to 45%. Reduce your use The greenest energy is the energy you don’t use. An essential step towards creating an eco-friendlier home is cutting back on your electricity consumption. There are a few simple ways to reduce your energy use. One is washing your clothes using cold water. About 90% of the power used by our washing machines goes towards heating the water, so you’ll cut back massively on your energy consumption by ditching the heat. As a bonus, your clothes will last longer - hot water washes cause colours to fade faster. Other ideas include switching off appliances at the wall (items such as games consoles and televisions can consume electricity even when they’re not being used) and using LED light bulbs, which are more energy efficient than old incandescent or halogen globes. You could also consider adjusting the thermostat, as our heating and cooling devices are notorious for guzzling power. You don’t have to turn them off, just tweak the temperature - even a one-degree difference can make a big difference to the amount of electricity you use. Get with a green provider Your next step could be switching over to an electricity company that provides an eco-friendlier product. There are two main ways to tackle this. The first is to go with a retailer that offers a GreenPower, a federal government-accredited scheme that invests in renewable energy. GreenPower essentially allows consumers to opt in to pay extra on top of their power bills to financially support the development of wind turbines, hydroelectric stations and solar farms. It doesn’t mean the energy you use in your home will be from renewable sources - the grid is supplied by both renewable sources and coal-fired plants and you can’t choose what you get - but it does mean that you are supporting the production of more renewable power. Of course, opting to go with GreenPower will add to the cost of your bills, sometimes quite substantially. You could also do your own research into the more environmentally friendly power providers (keeping in mind that none are perfect - some are just better than others). An easy way to do this is by reading the Green Electricity Guide, a review and ranking of Australia’s electricity providers published by Greenpeace. An updated version of Australia’s guide will arrive in early 2022. Or better yet, invest in your own system To ensure at least some of the electricity you use at home is renewable, you can install solar panels. With your own renewable energy source ready to go, you’ll reduce your reliance on the electricity grid. Going beyond panels, you could also install a battery that stores the sun’s energy during the day for you to use when the sun goes down, so that you don’t have to tap into the grid after dark. This has the added bonus of taking pressure off the grid, as it stabilises energy supply and demand. With Plico, going green doesn’t come with big upfront costs. Plico makes solar power available on a subscription model, meaning you pay a weekly fee, starting at $36.90. This includes 10 years of servicing and maintenance on your solar system. Plico also monitors performance to make sure things are running optimally. It’s a model that enables all homeowners to reduce their footprint; bigger households can save money in the long term, too. A solar + battery system can be the best green power solution of all.

The 50 sq metres of non-slip solar panels, installed in a small park in the Glòries area of the city, will generate 7,560kWh a year, enough to supply three households. The city has contributed €30,000 (£26,000) towards the cost, the remainder being met by the manufacturer, Platio Solar. The viability of the scheme will be assessed after six months. “We’ll have to assess the wear and tear because obviously it’s not the same as putting panels on a roof, although they are highly resistant,” says Eloi Badia, who is responsible for climate emergency and ecological transition at Barcelona city council. “As for cost benefits, with a pilot scheme like this it’s difficult to know yet how much cheaper it would be if it were scaled up. We’re keen to install more on roofs and, if this scheme is successful, on the ground, to power lighting and other public facilities.” However, he points out that Barcelona’s high population density means it would be difficult to generate enough electricity within the city limits to become self-sufficient. “If we’re going to reach a target of zero emissions, we’re going to have to think about supplying electricity to blocks of flats, but we’ll also have to think of using wind and solar parks outside the city,” Badia says. “But installations on the ground like this open up new possibilities, and not just for Barcelona.” The Barcelona scheme follows the installation of a 25-metre stretch of solar cycle lane in the Dutch city of Utrecht last year. The electricity generated is used to power lighting and also heat the path in winter to prevent it from icing over. Most of Spain’s solar power comes from large farms in remote areas where land is cheap but which are a long way from centres of population. The move now is to increase capacity close to where it’s most needed, in cities. “What we need to focus on is green policies to create employment, specifically to install solar panels on 1m rooftops,” says Fernando Prieto, executive director of the independent think tank Sustainability Observatory. “This would take five years, generate enough electricity for 7.5 million people, create over 15,000 jobs and cut CO2 emissions by 4.2m tonnes.” He adds that it would lower the price of electricity and help citizens to become independent of the few power companies that dominate the industry. “However, instead of this simple project, we are building installations of over 1,000 hectares on agricultural land and woodland, often with a negative impact on the environment,” Prieto says. Under the previous conservative government solar installation came to an abrupt halt after punitive taxes were introduced. In 2018, the incoming socialist coalition scrapped the tax, triggering a boom in solar, with Spain now ranked 11th in the world for solar power and eighth for renewables overall. Major retailers have got in on the act and now firms such as Ikea, electronics giant Media Markt and the department store El Corte Inglés are offering domestic solar installations at an average cost of €5,000 for a three-bedroom house. Meanwhile, the government has announced plans to invest €1.5bn of EU Covid-recovery funds in the production of “green” hydrogen, using renewable energy to break up water molecules and release the hydrogen. Spain’s energy companies have said they will raise this to €8.3bn by 2030. • This article was amended on 30 April 2021. An earlier version referred to 7,560kW a year, when kWh was intended.

Converting all home appliances and cars to run on electricity could eliminate a third of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions while saving households $40bn a year by 2028, according to a new report. The report, Castles and Cars, by the new energy thinktank Rewiring Australia, found the average Australian household uses 102kWh of energy a day at a cost of $5,248 a year. Much of this cost comes from relying on petrol and gas to power cars, stoves, showers and heaters. The report said internal combustion engines in cars were only 30% efficient in converting petrol or diesel to power, while water heaters relying on natural gas used three times as much energy as those using a heat pump – the same technology that runs refrigerators and air conditions. In electricity generation, many coal plants reach an efficiency of only 30% while natural gas plants reach 45% efficiency. Replacing fossil fuel appliances and vehicles with electric models by 2030, and powering them with increasingly efficient cheap solar energy, could save households $5,443 a year and cut household emissions to zero, the report states. It said Australia was uniquely positioned to electrify households due to its population density, capacity for renewable energy generation and existing state and territory policies. Saul Griffith, an Australian who has advised the Biden administration on energy policy and the report’s author, said taking the best existing policies from each state and combining them with federal leadership would allow Australia to put together a comprehensive framework and “show the world how it’s done”. “Australia is a lot closer to doing this than the general country thinks,” Griffith said. “If we go first, we’ll be selling those technologies to California. If we don’t go first they’ll be selling them to us.” He said the first step would be a pilot program to retrofit every building in a suburb. It would become a template that could be refined before being rolled out elsewhere. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report, developed in partnership with the Australia Institute, will be launched on Tuesday by Victoria’s energy and climate change minister, Lily D’Ambrosio. Matt Kean, the New South Wales energy and environment minister, who is expected to soon become treasurer, was due to join the launch before Gladys Berejiklian resigned as NSW premier on Friday. Richie Merzian, from the Australia Institute, said the report was a good news story. “It reduces the solutions to climate change to a simple narrative: get to 100% clean energy, electrify everything and then turn your carbon sources into carbon sinks,” he said. Suggestions in the report included offering rebates and finance to help low-income households switch to electricity and ensure access to solar power and battery storage as a “national priority”. It would involve programs similar to the Victorian government’s solar homes program – which aims to electrify appliances in low-income households – being expanded nationally. D’Ambrosio said the Victorian government was developing a “gas substitution roadmap” that would “chart a long-term plan to decarbonise gas usage”. “Electrification offers incredible opportunities to help us reach Victoria’s target of halving emissions by 2030,” she said. Nicky Ison, energy transition manager with WWF Australia, was not involved with the report but said it was “incredibly compelling”. “One of the problems we have when we talk about climate change and the energy transition is a lot of the focus 15-years-ago was about personal sacrifice,” Ison said. “We’ve now moved from a climate narrative based on austerity to one based on abundance and opportunity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/oct/22/record-renewables-drive-down-electricity-prices-across-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-22T00:07:37Z","webTitle":"Record levels of renewable energy drive down electricity prices across Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/oct/22/record-renewables-drive-down-electricity-prices-across-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/oct/22/record-renewables-drive-down-electricity-prices-across-australia","fields":{"headline":"Record levels of renewable energy drive down electricity prices across Australia","bodyText":"Record levels of renewable energy drove down electricity prices across Australia in the September quarter, with prices zero or negative for one-sixth of the time, the Australian Energy Market Operator has said in its latest report. There was also little sign of the Morrison government’s much-touted “gas-led recovery”, with a supply disruption at Victoria’s Longford gas plant initially leading to record or near-record spot prices for the fossil fuel in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne. Gas’s share of the power mix also slumped one-fifth from a year earlier for the quarter as a whole. By August the arrival of milder weather and ongoing weak electricity demand caused by Covid-related lockdowns in Victoria and New South Wales sent gas and electricity prices plunging, Aemo said. For the quarter, electricity from wind, solar and hydro plants supplied almost a third of demand in the national electricity market, at a record 31.7%. For one 30-minute period on 24 September, renewables met 61.4% of demand – also a fresh high. The share of black coal in the electricity mix fell below half for the first time for a September quarter, while the share of gas also retreated from a year earlier. The electricity industry has been decarbonising much faster than other parts of the economy. While still contributing about one-third of Australia’s carbon emissions, the power sector has been the main reason Australia’s Paris agreement climate pledge to cut 2005-level emissions by 26% to 28% for 2030 is likely to be exceeded. Aemo’s chief markets officer, Violette Mouchaileh, said power prices in the mainland section of the national electricity market – serving about three-quarters of Australia’s population – averaged $111 a megawatt hour in July before sinking to an average $37MWh by September. “This trend of falling prices through the quarter was in sharp contrast to international energy prices for LNG and coal which continued to rise throughout the quarter reaching record levels,” she said. The spread of solar panels on rooftops and the addition of new solar and windfarms to the grid meant spot power prices were often zero during the middle of the day, and regularly lurched into negative territory. Prices were zero or negative for 16% of all trading intervals during the quarter, more than double the previous share set during the final three months of 2020 at 7%. “Notably, the occurrence of negative spot prices this quarter was up across the NEM, with records set in all regions including New South Wales where negative prices were previously rare,” Aemo said in its accompanying report. Spring in southern Australia can be stormy, resulting in increased output from windfarms. New wind turbine capacity helped increase the periods of very high renewables output in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. As a result, stints of negative prices increased overnight for those three states in particular. In Victoria, average spot prices between 10am and 3.30pm fell from an average of $30 a MWh in 2020 to just 1c a MWh during August and September, Aemo said. SA reached average negative prices during that time slot in the March quarter of this year, the first time such an outcome has been seen in the market’s history for one region. Increased rooftop solar use also meant consumers reduced the need to access the grid for power. “The continued growth in distributed PV pushed minimum operational demand levels to record lows,” Mouchaileh said. “In NSW, minimum demand from the grid fell to 4,872MW, the lowest level since [the first quarter of] 2000, while South Australia’s minimum demand record fell by 21% to 236MW.” The abundance of renewable energy also meant that at times the grid could not take all the power being generated. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Curtailment of grid-scale wind and solar power reached new highs during the quarter, tripling from 118MW in the June quarter to 351MW in the September quarter. The story was similar in Western Australia, which operates on a separate grid from the eastern states. Renewable energy provided a record share of demand during the quarter, including a new high of 70% during one interval on 7 September, Aemo said. Total WA domestic gas consumption was also down about 5% from a year earlier to 95.3 petajoules."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2021/dec/09/majority-of-universities-in-uk-not-on-track-to-meet-emissions-targets","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-09T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Majority of universities in UK ‘not on track to meet emissions targets’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/09/majority-of-universities-in-uk-not-on-track-to-meet-emissions-targets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2021/dec/09/majority-of-universities-in-uk-not-on-track-to-meet-emissions-targets","fields":{"headline":"Majority of universities in UK ‘not on track to meet emissions targets’","bodyText":"More than half of universities are not on track to meet their emissions targets, according to an analysis. The student network People and Planet has published its annual sustainability university league, which found that 46% of higher education institutions were on course to meet the target, up from a third in 2019. But the majority were still not on track to meet the target set for the 2020-21 academic year by the former funding agency the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) in 2010. The league table assessed 154 institutions based on 13 categories including environmental policy and strategy, ethical investment and banking, carbon management and carbon reduction. Manchester Metropolitan University topped the table with a total score of 86.3%, up from second place in 2019. The table was not published in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Manchester Metropolitan’s vice-chancellor, Prof Malcolm Press, said they were “absolutely delighted”, adding: “Sustainability forms an integral part of everything that we do, from our teaching and research, to the way that we build and use our campus. “We know the environment is one of the top concerns for people of all ages and this award demonstrates the pivotal role that sustainability plays in university life at Manchester Metropolitan.” Its initiatives include developing a carbon literacy programme for all staff and students and a toolkit used by dozens of universities globally, a student-led sustainable food network, electric vehicles on campus and a hydrogen fuel cell innovation centre. The report found it had cut carbon emissions by 61% since 2005. King’s College London was placed second with 79.5% and Nottingham Trent University was third with 78.8%. At the bottom of the table were the Courtauld Institute of Art with 2.4%, the University College of Osteopathy (UCO) with 2.3% and the University of Sunderland with 0.7% – all of which said they did not submit data to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa). The most dramatic change came from Durham, which jumped 66 places compared with 2019 – from 96th position to 30th. Other big changes came from Imperial College London, which jumped 64 places up to 66th, and Cardiff Metropolitan University, which rose 63 places to finish fifth, becoming the highest scoring Welsh university. The University of Oxford rose 20 places to 25th place, while the University of Cambridge dropped 15 places to finish 82nd. London Metropolitan University made the largest carbon emission reductions, with a cut of 80% since 2005-06. Universities performed best in the education for sustainable development category, which assesses how they integrate sustainability into teaching and learning. But they performed less well in ethical investment and banking, with an average mark of 31%, despite more than half of universities having committed to divest from fossil fuels. They also performed poorly in managing carbon, with an average mark of 30%. The research found 51% of universities had made no commitment to removing fossil fuels from their investment policies. However, 40% of universities had introduced full divestment policies and 9% had made a partial commitment. After changes to higher education by the government, under which the Office for Students (OfS) took oversight of the sector from Hefce, it is no longer mandatory for universities to provide data on carbon reduction and other sustainability issues to the Hesa. People and Planet called for the reporting of this data to be made mandatory once again and for regulatory leadership from the OfS. Jack Ruane, the manager of People and Planet’s university league, said although improvements had been made in carbon reduction, “it’s still not good overall” and he hoped the gains made during the pandemic would not be “squandered”. Reliable sustainability credentials were vital for universities to attract prospective students, he said. “Students are wise to greenwashing. If a university says they are sustainable but invests in fossil fuels, students are not going to believe the sustainability credentials that institution claims. So it’s very much already part of the decision-making of students.” As a home to students, social space and workplace, campuses had the potential to change the long-term habits of thousands, Ruane added. The OfS said climate change was a “crucial issue for us all” and universities had an important role in reducing emissions. “The OfS does not have explicit powers in relation to the collection of emissions data. However, we welcome the fact that universities are increasingly taking collective responsibility for responding to climate change,” an OfS spokesperson said. The Courtauld said it was “committed to sustainability and has been making progress” but as a small institution it did not have the resources to make the relevant documentation publicly available to be scored. The University College of Osteopathy said it was unable to submit estates management data this year, adding: “We do not believe this is an accurate reflection of our performance or our commitment to environmental and ethical issues.” Sunderland said its last place positioning did not reflect its “full commitment – and successful work – around sustainability” and said it did not choose to submit the most recent data to the Hesa estates management record. “Our environmental sustainability plan to 2025 is already delivering a lasting impact on the environment, including investment in a new fleet of electric vehicles, installation of air source heat pumps and an ongoing solar power project already implemented on City campus now being rolled out to our St Peter’s campus,” a spokesperson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2023/jan/23/uk-green-growth-cbi-uk-economy-national-grid-energy-use-cold-weather-ftse-sterling-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-23T16:22:53Z","webTitle":"National Grid to pay UK homes and businesses to cut electricity use again on Tuesday – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jan/23/uk-green-growth-cbi-uk-economy-national-grid-energy-use-cold-weather-ftse-sterling-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2023/jan/23/uk-green-growth-cbi-uk-economy-national-grid-energy-use-cold-weather-ftse-sterling-business-live","fields":{"headline":"National Grid to pay UK homes and businesses to cut electricity use again on Tuesday – as it happened","bodyText":"Earlier my collegue Alex Lawson published this handy guide to how the National Grid’s demand flexibility service works in practice. In summary, households that are eligible (those with a smart meter and a participating supplier) must reduce their consumption within the designated time period by at least 30%. The greater the reduction, the greater the discount, which is automatically applied to the bill. Newsflash: Households and businesses will be paid to cut their electricity use again on Tuesday as National Grid aims to reduce the strain on Great Britain’s energy network. The Electricity System Operator said on Monday that it was looking for bids from suppliers to help save up to 341 megawatts (MW) of power between 4.30pm and 6pm on Tuesday. The plan, which could still be abandoned if conditions improve, would help the grid balance supply and demand by paying people to reduce the amount of electricity they use. The service will be used live for the first time on Monday afternoon between 5-6pm. Separately, it is understood National Grid is unlikely to call three coal-fired units at power stations which were put on standby into action. On Sunday, National Grid asked Drax to start “warming” two of its coal units at its North Yorkshire site and EDF to do the same for one at its West Burton plant in Nottinghamshire to ensure supplies were available on Monday. However, those units are now unlikely to be used. Spotify will cut 600 jobs, adding another name to the parade of tech company names who have announced job cuts recently: Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and Meta have all made thousands of redundancies. And then of course there’s Twitter … For all of those tech companies investors will be looking at how far they think expected recessions will affect earnings. A big week of earnings for US companies will test how they fared during winter. Shares in Spotify have gained 3% – they were up by as much as 8.5% – after confirming plans to cut 6% of its workforce. But it comes after its shares dropped 45% over the course of the last 12 months. Spotify will incur charges of between €35m and €40m as part of the cuts, but investors are fearful of a much bigger impact from the slowing global economy, and rising interest rates also make the promise of future earnings less valuable in the present day. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, a platform, said: Global digital spending is suffering, and ad revenues are falling with it, prompting tech companies, which not long ago were the darlings of the stock market, to reduce labour costs in preparation for the economic downturn. Cost-of-living pressures mean consumers are looking for ways to reduce their discretionary spending on expenses such as music subscriptions and other non-essential services. Silicon Valley’s sense of invincibility spurred a period of overzealous expansion during the era of rock-bottom interest rates. But the tech sector was swiftly brought back down to Earth in 2022 on the back of rising inflation and interest rates, the fading technological boom during the pandemic-era when most of us were glued to our devices, and a slowing global economic backdrop. The result has been a raft of disappointing share price performances and an accompanying slew of job cuts.

The US activist investor firm Elliott Investment Management has taken a multibillion-dollar stake in Salesforce, the business software company that owns the Slack messaging platform. Twitter is planning an advertising-free version of its subscription product, as the company attempts to raise revenue and increase demand for its premium offering. The companies running Britain’s four remaining steel blast furnaces have been offered £600m in government support to invest in lower-emissions technology. Energy companies are to be investigated by the regulator Ofgem after a sharp increase in the number of struggling households being forced on to prepayment meters.

It looks like those coal plants that were fired up have now been stood down – National Grid does not think they will be needed after all this evening. Reuters reports: Britain’s National Grid has stood down plans to fire up coal plants on Monday evening which it had asked operators on Sunday to get ready in case high power demand meant they needed to provide extra electricity. A spokesman for National Grid, which is responsible for ensuring the country’s electricity supply, said by telephone on Monday the supply picture had improved since it issued the notice. Music streaming company Spotify has announced it will cut the jobs of about 6% of its workforce, or about 600 workers, the latest in a series of big technology companies to announce redundancies. Chief executive Daniel Ek wrote in a message to employees that the Swedish company was restructuring to promote “speed”. As part of the restructuring influential content head Dawn Ostroff will leave the business. Big technology companies in the US have already announced tens of thousands of job cuts after a year in which their stock market value plummeted amid rising interest rates. Microsoft is cutting 10,000 jobs, Amazon will cut 18,000, Salesforce is cutting about 8,000, and Meta is cutting about 11,000. Ek said that Spotify’s operational spending grew twice as fast as revenue in 2022, meaning it needed to cut back. Of the redundancies, Ek wrote: While I believe this decision is right for Spotify, I understand that with our historic focus on growth, many of you will view this as a shift in our culture. But as we evolve and grow as a business, so must our way of working while still staying true to our core values. As you are well aware, over the last few months we’ve made a considerable effort to rein-in costs, but it simply hasn’t been enough. Like many other leaders, I hoped to sustain the strong tailwinds from the pandemic and believed that our broad global business and lower risk to the impact of a slowdown in ads would insulate us. In hindsight, I was too ambitious in investing ahead of our revenue growth. Today for the first time National Grid will pay households to cut back their energy use. It could – hopefully – be a forerunner of a smarter, more efficient energy system. The system will swing into action for the first time between 5pm and 6pm – although only those who have actually received smart meters will be able to benefit. Alex Lawson, the Guardian’s energy correspondent, has more details of the scheme: The scheme is only open to businesses and households with a smart meter whose supplier or aggregator is one of the 26 firms (including most of the big ones) to have signed up. More than 1m households and businesses have signed up to participate and most suppliers have closed the scheme to new participants. Consumers are likely to use various methods to save power during the period – including making sure none of their devices are charging, or pushing back meal times. A household’s power use will be compared with their normal usage for that time of day, and they will receive about £3 for every kilowatt hour saved. You can read the full Q&amp;A here: Several companies are working on introducing more flexibility into the energy system. One big hope is the advent of electric cars – essentially a big, rechargeable battery on wheels. When they are plugged in to a house owners could in the future be able to sell back energy from the car’s battery to the grid at peak times. Car owners could then charge the vehicle overnight, when prices are cheaper. That would lower peak generation demand, and also make use of wind and solar power when it is abundant but demand is lower, such as windy nights or sunny mornings. That seven-month high for sterling this morning is looking like a brief encounter. The pound is now trading at $1.2359, down 0.3% for the day. That’s down almost a cent on the morning high of $1.2447. The UK government has offered £600m in support for Britain’s four remaining steel blast furnaces to invest in lower-emissions technology. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce the support of £300m each for British Steel and Tata Steel as soon as this week, although the timing will depend on the companies accepting the offers. The BBC first reported the government offer of support to both companies. The steel industry is one of the most difficult to decarbonise because of the huge energy requirements and the use of coking coal in iron smelting, a process which emits carbon dioxide directly. British Steel, owned by China’s Jingye, and Indian-owned Tata Steel are both looking at how to upgrade their plants to electric arc furnaces, which heat recycled metal using electricity that can in theory come from zero-emissions source. The British Steel and Tata plants employ thousands of workers with two furnaces each at Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire, and Port Talbot in South Wales respectively. British Steel has been in talks with the government over support since the autumn to help it with the increased costs of carbon credits as well as much higher energy prices following Russia’s full-on invasion of Ukraine 11 months ago. Tata, meanwhile, has been in talks over the longer-term future of the Port Talbot site for several years. It is understood any government support would be conditional on the companies also committing to investing in the plants themselves, and will be tied to environmental investments in order to comply with state aid rules. Tata Group’s chairman, Natarajan Chandrasekaran, last summer said Port Talbot would require £3bn – including £1.5bn from the government, to keep the site operational. Industry sources question whether that much would be required to upgrade two blast furnaces, although £300m would probably only cover the costs of upgrading one. British Steel is also thought to be looking at the possibility of carbon capture and storage for one of the blast furnaces as Scunthorpe, a method of emissions reduction that would retain the UK’s ability to continue primary steel production rather than relying on recycled scrap. The steel industry has been crying out for support to decarbonise for several years. Labour has committed to spending £3bn to upgrade the UK’s steel industry. Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, national officer for GMB, one of the unions representing steelworkers, said: Any investment in the UK’s beleaguered steel industry is welcome. But ultimately this is a sticking plaster – it does nothing to address the wider issues in the industry; catastrophic energy costs and a grossly uneven international trading environment. The pub group Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner has issued a profit warning, blaming months of train strikes for a £4m slump in sales including a plunge in festive season trade. Fuller’s, which has more than 400 pubs mainly in London and south-east England, said that since the start of October industrial action on the rail network had cost the business £4m in sales. As a consequence, the group said that profits will now come in below market expectations when it reports results for the year to April in the summer. Sales for the crucial four-week Christmas and new year period were up 38% on the previous year, when the hospitality industry was crippled by restrictions relating to spread of the Omicron variant. However, Fuller’s said the run of strikes by various rail unions in December and January meant sales were down 5% on pre-Covid trading for the same period in 2019. Sterling has notched a gain today against the US dollar: it is up by 0.16% to about $1.2413. But, more notably, earlier in the session the rate briefly touched $1.2447, its highest level in seven months. You can see from this chart just how far the exchange rate has come back since the dark days (for the UK government at least) of nearing pound-dollar parity. That vertiginous drop in the pound’s value in September will forever be labelled “Truss and Kwarteng”, after the UK’s shortest-serving prime minister and her chancellor, who only avoided the ignominy of being shortest in that job because another died in office. Since they were chucked out, UK financial markets have at least calmed, and there are some signs from economic data that have suggested the economic position is not quite as bad as first feared, while other indicators have suggested the Bank of England may not need to raise interest rates quite so quickly. The world’s best-performing hedge fund earned $16bn – you read that correctly – in profits for investors last year, the biggest dollar gain in history. Ken Griffin’s Citadel, which was paid $16bn, moved into the top spot ahead of Bridgewater, which earned $6.2bn, according to data from investment firm LCH Investments. Hedge funds are generally defined by their ability to make long or short investments and use complex products like derivatives and borrowed money to maximise their profits. When they manage billions of dollars, like Citadel, they can make billions themselves. From Reuters: Citadel, which was founded by Griffin in 1990, saw its flagship Wellington portfolio gain 38% last year while its fixed income fund was up 33%, according to a person familiar with the numbers. That performance made for enormous returns: it charged investors roughly $12bn in expenses and performance fees, the Financial Times reported. But the gain for the 20 top hedge fund managers was $22.4bn in 2022, which was actually the smallest gain since 2016, according to the LCH data. That was because of some almighty losses for equity funds who had relied on big technology stocks for their returns. The Financial Times reported that Tiger Global was a big loser – in fact, it was the biggest loser in hedge fund history, according to the LCH data: It was one of the highest-profile casualties when markets reversed, making $18bn of losses across its funds last year […] According to LCH, this ranks as the biggest annual loss in hedge fund history. LCH’s research does not include Tiger’s private equity business. Tiger Global declined to comment. The maker of London’s black cabs, the London Electric Vehicle Company (LEVC), is due to receive significant new investment from its Chinese owner, Geely. LEVC executives told Reuters in an interview that the company would become a high-volume, all-electric brand with a range of commercial and passenger vehicles. It currently makes a hybrid vehicle with 64 miles of battery range and a petrol “range extender” – a small internal combustion engine that recharges the battery. Alex Nan, LEVC’s chief executive, said: We need a developed product portfolio. We need to make big investments in terms of the technology and infrastructure. Geely will make consistent investments into LEVC because this is a very unique project. LEVC has struggled in recent years. In October it cut 140 jobs, blaming the pandemic, disruption to supply chains and “significant global economic challenges”. “Geely fully supports the new transition strategy laid out by LEVC’s board and executive team,” Geely said in a statement. LEVC currently has the capacity to build 3,000 taxis a year running on a single shift at its Coventry factory. Another LEVC executive said that could easily be increased to 20,000 and the plant had room to expand, Reuters reported.

It’s up 0.2% at 7,786 points. Remember, the FTSE 100 is not too far off its all-time high. That is mainly thanks to its contingent of banks and oil companies, who have benefited in the past 12 months while growth stocks like technology companies have faltered. Central bank tightening is behind that: higher interest rates make the present value of future income lower. The numbers to watch out for: the FTSE’s record intraday high of 7,903 points was set in May 2018, before closing at 7844.07. We’ll be on watch if it approaches that record this week. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. The head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) will today say the UK is falling behind the US and EU in developing the green economy, according to a biting assessment of the government’s failure to invest. Tony Danker, the CBI’s director-general, will call for the government to aim for faster growth, with low-carbon technologies a key focus, in a speech today (Monday) at University College London. The US and Europe are “outspending and outsmarting us” on green growth, Danker said. The White House under President Joe Biden has passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which will direct $369bn (£298bn) toward investing in renewable energy and reducing America’s planet-heating emissions, while the EU is considering ramping up its already considerable spending in response. Danker (who formerly worked for the publisher of the Guardian) said: We’re behind the Germans on heat-pumps, insulation and building retrofits, the French on EV charging infrastructure, and the US on operational carbon capture and storage projects – despite the UK’s North Sea advantage. We’re lagging all three on hydrogen funding. While our competitors across Europe, Asia and the US are making their move, and going hell for leather, we seem to be second guessing ourselves and hoping for the best. It’s time for us to take those hard decisions, generating the forward momentum not only to limit recession this year but also get us really growing next.

The service has been trialled but not run in a live situation before. It will run from 5pm to 6pm on Monday, its Electricity Supply Operator arm said. The cold weather also means that National Grid has asked coal-fired power stations to heat up to be ready to meet peak demand (around the early evening as people start heating their homes and food). National Grid said: “These are precautionary measures to maintain the buffer of spare capacity we need.” Full story: The agenda 9:30am GMT: UK foreign direct investment involving UK companies (2021) 9:30am GMT: UK national balance sheet estimates (2022)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2019/jul/06/ethical-investing-energise-africa-a-solar-scheme-with-the-power-to-change-lives","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-06T07:34:53Z","webTitle":"Solar power: how investing can help to change lives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/06/ethical-investing-energise-africa-a-solar-scheme-with-the-power-to-change-lives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2019/jul/06/ethical-investing-energise-africa-a-solar-scheme-with-the-power-to-change-lives","fields":{"headline":"Solar power: how investing can help to change lives","bodyText":"Fight the climate crisis and earn a return of 5% at the same time, plus enjoy a guarantee on your investment. That’s the offer from an ethical investment scheme that allows people to put money into companies providing African families with access to clean, affordable solar energy. It’s notable that this scheme is supported by UK aid money from the Department for International Development (DfID), and offers a guarantee, although this only covers the first £100 of capital invested and applies to first-time investors. Energise Africa enables ordinary people to invest in bonds issued by solar companies, allowing them to provide “life-changing” solar home systems to low-income families in countries such as Kenya, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. With a minimum investment of £50 and expected annual returns that have in the past typically ranged from 5% to 7%, this is a potentially straightforward and accessible way for people to make sure their money is doing some good. And the guarantee on offer to new investors will definitely provide reassurance. However, above and beyond that guarantee, your capital is at risk, and the returns are not guaranteed. In the worst-case scenario, if there is some kind of disaster, crisis or bankruptcy, you could lose some or all of your capital and would not be able to get redress from the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme or complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. So this is not going to be for everyone. Energise Africa was launched in 2017 and is the result of a link-up between Ethex, a UK-based ethical investment platform, and Lendahand, a Dutch-based crowdfunding platform. It boasts a community of more than 1,800 investors and partners who have so far raised more than £8.9m. The platform says it has successfully closed more than 60 fundraising projects, which means its investors have helped about 350,000 people to access affordable, clean energy. An estimated 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa live without access to electricity. Many use traditional energy sources such as kerosene lamps, candles and batteries but these can be dangerous as well as costly. Having a solar system can allow children to read and study in the evening, and enable a person to install a fridge so they can sell cold drinks. In terms of the investment offer, this involves putting money into unsecured bonds that are not listed on a public market. Essentially, you are lending money to businesses that sell small solar home systems to African families, with a typical term of two to three years. At the time of writing, there were two projects on the Energise Africa website open for investment: both two-year bonds with an expected interest rate of 5% a year. The company behind the two-year product is Cambridge-based Azuri, which has set an investment target of £200,000. The company says each £200 invested will enable one Kenyan family to buy an Azuri SolarPlus home system in affordable instalments. Meanwhile, the firm behind the other bond is Sollatek, based in Mombasa, Kenya, which is seeking to raise £65,000. At the moment, all first-time Energise Africa customers are being offered a guarantee on the capital they invest, up to £100 in one project. In the event of the issuing company defaulting on its repayments, the guarantee would be called on to repay the investor their £100. Assuming there is no call on the facility, the funds will be available to provide a guarantee to other first-time investors once the bond has been fully redeemed. Energise Africa is supported by UK aid money, Virgin Unite (the nonprofit foundation of the Virgin Group), the Swiss-based Good Energies Foundation, and P4G"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/may/18/household-solar-uptake-meant-demand-on-australias-grid-in-summer-peak-fell-to-five-year-low","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-18T01:34:01Z","webTitle":"Household solar uptake meant demand on Australia’s grid in summer peak fell to five-year low","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/18/household-solar-uptake-meant-demand-on-australias-grid-in-summer-peak-fell-to-five-year-low","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/may/18/household-solar-uptake-meant-demand-on-australias-grid-in-summer-peak-fell-to-five-year-low","fields":{"headline":"Household solar uptake meant demand on Australia’s grid in summer peak fell to five-year low","bodyText":"Pressure on the national electricity grid at the peak of last summer’s heat fell to its lowest level in five years due to the rising influence of household solar panels, a new analysis has found. Summer is usually the time of greatest strain on the electricity system due to the widespread use of energy hungry air-conditioners, but the demand on the hottest day dipped this year as more electricity came from decentralised rooftop solar systems, which sit outside the grid. An audit by the energy consultant Hugh Saddler, an honorary associate professor at ANU’s Crawford school of public policy, found that household solar contributed more to meeting consumer needs than some ageing coal plants, including the Liddell generator in New South Wales and Yallourn generator in Victoria. Saddler said it underlined the role solar power was playing in making coal-fired electricity unprofitable and increased the likelihood of early coal closures, a point also made by the head of the government’s Energy Security Board, Kerry Schott. “Anyone who has got any sense is talking about it,” Saddler said. “It’s just so obvious.” Saddler’s analysis, in his regular national energy emissions audit for the Australia Institute, aligns with a separate report published by the government’s Australian Energy Regulator and released on Monday. The regulator found that black coal-fired power fell to its lowest level on record for the first three months of the year, and gas-fired electricity slumped to its lowest level in 16 years. The regulator’s chair, Clare Savage, said it was the first time electricity from large-scale solar farms was greater than from gas. “The milder temperatures during the past summer period and an additional 2,500MW of rooftop solar capacity drove lower demand and lower wholesale prices, which is good news for consumers because it should lead to lower bills,” Savage said. Saddler found demand for electricity this financial year peaked on Sunday 24 January – the hottest day in many parts of eastern Australia. He said the grid was less stretched at the summer peak than in any year since 2014-15. This showed solar was reducing the need for additional back-up from expensive plants that are turned on only at peak times, particularly gas-fired stations, he said. At the peak, solar power provided more than five times the maximum capacity of the newly announced Tallawarra B gas-fired plant. “The lower level of the 2020-21 peak, relative to each of the previous five summers, is undoubtedly mainly caused by growing supply from rooftop solar,” Saddler said. The rapid growth in solar – about 20% of households now have it, up from 0.2% in 2007 – is the clearest example of an electricity grid that is now transforming more rapidly than what was not long ago considered a “step change” scenario by the Australian Electricity Market Operator. Over the past year, renewable energy has provided 28% of electricity. Four years ago some analysts believed it was unlikely that the national renewable energy target – roughly equivalent to 23% – would be met by 2020. The target was met in 2019 and has not been replaced. Some states have introduced their own targets and schemes, and the tumbling cost of solar has made it increasingly attractive for households to install. Savage said low demand for electricity from the grid due to increased rooftop solar generation could affect the stability of the network. She pointed to the situation in South Australia, when Aemo for the first time used new powers to help stabilise the network by turning off some rooftop solar. A draft deliberation by the Australian Energy Market Commission in March recommended that households with rooftop panels be charged for exporting electricity into the power grid at sunny times when it is not needed. The commission said it was needed to prevent “traffic jams” of electricity that could destabilise the network, and could allow more household solar systems and batteries to be connected to the grid and make the system fairer for all electricity users. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, said the rise of solar was being driven by Australians wanting to put panels on their roof. He said it “defied any ideological interests”. He said he welcomed the conversation about how to deal with congestion in the grid but questioned why the proposed solution was to penalise solar households. “The reality is that we could be doing so much more,” he said. “We should be subsidising and supporting more of what we want.” Other findings of the Australia Institute audit include: Emissions from fossil fuel combustion fell by 7.3% over the year to February. More than half was due to the coronavirus pandemic. There is no evidence there was a fall in electricity use in Australia due to Covid-19 outside Victoria (where comparable data is not yet available). Petroleum emissions, mostly from transport, are expected to increase this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/apr/30/australias-electricity-grid-could-run-with-75-renewables-market-operator-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-29T22:00:03Z","webTitle":"Australia's electricity grid could run with 75% renewables, market operator says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/30/australias-electricity-grid-could-run-with-75-renewables-market-operator-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/apr/30/australias-electricity-grid-could-run-with-75-renewables-market-operator-says","fields":{"headline":"Australia's electricity grid could run with 75% renewables, market operator says","bodyText":"Australia already has the technical capacity to safely run a power grid in which 75% of the electricity comes from wind and solar and, if it gets regulations right, should occasionally reach this level within five years. A study by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) looking at how to incorporate more renewable energy into the system while maintaining grid security found wind and solar capacity was increasing rapidly, but the operation of the electricity market could hold it back unless settings were changed. Audrey Zibelman, Aemo’s chief executive, said the study made it clear that “operating approaches and market frameworks” were becoming less effective as more renewable energy was injected into the grid. “Australia already has the technical capability to safely operate a power system where three quarters of our energy at times comes from wind and solar generation,” she said. “However, to do so requires changes in our markets and regulatory requirements. Otherwise, Aemo will be required to limit the contribution of these wind and solar resources to 50% or 60% of electricity supply at any point in time, even though they are the lowest cost way of providing electricity.” The overall share of renewable energy in the National Electricity Market (NEM) reached 26% over the past month, according to the website Open NEM. It has occasionally risen to more than 50% for brief sunny and windy periods when demand for heating and air-conditioning was low. The Aemo study, published on Thursday, calls for changes well before 2025 to allow greater use of clean energy, including the introduction of new standards to maximise the potential of rooftop solar panels and construction of new transmission lines. It says Aemo found no insurmountable reasons why the grid could not not operate securely at even higher levels of wind and solar generation after 2025, especially given the pace of technological advancement. Key challenges to overcome in the short term include increasing variability and uncertainty in energy supply, dealing with changes in frequency and system strength, and the impact of greater generation from distributed sources, which differ from the traditional model of each state having a handful of large power plants. The report comes as Aemo celebrates steps taken last week to allow energy generated at five solar farms in western Victoria and south-western New South Wales to resume full power supply into the grid after stability issues were dealt with. The plants had been limited to half capacity for eight months due to grid congestion. The Clean Energy Council has warned, and academics have found, that transmission and storage limitations are among the greatest roadblocks to the expansion of renewable energy. There has also been criticism of the Australian Electricity Market Commission, which sets rules for the grid, as being resistant to changes that would accelerate the influx of relatively cheap, variable clean energy. The report does not mention another often raised roadblock to future clean energy investment: the lack of an overarching national policy to guide the closure and replacement of coal-fired plants. The National Electricity Market, which covers the grid-connected country bar Western Australia and the Northern Territory, already has 17 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity. Aemo found under a “central” scenario mapped before the onset of Covid-19 that this could increase to 27 gigawatts by 2025. Zibelman said Aemo did not underestimate the scale of the work required to successfully adapt the national market, and said the report – the first in a multi-year project – would have far-reaching implications for the energy sector. “Given the pace and complexity of change in the [market], the study highlights the need for flexible market and regulatory frameworks that can adapt swiftly and effectively as our understanding of the changing power system evolves,” she said. In a statement on Thursday, the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said the report highlighted the challenges of integrating record amounts of renewable energy into the grid. Taylor said the study recognised solar and wind energy “aren’t enough”, and the inertia in the system provided by synchronous generation would be crucial to maintaining grid security. He said an example of synchronous generation was a gas-fired plant, which runs on fossil fuel. It follows Taylor last week saying he wanted a “gas-fired recovery” from the Covid-19 pandemic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2021/sep/07/amazon-uk-arm-pays-38m-more-corporation-tax-despite-19bn-sales-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-07T22:00:20Z","webTitle":"Amazon UK arm pays £3.8m more corporation tax despite £1.9bn sales rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/07/amazon-uk-arm-pays-38m-more-corporation-tax-despite-19bn-sales-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2021/sep/07/amazon-uk-arm-pays-38m-more-corporation-tax-despite-19bn-sales-rise","fields":{"headline":"Amazon UK arm pays £3.8m more corporation tax despite £1.9bn sales rise","bodyText":"Amazon’s key UK business paid just £3.8m more corporation tax last year than in 2019, even as sales increased by £1.89bn. Accounts filed at Companies House this week show that the corporation tax contribution of Amazon UK Services – the group’s warehouse and logistics operation, thought to employ the majority of the group’s UK workforce – was £18.3m in the year to December 2020, up 26% from £14.5m a year before. Profits at the division rose by a quarter over the same period to £128m, while sales soared by 64% to £4.85bn. That performance helped boost Amazon’s total revenues in the UK, from retail, logistics and IT services, to £20.63bn during 2020, approximately double the takings of Marks &amp; Spencer and up slightly more than 50% from £13.73bn a year before. The company, which has made its founder and outgoing chief executive, Jeff Bezos, a fortune of more than $200bn, tried to fend off accusations of tax underpayment by issuing a statement that said its UK business as a whole paid out £492m in “direct taxes” last year, up from £293m a year before. That figure includes employer’s national insurance, business rates, stamp duty and corporation tax. The company did not break out its total corporation tax bill, but at least half of the “direct taxes” figure is thought to be accounted for by national insurance and business rates. The group also said it invested £1.6bn in the UK, more than double the £690m a year spent before, as the group extended its operations to meet high demand during the pandemic. Investments include 11 on-site solar power schemes to help run its facilities, and a 350MW windfarm project off the coast of Scotland. Amazon now employs more than 55,000 people in the UK, including 10,000 jobs created this year, with more staff being recruited to meet soaring demand. Amid a recruitment crisis across the UK, Amazon has resorted to offering new warehouse recruits a £1,000 joining bonus in an attempt to attract staff. The company said in a statement: “We are proud of the significant economic contribution we are making to the UK economy. Looking ahead, we know that the UK remains full of opportunity and we continue to be excited by the potential to continue to invest, create jobs, develop talent and have a positive impact in communities across the country.” Paul Monaghan, head of the Fair Tax Foundation campaign group, described the company’s figures as “more smoke and mirrors from Amazon, who are still refusing to disclose exactly how much total profit they make in the UK, and how much tax they pay on this”. He continued: “Much of their UK income continues to be shunted to Luxembourg, where there is a ‘loss-making’ subsidiary that is not only not paying tax, but is generating enormous tax reliefs that can be used in the future to ensure that little or no tax continues to be paid. Amazon is growing its market domination across the globe on the back of income that is largely untaxed – allowing it to unfairly undercut local businesses that take a more responsible approach.” Amazon officially reports its British retail sales through Luxembourg, with Amazon UK services representing only a small part of the wider UK operation. Fresh questions were raised over Amazon’s tax planning this spring after its latest corporate filings in Luxembourg revealed that the company collected record sales income of €44bn (£38bn) in Europe last year but did not have to pay any corporation tax to the Grand Duchy. Accounts for Amazon EU Sarl, through which it sells products to hundreds of millions of households in the UK and across Europe, show that despite collecting record income, the Luxembourg unit made a €1.2bn loss and therefore paid no tax. • This story was amended on 8 September 2021 to correct the name of the Fair Tax Foundation in the 10th paragraph"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/oct/13/eu-energy-official-bloc-must-end-reliance-foreign-fossil-fuels-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-13T15:12:02Z","webTitle":"EU energy official says bloc must end reliance on foreign fossil fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/13/eu-energy-official-bloc-must-end-reliance-foreign-fossil-fuels-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/oct/13/eu-energy-official-bloc-must-end-reliance-foreign-fossil-fuels-russia","fields":{"headline":"EU energy official says bloc must end reliance on foreign fossil fuels","bodyText":"Russia’s failure to boost short-term supplies to ease Europe’s energy price shock shows why the EU needs to wean itself off foreign fossil fuels and scale up renewables, the bloc’s top energy official has said. Kadri Simson, the European commissioner for energy, also defended the EU’s green deal plan to move to a net zero carbon economy by 2050, amid calls for a climate policy rethink from central European leaders, as she set out the EU’s response to the energy price spike after wholesale electricity prices increased by 200% over the last year. The European Commission has been under pressure to launch an investigation into Russia’s Gazprom, which is accused of seeking to take advantage of high global prices. Calling for an EU inquiry, a group of MEPs last month suggested the Russian state monopoly could be guilty of “deliberate market manipulation” in order to pressure regulators to speed up approval of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea. Vladimir Putin on Wednesday dismissed the idea that Russia was using energy as a weapon: “This is just politically motivated chatter, which has no basis whatsoever,” the Russian president told an energy conference in Moscow. He said Russia was meeting its contractual obligations and was ready to increase supply if asked. Simson said the commission remained vigilant over any “manipulation and speculation and anti-competitive activity” on the European market, but did not level this charge at Russia, which supplies 41% of EU gas. “Our initial assessment indicated that Gazprom has been fulfilling its long-term contracts, while providing little or no additional supply. Ultimately, the solution is the same whether it is about prices, security of supply or climate. Scaling up local, renewable energy is the way forward,” she told reporters. “I would prefer to be in the position where we aren’t dependent on foreign fossil fuels.” But a Polish government source rejected the commission’s analysis on Russia, accusing Gazprom of trying to pressure the EU into a swift decision on Nord Stream 2 and permitting it “relaxed” operational rules. The “commission should therefore verify Gazprom’s actions in 2021 in the context of potential market abuse”, the source said. Construction of the pipeline was completed last month but it cannot start delivering gas until it clears regulatory hurdles in Germany and Brussels. European households’ energy bills have jumped in response to a mix of economic, policy and meteorological factors. Surging global demand, largely driven by China’s post-pandemic economic rebound, has combined with gas reserves depleted across the continent by last year’s cold winter. Meanwhile the EU’s carbon price has hit record levels, but analysts say it only accounts for a small part of price increases. According to commission analysis, countries that generate more of their energy from wind and solar power have been less affected by increases in gas prices. “We are not facing an energy price surge because of our climate policy or because renewables are expensive,” Simson said. “We are facing it because the fossil fuel prices are spiking. We do not yet have the green affordable energy for everyone. We need to speed up the green transition, not slow it down.” Politicians in Hungary and Poland have sought to link the EU’s emissions trading scheme – a key part of the bloc’s environmental policy – to the surge in gas prices. Yet independent analysis suggests energy price rises are largely driven by increasing global demand for gas. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Simson announced the EU executive would consider the widelytrailed joint purchase of emergency gas reserves – an idea pushed by Spain, one of the countries hit hardest by the energy price rise. The proposal falls far short of immediate action, reflecting scepticism in Brussels that EU member states have the appetite for this common action. The commission will “explore the possible benefits of joint procurement of reserve stocks … to allow pooling forces and creating strategic reserves”, said a policy paper published on Wednesday. As with the EU joint procurement of coronavirus vaccines, participation would be voluntary. EU leaders will pronounce their initial verdict on the idea at a summit next week, but some countries have already sounded a cautious note. The paper is likely to disappoint member states looking for an immediate response. Rather than an action plan, it is mostly a list of suggestions EU governments could take under existing rules. Governments are reminded, for example, that they could give grants to the poorest consumers for energy-saving measures; take action to prevent people being cut off for unpaid bills; cut energy taxes; and consider moving renewable energy levies off energy bills for a period."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2021/sep/24/natalie-imbruglia-firebird-review-a-canny-and-carefree-comeback","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-23T17:30:05Z","webTitle":"Natalie Imbruglia: Firebird review – a canny and carefree comeback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/sep/24/natalie-imbruglia-firebird-review-a-canny-and-carefree-comeback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2021/sep/24/natalie-imbruglia-firebird-review-a-canny-and-carefree-comeback","fields":{"headline":"Natalie Imbruglia: Firebird review – a canny and carefree comeback","bodyText":"It’s the kind of comeback most pop stars can only dream of. In 2021, nearly 24 years after she broke out with her international smash hit Torn, Natalie Imbruglia has played a crucial part in two of the year’s coolest pop records. A sample of her voice drifts in – like a warped AM radio transmission – from Pond House, the delightful, breakbeat-heavy first single from stalwart British pop band Saint Ettienne’s 10th studio album, I’ve Been Trying To Tell You. And her spirit emanates from Solar Power, the breezy and sun-dappled third album by New Zealand pop prodigy Lorde, which was inspired by the heart-on-sleeve 90s pop style, with its “bright, forward, shimmery acoustics” that Imbruglia typified. In both cases, Imbruglia represents both a stylistic guide and a kind of nostalgic ideal – an icon of openness, brightness, airiness, sentimental calm and supreme chill. The cultural mood is just right, in other words, for the grand return of Imbruglia herself. It’s been more than a decade since the Sydney-born, Oxfordshire-based musician has released an album of originals – Male, a covers record, was released in 2015 – and although comeback records sometimes carry a whiff of desperation, Imbruglia is clearly still tapped into the easy amiability that’s made her such a significant reference point over the past 12 months. Firebird, her sixth record and first for indie behemoth BMG, is delightfully unburdened: a carefree survey of pop and rock trends that re-establishes the fact that, at her best, Imbruglia is a canny lyricist and an incisive, whip-smart writer of hooks. At its best, as on the sprightly Not Sorry, Imbruglia positions herself entirely outside the craven economy of falls-from-grace and comebacks, embodying a kind of peaceful ebullience: “I’ve got life in my heart, life in the bank, life in my body / I’m not sorry.” Just as Lorde and Saint Etienne referenced Imbruglia to convey a specific but ineffable vibe, the highlights on Firebird touch on distinctive music trends as a kind of shorthand for certain feelings. The percussive strut of On My Way, one of the best tracks here, recalls Haim’s wonderful 2020 record Women In Music Pt III, and its empowered, head-held-high classic rock sound. What It Feels Like is animated by a headrush 80s pulse, and it recalls the head-over-heels, lovestruck dizziness of Carly Rae Jepsen’s Emotion: “Now I know what it feels like / To love somebody like I love you,” she sings, effusive and ecstatic. Build It Better, with its rousing chorus of “When it all falls down / Gotta build it better”, is cleanly anthemic in the style of Taylor Swift’s 1989, and Nothing Missing, co-written with KT Tunstall, channels the defiant angst of the 90s and 2000s pop of which Imbruglia herself was a part. As the record progresses, it dips into sighing spaghetti western theatrics (Human Touch) and vocal-led balladry (Dive to the Deep, Invisible Things), but it’s this early stretch of the record that’s most compelling, its stylistic hopscotch suggesting a host of alternate realities in which Imbruglia reinvented herself as an indie-rock icon or synthpop doyenne. Trying your hand at the sounds of the moment, though, is a double-edged sword: although Firebird is always tied together by Imbruglia’s clarion voice, the production around her leaves something to be desired. You get the sense that this is an album for those who, like Imbruglia, might have checked out of pop music for the past decade: people who won’t listen to On My Way and wish for the analog warmth of the actual Haim record; who won’t wish the bass on What It Feels Like hit a little harder and the synths dazzled a little brighter. There’s a glazed-over, plasticky feel to the actual music that lets down Imbruglia’s sharp-as-a-tack writing. Still, it’s hard to see Firebird as anything other than a victory for Imbruglia herself, who radiates gravitas and contentment throughout. “I’m aiming higher, older and wiser,” she sings on On My Way, “This thrill could be real.” It certainly feels like it. • Firebird by Natalie Imbruglia is out now through BMG"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/nov/18/green-hydrogen-beats-blue-on-emissions-and-financial-cost-australian-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-17T16:30:41Z","webTitle":"Green hydrogen beats blue on emissions and financial cost, Australian study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/18/green-hydrogen-beats-blue-on-emissions-and-financial-cost-australian-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/nov/18/green-hydrogen-beats-blue-on-emissions-and-financial-cost-australian-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Green hydrogen beats blue on emissions and financial cost, Australian study finds","bodyText":"Hydrogen produced by fossil fuels is more expensive, will release more greenhouse gas emissions and comes with a greater risk of creating stranded assets, according to new research from the Australian National University. In the paper, published in the peer-reviewed engineering journal Applied Energy, researchers compared the emissions and financial cost of producing hydrogen using fossil fuels or renewable energy. “Blue hydrogen” is produced using natural gas while “green hydrogen” is made by running an electric current through water using an electrolyser powered by renewable energy such as wind or solar. “Clean hydrogen” is the term used for when carbon capture and storage is used to capture carbon dioxide emissions during the production process, similar to proposals for “clean coal”. Hydrogen has become central to the Australian government’s current proposal to reach net zero, and blue hydrogen was endorsed by Australia’s former chief scientist Dr Alan Finkel as a way to build industrial capability. But the ANU researchers found emissions from hydrogen made from fossil fuels would still be “substantial”. Researchers found current emissions estimates of CCS fail to account for fugitive emissions such as methane – a potent greenhouse gas that leaks into the atmosphere during the extraction of natural gas. These emissions are not caught by CCS and because creating hydrogen from natural gas is not totally efficient – it takes more gas to make hydrogen for energy than it would to simply burn the gas – methane emissions will continue to grow with the rate of extraction. As the rate of extraction grows to supply export markets, so will these emissions. The researchers also found the financial cost of creating blue hydrogen using CCS becomes more expensive as a plant gets closer to capturing 90% of emissions. This is because it becomes harder to capture CO2 as concentrations begin to fall. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dr Fiona Beck, a co-author of the report and an engineer with the ANU Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions, said CCS requires an expensive “bespoke solution for every plant” which adds to the risk these projects may become stranded assets. “Green hydrogen is more expensive right now but it has the capacity to very quickly reduce in cost,” Beck said. “Unless we have some form of incentive for people to apply CCS, it’s never going to make sense to make blue hydrogen.” “It does beg the question who’s going to invest in blue hydrogen?” With high capture rates the researchers put the cost of producing blue hydrogen at $2.87 (US$2.09) a kilogram per tonne of CO2, while the cost of producing green hydrogen is $4.99 (US$3.64) with projections that it may come down to $2.55 (US$1.86). As the technology to create blue hydrogen has already been around for some time, it’s unlikely there will be a significant technological advance that would drive down price, as has happened with the production of solar panels. A CSIRO database tracking new hydrogen projects that have been announced or are under development records at least 65 new green hydrogen projects in Australia, compared to just three trying to create hydrogen from fossil fuels and CCS. The ANU research report is supported by other worldwide studies such as one published in September by researchers working for French energy giant Engie who found that it was already possible to produce green hydrogen for similar prices to blue hydrogen. That study found the cost of producing hydrogen from fossil fuels was between $1.34 and $2.40 a kilogram per tonne of CO2, while it was already possible in some operations to produce hydrogen made from solar power at $2.36 a kilogram. Scott Hamilton, a senior adviser to the Smart Energy Council and Hydrogen Australia, said the industry is a “long, long way” from achieving these costs across the board but it was up to the Australian government to actively support the develop of green hydrogen. “The Australian government needs to do more than have hopes and prayers and magical thinking in their modelling,” Hamilton said. “They need proper targets, proper policy actions to bring these emerging technologies to market, as they did with wind and solar 20 years ago.” Hamilton said the government was currently under-pricing blue hydrogen in its net zero modelling by assuming the price of hydrogen produced with fossil fuels to be $1.80 a kilogram, with hydrogen produced through renewable energy only becoming cost-competitive in 2030 – despite the price of natural gas growing steadily since 2015. Dr Madeline Taylor, a senior lecturer at Macquarie University’s school of law and a climate councillor at the Climate Council of Australia, said the ANU research “confirmed the business case, the commercial viability case and the policy case” for green hydrogen. “There’s a lot of money to be made but there’s also a lot of risk if we don’t do it right. If we don’t invest in the right technologies or send the right signals,” Taylor said. “If we don’t think carefully, we could be left with stranded assets. We could be left producing a product the world doesn’t want. We could be left with infrastructure that is going to fall upon the taxpayer to dismantle.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/02/green-energy-refugee-camps-rwanda-solar-panels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-02T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"‘We feel safer’: how green energy is brightening refugee lives in Rwanda","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/02/green-energy-refugee-camps-rwanda-solar-panels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/apr/02/green-energy-refugee-camps-rwanda-solar-panels","fields":{"headline":"‘We feel safer’: how green energy is brightening refugee lives in Rwanda","bodyText":"“The camp has come from the dark into the light,” says Edson Sebutozi Munyakarambi, a refugee living in the Kigeme camp in southern Rwanda. “Before the solar-powered street lamps, the camp was dark. Some people would come and steal things from the houses,” says Munyakarambi, who chairs the committee that represents the 16,000 people in the camp. “But now no one can rob people on the street corners and the children can study or play outside while they wait for their dinner.” The lamps, along with home solar systems and cleaner cooking stoves have been delivered by the Renewable Energy for Refugees (RE4R) project to three camps in Rwanda that house more than 42,000 people. The refugees say the result has been miraculous, making the camps safer and boosting children’s studies and small businesses. In particular, women and children who had to collect firewood outside the camp no longer face the danger of rape and beatings. “Providing sustainable energy to people who have lost almost everything is just so critical,” says Andrew Harper, the special adviser on climate action to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, which runs the camps. “It reduces vulnerability but also brings people back up from a position of disempowerment and dependency to one where they’re starting to contribute back to the community. But it’s an area that is under-prioritised and underfunded in almost every operation.” Uwimana Nyirakabukari, a single mother with five children, lives in the Nyabiheke camp and now has a solar home system: a solar panel on the roof powering lights inside and a battery for charging a mobile phone. “Before this I used candles, or if I could not afford a candle, a burning stick,” she says. “But once, when I went off to the toilets in the night I came back and the mattress had caught fire. My children were about to die.” Fortunately, the fire was extinguished. But the solar lamps have not just reduced the fire risk for Nyirakabukari. “ I can study too,” she says. “I am learning to read and write, and to speak English.” She earns a living by making carrier bags to sell at markets, and having light at home now means she can work in the evening while her older children cook. “The project really helped me escape from poverty,” she adds. Like nearly all the refugees in the three camps, Nyirakabukari fled violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and has large, round scars on her legs where she was shot. The injuries have left her with a physical disability and the street lamps now help her safely navigate the rough paths in the hilly camps. For Esperance Mukabera, another Nyabiheke resident, the radio that is part of the solar home system is key. “Now, I do not feel alone,” says the 75-year-old widow, adding that her grandchildren visit to listen to their favourite shows. “Before [the solar power] it was very hard, the camp was a very dark place. Now we can go to the toilets easily, we feel safer and can move around the camp without any problems,” says Mukabera. Refugee camps are not usually associated with having fun. But it is important for wellbeing, especially for the children who account for half of the refugees at the camps. The solar street lamps have given new life to the Nyabiheke camp’s only basketball court. “The children love it more than you can express,” says Hertier Mugisha, a sports coach who came to the camp as a seven-year-old in 2007. “Before the streetlights we had many people who wanted to come, but the day was not long enough. Now it is open for the time we want.” Sport is also a form of child and youth protection, he says, diverting them from alcohol and other risks. As well as the solar systems, the refugees have been given access to cleaner cooking stoves. These burn pellets made from sawdust and waste wood and remove the dangers of collecting firewood, as well as producing much less smoke. The favourite food of Adeline Umuhoza’s two boys, aged four and eight, is spaghetti and she says the new stove has made a big change to her life in Kigeme. “Our children went to collect firewood outside the camp, but they were scared as local people could beat them,” she says. Smoke and heat from the open fires also filled her home: “You didn’t have any appetite to eat the food you had cooked.” Umuhoza and other refugees not classed as vulnerable pay for their solar systems and cooking stoves in instalments to local companies. “We believe it’s the most sustainable way,” says Denyse Umubyeyi, country manager for Practical Action, the NGO implementing the RE4R project. “It is good for the refugees because when they buy, they feel a kind of ownership, and self-reliance and dignity,” she says. “One refugee told me: ‘What is done for me without me is done against me.’” It also means many more refugees can get the systems than if they were provided for free. Seventy refugees are now employed selling and installing the solar systems. These include Safari Habaruema at the Kigeme camp. Habaruema’s sales pitch is now highly polished: “Having a solar home system really changes a life. I would say get one, and why not a Belecom system?” The RE4R project has delivered 183 streetlights, 4,000 solar home systems and 5,600 stoves across the camps so far, with some also being installed in nearby villages. Involving the host communities is important, says Jost Uwase, of the Rwanda-based EcoGreen Solutions, which has sold more cleaner stoves to local residents than to refugees: “The host community could have said those [refugees] are benefiting while we are starving. But now it’s like they are sharing.” Uwase emphasises the security benefits of the stoves: “There were cases of women being violated when they went outside the camps just collecting firewood in the neighbouring forest, so [the stoves] were an opportunity to keep them safe.” One concern about installing solar devices has been that it may make the camps more permanent. “Some organisations have been reluctant to do such infrastructure,” says Umubyeyi. “But some of these refugees have been here for 20 years. Imagine denying a human being such basic rights for all those years. Their lives have not been put on hold. Their lives go on, they have to grow, to learn, to work.” Habaruema says some people who tried to return to DRC have been killed in the continuing violence. A small number of camps around the world have installed renewable energy systems, including ones established in Jordan for Syrian refugees and in Kenya for Ethiopian refugees. But there are more than 26 million refugees worldwide and, of those living in camps, 90% do not have electricity and 80% rely on firewood for cooking. “Energy is often collecting firewood and that is causing a disaster globally,” says Harper. “If you cannot protect the environment, you cannot protect the community.” Attacks on women are increasing, he says. “As the areas around refugee settlements get more denuded from firewood, they’ve got to go further and further afield.” The climate crisis is also worsening the situation, Harper says. “Often what we’re seeing now is that when people have been forced from their homes due to a combination of conflict, as well as climate change, the potential for people to return becomes really limited [as rising temperatures make traditional farming unviable]. This is why it makes even more sense for us to be investing in longer-term displacement settlements.” Harper believes all refugee camps should have a plan for renewable energy for lighting and cooking, but funding remains a problem. “We have to drive forward the good work that is being done, and move away from pilot projects and implement these activities at the scale of the challenges. But there is a difference between what people deserve and what they get,” he says. That view is shared by Annemieke de Jong of the Ikea Foundation, which funded the €10m (£8.4m) RE4R project. “The challenge lies in scale. Humanitarian aid will always depend on external funding coming in. But what’s exciting is we see opportunities if you approach it as a market and think about what that community needs to grow, to go beyond just that aid economy and have a healthy economy,” she says. The skills that refugees learn through the renewable energy projects can also be taken back with them when they finally return to their country and start rebuilding their communities, De Jong adds. Back in Kigeme, Munyakarambi says the RE4R project has brought a huge positive change, with the only problem being that half of the camp’s residents do not have solar home systems yet. “But we cannot forget we are refugees,” he says. “My wish is to go back to my country. We have a saying: ‘If you visit someone, you have to go back before they get tired of you’. But we have to be sure there is security in Congo.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/mar/28/leading-the-charge-how-the-hospitality-sector-is-building-australias-ev-network","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-03-27T19:00:22Z","webTitle":"Leading the charge: how the hospitality sector is building Australia's EV network","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/28/leading-the-charge-how-the-hospitality-sector-is-building-australias-ev-network","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/mar/28/leading-the-charge-how-the-hospitality-sector-is-building-australias-ev-network","fields":{"headline":"Leading the charge: how the hospitality sector is building Australia's EV network","bodyText":"For David Ritchie, installing three electric car chargers for customers at his winery was a “no-brainer”. With a powerful solar array and storage battery about to come online, visitors to Delatite Wines will soon be able to drive their EVs to the idyllic spot in regional Victoria and enjoy their sampling tour safe in the knowledge that they will be charging their car on free, clean energy for the return journey. Ritchie is one of a growing number of business people pioneering a wave of eco-tourism based around the availability of EV chargers. Instead of enduring what could be a long wait for the Coalition government to join the green energy revolution, hotels, motels, Airbnb hosts and other hospitality operators like Ritchie are stepping up and delivering a micro EV charging network for Australia. For the relatively small outlay of a few thousand dollars, Ritchie hopes that the chargers will put his winery at Mansfield on maps and apps such as Plugshare, used by EV drivers to navigate their way around the country. “We had Tesla chargers but not that many people drive a Tesla because they’re expensive, so we decided to put chargers in that can be used by all types of cars,” says Ritchie, who produces between 12-14,000 dozen bottles of red, white and sparkling wine a year. “It’s a great service for people because there isn’t a charger for miles around, and it’s a way of drawing people in to the winery. It also costs next to nothing and we will give it for free. To me it’s a no-brainer.” The chargers that Ritchie and businesses like his are choosing to install are AC, or alternate current chargers, which typically take a couple of hours to give vehicles a top-up. There are now almost 2,000 of them across Australia and, augmented by more than 350 of the much faster DC, or direct current, public chargers, they cater to the nation’s 20,000-plus fleet of EVs – almost half of which have been added in the past 12 months. Although fast chargers can power up a battery in a matter of minutes, they are much more expensive to install – around $30,000 as opposed to $2,000 for the ACs. This makes the latter perfectly suited to a micro-economic model. Russ Shepherd is the founder of EVolution, a Melbourne-based company that provides and installs chargers. The company has a fast-charging station in Oakley but it is a promotional tool rather than a money-maker, so the easiest commercial proposition is installing AC chargers in homes and businesses. “We have a lot of interest in this at the moment,” he says. “The return on investment for public chargers is quite low, especially if places like shopping centres are offering free power.” It is challenging for corporate investors to justify the cost of land and installation of a network of DC chargers, especially since the payment mechanisms in chargers is an expensive add-on cost. So it makes more sense to make them free, or with an honesty box. “Drivers will go to a particular location with chargers over somewhere with no chargers,” Shepherd says. “We have lots of examples where hotels put chargers in and they get calls from drivers straight away wanting to check in. We’ve found it a relatively easy sell and it’s a very low-cost boost for local businesses and communities.” But it’s not just small businesses that can benefit. Shepherd says EV owners quickly change their behaviour depending on where they can get a top-up. For example, they have evidence from market research and from customer feedback that a Westfield in Woden in the ACT that is fitted with chargers is being favoured by EV drivers over another nearby Westfield at Belconnen. The other piece of evidence is that the Belconnen centre has been in touch with EVolution about having chargers installed so its customers can also shop, eat or watch a movie while their car charges. Cameron Craig, digital marketing executive at Sydney-based charging company EVSE, has noticed the same pattern, hinting that while the rollout of fast-charging networks by Chargefox and the NRMA is very welcome, the future might be found closer to home. “Malls are getting charging stations but they are not necessarily looking to make money. They want to attract wealthier customers because they are more likely to be EV drivers,” he says. As for an Airbnb-style network where “plug hosts” could charge for top-ups, he thinks the economics make it unlikely. “It’s definitely possible to set up your own home-based system but electricity is not so cheap that you can make much money from it,” Craig says. “It’s not commercially viable so you’ve got to look at five to 10 chargers and people won’t have that space. You’re only going to see that scale through council developments and apartment blocks.” Rob Nicholls, associate professor at the University of New South Wales business school, says Australia is ripe for the micro-charging revolution. Even though the country has one of the lowest take-ups of EVs in the developed world and the industry lacks the kind of generous subsidies offered overseas, such as in the UK or Germany, Australian homes have the highest proportion of solar power in the world. It’s then natural to move from solar power to having a battery, and then to find a use for that electricity. “What’s the next thing?” Nicholls asks. “It’s to think about getting a battery to stabilise that solar and reduce costs”, which might in turn mean that people buy an EV to soak up that power. Domestic storage batteries can come in at $10,000, and although new EVs are still relatively expensive, Shepherd says you can pick up secondhand ones for $20,000. Back in Mansfield, Ritchie of Delatite Wines is looking forward to firing up his new solar network in mid-May. He hopes that it will soon be powering a stream of visiting EVs, while their owners enjoy a refurbished kitchen and cellar door that will also be running off the solar power. He also hopes that the farm’s vehicles will soon be solar-powered. “We have two electric-powered ATVs [all-terrain vehicles] at the moment,” he says. “But as soon as we can get an electric tractor, we will get one. And as soon as I can get an electric ute, I will get one and get rid of my diesel one. With the customer chargers, it all fits with our brand and philosophy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/jun/02/energy-firms-urged-to-mothball-coal-plants-as-cost-of-solar-tumbles","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-02T08:29:00Z","webTitle":"Energy firms urged to mothball coal plants as cost of solar tumbles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/02/energy-firms-urged-to-mothball-coal-plants-as-cost-of-solar-tumbles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/jun/02/energy-firms-urged-to-mothball-coal-plants-as-cost-of-solar-tumbles","fields":{"headline":"Energy firms urged to mothball coal plants as cost of solar tumbles","bodyText":"Building new solar power projects would generate cheaper electricity than running most of the world’s existing coal power plants, according to a global renewable energy report. New figures have revealed that more than half of the world’s coal plants could be undercut by the falling cost of new large-scale solar projects, which are now more than 80% cheaper to build than in 2010. The International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) has found that up to 1,200 gigawatts of the world’s existing coal capacity could cost more to run than the cost of new utility-scale solar plants. If energy companies replaced only their most expensive coal plants with new solar power projects or onshore wind farms, totalling 500 GW globally, they could save up to $23bn (£18bn) every year and wipe out 5% of last year’s total global carbon emissions, according to Irena. This global renewable energy boom would also stimulate $940bn in investment, or the equivalent of 1% of global GDP, as the world emerges from the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis. Francesco La Camera, the director-general of Irena, said renewable energy is “increasingly the cheapest source of new electricity” and offers “tremendous potential to stimulate the global economy and get people back to work”. In under a decade the cost of large-scale solar power has fallen by more than 80% while onshore wind has fallen by almost 40% and offshore wind has declined by almost 30%. Irena’s latest figures have revealed that costs are continuing to fall. The cost of large-scale solar power fell 13% last year to a global average of 6.8 US cents per kilowatt hour, while onshore and offshore wind costs both fell by about 9% to 5.3 cents per kWh and 11.5 cents per kWh respectively. “Renewable investments are stable, cost-effective and attractive, offering consistent and predictable returns while delivering benefits to the wider economy. A global recovery strategy must be a green strategy,” La Camera said. Irena has found that increasing investment in renewable energy could generate major economic benefits and spark global GDP gains of almost $100tn between now and 2050. “Renewables offer a way to align short-term policy action with medium- and long-term energy and climate goals. Renewables must be the backbone of national efforts to restart economies in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. With the right policies in place, falling renewable power costs can shift markets and contribute greatly towards a green recovery,” said La Camera."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/oct/22/climate-crisis-global-councils-local-clean-energy-housing","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-22T07:00:29Z","webTitle":"The climate crisis is global, but councils can offer local solutions | Stephen Smellie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/22/climate-crisis-global-councils-local-clean-energy-housing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/22/climate-crisis-global-councils-local-clean-energy-housing","fields":{"headline":"The climate crisis is global, but councils can offer local solutions","bodyText":"At Cop26 this year, we’ll hear about diplomats and heads of state negotiating over targets, but when a river bank bursts or a storm hits, it’s our local councils that are left to clear up the mess. When Storm Frank lashed the north-east of Scotland over the new year of 2016, it was council binmen, engineers, housing officers, social workers and home carers who worked day and night mobilising volunteers to evacuate homes and find temporary accommodation for some 300 households. In the weeks and months afterwards, Aberdeenshire council had to deal with a mile stretch of destroyed road, three washed-away footbridges, and damage to several bridges. This is on top of the clean-up operation and returning families to their homes. Despite financial assistance from the Scottish government, the council was left with a bill of around £15m. This is the less glamorous, but very real work, that goes into responding to climate change. As we look to the future, the task facing council workers like me is to think how we make our homes and neighbourhoods more sustainable and more resilient, and maybe even fairer along the way. Starting with our homes, badly insulated housing is responsible for 14% of the UK’s total emissions. It’s a real challenge to retrofit houses and other buildings so that energy is not leaking through roofs and walls. Leaving this to individual homeowners and landlords will result in a disparity between rich people, who can afford cavity wall and roof insulation, and poor people, who will freeze in poorly insulated homes when left unable to meet rising heating bills. Councils are ideally placed to coordinate social housing resources, while in turn benefiting other households. Local authorities who have retained in-house maintenance teams could retrofit their own buildings – but also, through the enormous efficiencies of scale that a cross-sector project would bring, reduce the cost of making homes fuel-efficient and warm for all other property owners. If you’re going to put scaffolding up to retrofit one house, it’s cheaper to do the house next door at the same time. At the same time, councils would be reskilling their own workforce, while creating industry-standard apprenticeship schemes. These would train young people in the skills needed to succeed in the green economy. At the community level, councils themselves are enormous users of energy, from lighting the streets to heating buildings and running fleets of vehicles, so they face a challenge in reducing their own reliance on fossil fuels. However, councils can be a key agent in addressing this. Local councils could become generators of renewable energy, using council land and buildings to generate wind and solar power for their own and the wider community’s use. This could address issues of fuel poverty within their areas, at a time when the share of household budgets being spent on heating is on the rise. There are costs involved in setting up such schemes, but the benefits would be produced quickly. Such municipal energy projects could act as a spur to public sector partners, linking community and commercial energy projects into councils’ schemes through local renewable energy grids, avoiding the high cost of relaying energy long distance through the National Grid. With every roof fitted with solar panels, and wind turbines installed on appropriate council land, communities come closer to achieving energy self-sufficiency – an aim attainable within a couple of decades. The benefit could be amplified if these schemes are connected to procurement policies that support nearby businesses. For example, the Community Wealth Building strategy, launched last year by North Ayrshire council, ensures that much more council spending is retained in the local area. Of course, to initiate these schemes, councils require government investment. But many of these schemes will repay that investment over a period of 10 to 15 years, through savings on energy bills, the benefits of reducing fuel poverty and an improved local economy. Councils will need to identify the skills required to make this transition, while also recognising that some workers need to be retrained. There will be few jobs for diesel truck mechanics when council fleets switch to electrical or green hydrogen vehicles. As future social housing is built with electrical or pump storage heating, the gas fitters and maintenance teams will need to learn new skills. By working with their employees and trade unions, councils can ensure that these transitions are fair to the current workforce, tenants, service users and council taxpayers. With the right national government support and planning, councils can use their economic power as major employers as well as owners of infrastructure, property and land, and procurers of goods and services, to be the agents of genuinely just transitions. • Stephen Smellie has worked for his local council for nearly 40 years in community development and training and is currently secretary of Unison’s South Lanarkshire branch"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/27/leaked-us-leaked-power-companies-spending-profits-stop-clean-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T11:00:17Z","webTitle":"Leaked: US power companies secretly spending millions to protect profits and fight clean energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/27/leaked-us-leaked-power-companies-spending-profits-stop-clean-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/27/leaked-us-leaked-power-companies-spending-profits-stop-clean-energy","fields":{"headline":"Leaked: US power companies secretly spending millions to protect profits and fight clean energy","bodyText":"The CEO of the biggest power company in the US had a problem. A Democratic state senator was proposing a law that could cut into Florida Power &amp; Light’s (FPL) profits. Landlords would be able to sell cheap rooftop solar power directly to their tenants – bypassing FPL and its monopoly on electricity. “I want you to make his life a living hell … seriously,” FPL’s CEO Eric Silagy wrote in a 2019 email to two of his vice-presidents about state Senator José Javier Rodríguez, who proposed the legislation. Within minutes, one of them forwarded the directive to the CEO of Matrix, LLC, a powerful but little-known political consulting firm that has operated behind the scenes in at least eight states. Rodríguez was ousted from office in the next election. Matrix employees spent heavily on political advertisements for a candidate with the same last name as Rodríguez, who split the vote. That candidate later admitted he was bribed to run. Hundreds of pages of internal documents – which are only coming to light now because Matrix’s founders are locked in an epic feud – detail the firm’s secret work to help power companies like FPL protect their profits and fight the transition to cleaner forms of energy. The Matrix saga illustrates the political obstacles policymakers and experts face as they attempt to cut climate pollution from the power sector, one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors in the US. The ongoing clash between Matrix’s founder Joe Perkins, 72, and former CEO Jeff Pitts, 51, is exposing the firm’s decades of extensive influence peddling on behalf of utility clients. The issue extends to several states. Records obtained by Floodlight and the Orlando Sentinel show that Matrix consulted for FPL, as well as another Florida company, Gulf Power, and Alabama Power. Matrix affiliated groups have also worked to advance power companies’ interests in Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and in front of the Environmental Protection Agency, public records show. In Florida, Matrix’s work touched almost every level of politics, from influencing local mayoral and county commission elections to combating attempts to reshape the state constitution. In each of those cases, Matrix was working against politicians or policies fighting to curb the climate crisis by encouraging renewable power. Matrix employees had a Jacksonville journalist spied on after he wrote critically about FPL. And in 2020, Matrix even harnessed the power of the press for itself, when its employees acquired control of The Capitolist, a Tallahassee-based political news site which it used for favorable coverage, leaked records show. “I find this to be horrifying and undemocratic,” said Gianna Trocino Bonner, former chief legislative aide for Rodríguez, after reviewing some of the leaked documents. “It’s unfortunate that our process allows for something like this to exist without accountability.” Big power companies operate as monopolies with captive customers in much of the south-east US. They are supposed to be closely regulated, but their profits and unchecked political spending makes them some of the most powerful entities in a state. Howard Crystal, an attorney for the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity, said that US utilities are allowed monopoly power “because they are supposed to expand the public interest. “[But] now we have this incredible corruption and a reversal of that because they are using their advantage to hang on to power and undermine democracy,” he said. So far, there have been two criminal investigations into the campaign against Rodríguez and another Democratic state senate candidate, leading to charges against five people, though authorities have not accused Matrix or FPL of wrongdoing. Matrix’s principal, Perkins, says he discovered only after Pitts left the firm that he and other now-former employees had been conducting “shadow activities and operations” dating back to 2016. He is suing Pitts in Alabama for fraud and conspiracy. “For many years and without my knowledge or approval, Pitts abused his power and position to benefit himself and his cronies,” Perkins said in a statement. “Upon realizing the extent of Pitts’s shadow operations and abuses of power, we filed our lawsuit against Pitts and those few rogue employees.” Pitts, who left Matrix in December 2020 to start his own firm, Canopy Partners, did not respond to a request for comment by deadline. He is also suing Perkins, alleging defamation and extortion. A spokesperson for FPL said it stopped working with Canopy in late 2021. FPL’s CEO Silagy in a recent interview denied knowing about or participating in the scheme against Rodríguez but said that Matrix had done “good work” for his company. Records show FPL trusted Matrix operatives with millions, including giving $14m to a single Matrix-run nonprofit in 2018 alone. Silagy said the email in which he told his team to make Rodríguez’s life “a living hell” was “a poor choice of words”. Digging for dirt In Florida, FPL and Matrix demonstrated how a utility and its consultants can work in tandem to resist clean energy reforms. FPL deployed lobbyists to the capital, while Matrix hired private investigators to dig for dirt and had operatives funnel dark money and order attack ads. Few examples are clearer than the case of South Miami. When the small south Florida city’s mayor helped pass an ordinance in 2017 mandating rooftop solar panels on new construction, a network of 10 FPL-aligned operatives mobilized to ensure his ouster. The team decided an effort to repeal the ordinance would probably fail. So they opted instead for “Mayor Stoddard’s electoral defeat and changing the makeup of the board”, according to a 2018 memo from Dan Newman, a Matrix contractor who was similarly involved in the campaign against Rodríguez. Along with a private investigator, the group delved into Stoddard’s past for episodes to weaponize against him, such as a South Miami commissioner’s claim on Facebook that Stoddard had forcibly kissed her. Documents show Matrix operatives arranged for the commissioner to record a robocall in which she called Stoddard “a creep”. Pitts at the time forwarded a draft of the script to two FPL executives. Newman in his memo also took credit for a Miami Herald story about the allegation. Meanwhile, Matrix-led non-profits funded a blizzard of ads against Stoddard, accusing him of using public money for “vendettas” and placing him alongside infamous sex offenders Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein. The plan ultimately failed, and Stoddard was re-elected. He has denied the allegations. “An organization that acts like a mafia should be treated like one,” Stoddard said. In a statement, Newman acknowledged managing the campaign against Stoddard and hiring a private investigator to look into the former mayor’s personal life. He said what he found was “deeply disturbing”. FPL did not respond to requests for comment by deadline. Matrix’s influence was felt on matters small and large, from Stoddard’s city of less than 12,000 to statewide fights over the Florida constitution. In 2019, when the electric utility industry was up in arms about a constitutional amendment to open up competition in Florida’s energy market, a Matrix-linked non-profit poured more than $10m into groups fighting it. Matrix also exerted political influence through the press, with its operatives acquiring control of a Tallahassee-based politics news site, The Capitolist. That gave Matrix consultants and FPL executives input on Capitolist stories. The site’s publisher, Brian Burgess, a former top spokesperson for past Florida governor Rick Scott, also suggested in emails that Matrix should lure prominent Florida journalists to a new site or buy local papers owned by media giant Gannett Company and then lay off most of the “clown reporters” to “inject content” into publications without anyone knowing who was “pulling the strings”. That proposal was forwarded to Silagy at FPL but never came to fruition. Burgess said he “never pitched nor solicited feedback from FPL executives on any story or business venture”, and FPL spokesperson Chris McGrath said acquiring a news organization would not have made sense as a business deal for FPL. *** Headquartered in Montgomery, Matrix has been described there as “the closest thing Alabama politics has to a non-governmental secret agency”. Perkins and Pitts worked together for more than 25 years, expanding the firm into a national operation with dozens of clients in myriad industries. But wherever the pair went, indictments often followed. An Alabama governor the company worked for was convicted of federal felony corruption charges. A Birmingham mayor who employed Matrix got 15 years for bribery, conspiracy and fraud. And a former regional administrator for the EPA who did business with Pitts pleaded guilty to violating state ethics law multiple times. From the beginning, Matrix showed no aversion to unsavory political tactics. In 1998, the firm distributed copies of a video in which a sex worker falsely alleged she had been sexually assaulted by a candidate for lieutenant governor. The sex worker later testified the allegations were untrue, and that she had been paid by a Birmingham businessman to make them. In 2015, Matrix distributed fliers for a suspicious charity in a predominantly Black neighborhood in North Birmingham. The fliers warned residents not to let the Environmental Protection Agency test their soil for the presence of contaminants left by a coal plant. The charity was a front established by a state representative. A local law firm and the company that owned the coal plant used the charity to pay the representative. Three people were federally convicted for their role in the ploy. Matrix was never accused of wrongdoing. One of Matrix’s oldest clients is Alabama Power, which employed Perkins’ personal consulting firm as early as 1999. In 2018, Perkins Communications received at least $1.49m from Alabama Power, a leaked contract shows. Those who provoked the utility’s ire suffered a harsh response. In 2013, Terry Dunn, a Republican electricity regulator at Alabama’s Public Service Commission made moves to hold formal hearings on how customers’ energy bills were calculated – something that hadn’t happened in three decades. Customers at the time were paying some of the highest rates for electricity in the south-east. Soon, Dunn faced attacks in the rightwing press and online, while Matrix-affiliated groups – some of which received millions from a non-profit run by a contractor for Alabama Power – filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings. Meanwhile, groups aligned with the utility falsely tied Dunn to the Obama administration’s efforts to reduce the use of coal. The tactics worked. Dunn lost his 2014 re-election campaign by a 19-point margin to Chip Beeker, a catfish farmer who is still in office. Months after he was elected, Beeker voted in favor of an energy price hike for consumers. Alabama Power still hasn’t had a rate case. “Southern Company and Alabama Power run the state of Alabama,” Dunn said. “They work off intimidating. You gotta bow down and kiss the ring.” A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on the firm’s activities. Perkins called Matrix’s work for the utility “confidential”. Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard Law School said the “whole purpose” of firms like Matrix “is to conceal that it’s the utility doing this. The utility doesn’t want to be associated with this campaign.” Things start going ‘sideways’ Matrix grew so large that by 2015 it was operating several private aircraft to whisk Pitts and Perkins to client meetings. Flight data shows Matrix’s planes made more than 130 flights to five states in 2020 alone, frequently crisscrossing the south-eastern US but also traveling as far west as New Mexico. In Perkins’ telling, he was getting ready to hand over leadership of Matrix in December 2020 when Pitts surprised him by leaving the firm, taking three employees – as well as most of Matrix’s Florida-based clients – with him to launch Canopy. At the Birmingham office where Pitts and the others had worked, Perkins said he found a backup server that “appeared to have been beaten with something”. The firm later recovered more than a million files, according to Perkins, who said they reveal years of hidden, “shadow work” in Florida. Perkins and Pitts sued each other, with Pitts claiming his former mentor had “never followed through” on handing over the company despite years of discussions. Once he left, Pitts said Perkins smeared him to clients in an attempt to extort millions. As their feud escalated, internal documents started to arrive in reporters’ email inboxes from unknown sources. Many of the documents have since been verified by additional reporting, public records or Perkins himself. Silagy, the FPL CEO, says the pair initially told him they had come to an amicable agreement about parting ways. He says he told them that he was disappointed, but there was enough work for both of them, “based on the good work they had done”. “And then apparently, somewhere along the way, Jeff and Joe got sideways,” Silagy said.

They are wrong. Even before the tragedy of Ukraine, poll after poll showed that most people want to be kind and decent to those seeking refuge. But Johnson and Patel pay attention only to that minority who don’t. And whip them up. In my own small town of Hastings, local refugee support groups have a strong presence, and collectively many thousands of followers on social media. When tiny boats crammed with desperate refugees arrived on our beaches a few months ago, there was an outpouring of support, including over £34,000 collected in a few days in hundreds of donations by local people. The response to the people now fleeing the tragedy in Ukraine is similarly powerful. Over 1,260 have signed a petition to our MP urging her to oppose the nationality and borders bill and vote for the Lords’ amendments which threw out so many of its iniquities. On the streets, in the pubs, the cafes, the churches, we find an empathy that far outweighs the repulsive narrative so mendaciously claimed as what “the British people want”. A few days ago, a local fisherman told me that he had been instructed by Border Force to report any dinghies in the Channel but to let them drift. “I’m not doing that!” he declared. “On sea, no matter who it is, no matter where they come from or why, everyone is my responsibility – let them drift? Hah!” We are desperate to be listened to by our own parliamentary representative, a fellow party member with Patel and Johnson. Patel and Johnson may lack any smidgen of the imaginative capacity needed to empathise with our fellow humans who are fleeing for their lives – but most of the rest of us are better than that. Felicity Laurence Hastings, East Sussex Why museums matter The headline of your article gave the impression that museums are failing to make any difference to the lives of pupils (“Why a day out at the museum won’t result in better exam grades”, News). Nothing could be further from the truth – museums across the UK worked hard throughout the pandemic to ensure that children had access to engaging experiences of culture, art, science and history. These experiences are not designed to help children pass specific exams, but to contribute to their wider development and understanding of the world. As your article recognises, there are numerous other recent studies that demonstrate the broader development and wellbeing benefits that museum visits can bring. Museums are brilliant places for discovering who we are, where we have come from and what we might become. There is no exam for that.

It is irritating to read that “the Jeremy Corbyn years (were) a disastrous period for the Labour party”, with no qualification or analysis of whether that was actually the case. In 2017, Theresa May was expected to increase her majority; instead, Labour demolished it, winning over 40% of the vote for the first time in decades. Corbyn was able to communicate Labour’s optimistic and transformative agenda precisely because so few figures in the mainstream press believed he was a serious contender. The result appeared to terrify liberal and conservative journalists alike, who spent the next two years recasting Corbyn as some sort of folk devil, even as Labour party membership rose to over 560,000 and its MPs enjoyed the fruits of their – temporarily – vastly increased majorities. Their efforts made a substantive contribution to the genuine disaster of the 2019 election. I was and remain agnostic about Corbyn himself, believing him to be temperamentally unsuited to the role of party leader. What his leadership represented, however, was something entirely different: a genuine belief in the capacities and capabilities of ordinary people, to which millions of voters responded in kind. If that’s a disaster, I don’t know what success is. Lynsey Hanley Liverpool Sustainability, not shiny toys While I agree with Will Hutton on the need for a swift transition to renewables, having spent the last 20 years working as an engineer in the space sector, I have my doubts that beaming microwave solar power to Earth from space can ever be part of the solution (“Warmed-up Thatcherism was never going to be the answer. Now it would be a disaster”, Comment). Can you imagine the planning process? How does “Residents object to plans for death ray from the skies” sound as a headline in the local paper? And that’s before we get to energy security: what exactly will we do when a hostile power’s satellite “accidentally” collides with our orbiting power station, and how to fix it when it goes wrong? But what is most frustrating is the unchallenged techno-utopianism underpinning much of the talk of net zero. We are constantly grasping for the next shiny toy, betting the farm (and our children’s futures) on the off-chance that yet more marginal gains and elaborate schemes will keep pace with our ever-growing appetites. Where in all this is the discussion of reducing demand, or an honest appraisal of how to live sustainably on a single planet with finite resources too much for us to face? Kevin Middleton Stanford in the Vale, Faringdon, Berkshire Don’t focus on phones It is astonishing to see the chair of the social mobility commission, Katharine Birbalsingh, claim “it all starts with smartphones” (“Take away children’s phones to boost social mobility”, News). The past decade has seen the devastation of Sure Start children’s centres, a squeeze on education spending that has hit the most disadvantaged areas hardest, and steep cuts to social security benefits that have increased child poverty. Each of these factors will have damaged social mobility. Focusing on smartphones falls into a long tradition of blaming individual behaviour to distract attention from deep structural inequalities. The commission is supposed to hold government to account on its actions. It is not hard to see why Birbalsingh was the government’s choice as chair. Dr Kitty Stewart Associate professor, Department of Social Policy, Associate Director, Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion, London School of Economics and Political Science, London WC2 All Russians are not Putin Hans Kundnani’s article makes the crucial distinction between Vladimir Putin and the Russian people (“First, we did too little to oppose Russia. Now do we risk going too far the other way?”, Comment). We must not make the mistake a second time of failing to respect and work with the Russian people after Putin’s inevitable fall. The “west” – including particularly the United States – erred the first time by failing to support Mikhail Gorbachev and thus enabling him to achieve a far more gentle and constructive breakup of the Soviet Union. The cataclysmic implosion it suffered fatally destroyed Gorbachev’s credibility and contributed significantly to the estrangement of Russia from the west. Disastrously, the United States, abetted by other western governments, encouraged exploitative capitalism to feed off the fall of the Soviet Union and it was this that produced the oligarchs who quickly grasped the sale of state assets. The collapse of the rouble in 1998 was the final straw, not least as it caused increased poverty among millions of Russians. They blamed Gorbachev and his successor Boris Yeltsin and, instead of following democracy, they looked for a strong nationalist leader – and there was Putin waiting in the wings. Putin is very much the collateral damage of the west’s mistakes. The Russian people rightly have great pride in their culture, much of which in its music, its opera, its ballet and even its literature, is European. We must constantly make the point that we also recognise Russian culture and draw Russia after Putin into a closer relationship. Michael Meadowcroft Leeds Your news article states that “Russians over 65 are 51% more likely to watch television than under-25s” (“Moscow’s family divide”). This still leaves 49% of over-65s who aren’t more likely to watch television, and not all of the 51% are swallowing the propaganda. Russian blogger Ilya Krasilshchik’s 110,000 followers does not constitute a major proportional ratio of a vast country to endorse the impression in your article that older Russians are pro-war in the Ukraine.

Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema present the last hurdle to the US president’s social spending and climate package after it was passed by Democrats in the House of Representatives earlier this month. Having already pressured colleagues to cut the cost of the Build Back Better plan in half, the conservative duo continue to raise concerns about its $1.75tn price tag and sprawling ambition. Manchin and Sinema’s status as holdouts in a Senate evenly divided between 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans has guaranteed outsized influence and attention. It also appears to be lucrative. In September, Sinema received a cheque from Stanley Hubbard, a billionaire Republican donor who is considering a similar contribution to Manchin because of their work to reduce the bill’s price tag, the New York Times reported this week. “Those are two good people – Manchin and Sinema – and I think we need more of those in the Democratic party,” Hubbard was quoted as saying. The newspaper also revealed Manchin, of West Virginia, and Sinema, of Arizona, travelled to an $18m mansion in Dallas for a summer fundraiser attended by Republican and big business donors who have praised their efforts to pare down the Build Back Better bill. Manchin, for example, opposed popular provisions such as paid family leave and a clean electricity programme that would boost wind and solar power while phasing out coal and gas, while Sinema rejected an increase of personal and corporate income tax rates. Their stances have not gone unnoticed by Wall Street and wealthy conservatives. The $3.3m raised by Manchin’s campaign in the first nine months of this year was more than 14 times his haul at the equivalent stage last year, the New York Times added, while the $2.6m taken in by Sinema’s campaign was two and a half times what she netted over the same period in 2020. Such sums, which include contributions from political action committees and donors linked to the finance and pharmaceutical industries, have raised ethical concerns over whether Democrats Manchin and Sinema are being unduly influenced. Kyle Herrig, president of Accountable.US, a non-partisan watchdog that targets government corruption, said: “What else but industry money could explain the manufactured excuses for resisting Build Back Better considering it remains extremely popular, is fully paid for, and would cut costs and taxes for most everyday people in Arizona and West Virginia? “Corporate interests and billionaires have done very well even during the pandemic and don’t need more special treatment. Senators Sinema and Manchin have a chance they may not get again to help so many regular families and seniors get ahead for a change, so why squander it over complaints from a handful of rich interests that exploit tax loopholes and ship jobs overseas?” Accountable.US said its own tracking of corporate activity found that Manchin had taken more than $1.5m and Sinema nearly $1m from corporate interests opposed to the Build Back Better plan as of September. It added that Sinema abandoned prior support for lowering prescription drug prices after a deluge of money from the pharmaceutical industry in the third quarter. Such patterns have angered grassroots activists who say Sinema’s positions are out of sync with the stated needs and views of her own constituents in Arizona. Stephany Spaulding, a spokesperson for Just Democracy, a coalition of more than 40 civil rights and social justice groups, said in response to the New York Times article: “Senator Sinema’s approval ratings among her base have plummeted in recent months and this donor report shows why. She’s busy chasing out-of-state corporate dollars instead of fighting for her constituents’ needs. “Crucial policies like infrastructure, Build Back Better, Medicaid expansion and voting rights are all incredibly popular, but once again she’s demonstrated how frail her commitment to Black and brown Arizonans is.” The House approved the Build Back Better legislation 220-213 as every Democrat but one backed it, overcoming unanimous Republican opposition. After a brief Thanksgiving hiatus it heads to the Senate, where changes are certain as moderates and progressives wrangle over its cost and scope. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, told reporters on Sunday: “The House did a very strong bill. Everyone knows that Manchin and Sinema have their concerns, but we’re going to try to negotiate with them and get a very strong, bold bill out of the Senate which will then go back to the House and pass.” Manchin is facing pressure to support a provision that would grant four weeks of paid family and medical leave, bringing America into alignment with most western industrial democracies. Sinema’s priorities and red lines have been harder to discern, a source of frustration in its own right. Some observers were unsurprised that the senators are attracting cash from the right. Jordan Libowitz, communications director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), said: “It’s not unusual for megadonors to occasionally cross party lines with their donations. For some, this is hedging their bets, for others, rewarding a politician who came through on an issue they care about. “Ultimately, money follows power. Manchin and Sinema look to be the deciding votes on major legislation, so it really isn’t surprising that people from the other side of the aisle will be trying to win influence with them.” But others described it as an indictment of the influence of money in politics. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “It’s an outrage. Candidates are in such a hunger for amassing large campaign war chests that they’re going to provide privileged access to the very interests are supposed to be regulating.” He added: “The appearance of what’s going on here – lavish public fundraising events – is a dagger through the trust and legitimacy of American democracy. It just captures the worst fears that Americans have that politicians are up for sale. And I think that public perception is toxic.” Manchin and Sinema’s offices did not respond to requests for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2021/dec/16/go-easy-on-me-why-pop-has-got-so-predictable","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-16T17:05:01Z","webTitle":"Go easy on me: why pop has got so predictable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/16/go-easy-on-me-why-pop-has-got-so-predictable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2021/dec/16/go-easy-on-me-why-pop-has-got-so-predictable","fields":{"headline":"Go easy on me: why pop has got so predictable","bodyText":"The biggest album launch of 2021 began with a social media statement tacitly assuring fans that nothing had changed. Adele was once more in a state of heartbreak – “a maze of absolute mess and inner turmoil … consumed by my own grief” – and that the contents of her album 30 would reflect that, as mired in romantic misery as its predecessors, 25 and 21. It was the musical equivalent, she said, of a friend who comes over “with a bottle of wine and a takeaway” to discuss the disastrous state of your love life. The second-biggest album launch of 2021 was preceded by its creators proudly announcing they had written it “absolutely trend-blind”. Abba had traversed a considerable musical distance over the course of their original career, buffeted by the shifting musical trends of the 70s and early 80s – from the clompy Europop of their debut album to the sophisticated, chilly electronics of The Visitors, by way of glam and sleek disco – but Voyage would offer them preserved in amber, exactly as they were in the late 70s, unspoiled by any musical trends from the 40 years since their split. Elsewhere, Ed Sheeran’s fourth solo album = was not built to startle fans or cause detractors to reconsider their position – whatever you already thought of him, positive or negative, you could find evidence to support your view – and Lana Del Rey released not one but two albums that, like every Lana Del Rey album, consisted of variations on the same theme. More morose, glacial ballads, more ne’er-do-well boyfriends who “never give nothing back”, more ruminations on the dark side of fame, more musical evidence of her love of Mazzy Star, more lyrical assurances that its author is a bad girl. You could construct an argument that she has honed her aesthetic over the last decade, but she’s certainly not dramatically overhauled it. And then there was Drake’s Certified Lover Boy, as one critic put it, “an 86-minute omnibus of all things Drake”. The listener confronted with its stew of self-pity, braggadocio, passive-aggression and solipsism could have complained that we had been here before, many times, over the course of Drake’s career, but there didn’t seem to be many dissatisfied customers: the album broke first-day streaming records on both Apple Music and Spotify. There was a time when artists who wilfully repeated themselves were the subject of mockery – think of all the jokes aimed Status Quo’s way in the late 70s and 80s, and the snarky comparisons to Status Quo lobbed at Oasis once Britpop’s shine wore off – or when continually doing the same thing was a sure-fire way to truncate your career. You didn’t have to be David Bowie or Prince, constantly reinventing yourself in such dramatic style that you were bound to shed at least a few puzzled fans along the way, but if you simply dealt in more of the same, audiences would realise your limitations had been reached and move on to something else. In 2021, however, it frequently felt as if the best way to maintain one’s place at the pinnacle of pop was by doing exactly what audiences expected them to. Certainly, one of the factors in the relatively muted response to another of 2021’s hotly anticipated albums, Billie Eilish’s Happier Than Ever, seemed to be that it shifted from the blueprint established on its predecessors: the hoodie-clad teenage goth who made them replaced by a blonde vamp posing for Vogue in an Alexander McQueen corset; the trap-influenced bangers that had populated 2019’s multi-platinum When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? were now mostly absent. Moreover, you got the feeling that Eilish had done it deliberately, keen to calm down the hysteria that, judging by the album’s lyrics, had made her life a misery. She had realised that, in the current climate, just altering her approach slightly – it was hardly a completely confounding, who-is-this? reinvention – would do the trick. Meanwhile, Lorde’s also highly anticipated third album Solar Power – another retreat from stardom and angst, this time into benign sun-worshipping pop and homespun wisdom – sank without trace. Why has the predictable become a preference? One theory is that it’s linked to the turbulence of modern times. In a year that began with the storming of the Capitol and ended with the Omicron variant, the wider world provided more than enough shocks: perhaps what people want from pop music is reassurance and comfort rather than startling novelty. Another is that it has something to do with the oft-mentioned desire for a kind of putative “authenticity” in pop music. We are always hearing about how important it is for 21st-century artists to appear #relatable, something that is certainly central to the success of Adele andSheeran, as well as Drake’s whole I’m-a-multi-millionaire-playa-but-I’m-sad-too shtick and Lana Del Rey’s dogged, angry insistence that she is not inhabiting a Ziggy Stardust-ish character, but writing about herself. How #relatable can an artist be if they keep changing all the time, if the music you #related to suddenly becomes different? Or perhaps it has more to do with the shifts in the way we consume music. Before the internet, pop existed in a relatively small, heavily curated space, bounded by radio, whatever TV shows featured it and the music press: comparatively few artists broke into it, so audiences expected those that did to keep things fresh by regularly altering their approach. Now the opposite is true. We live in a madly diverse, globalised media climate. The sheer availability and abundance of music is overwhelming: 60,000 new tracks are added to Spotify alone every day, and the number of sources from which we can access music at the touch of a button (TikTok, Bandcamp) is constantly expanding. The stylistic and generic boundaries and striking, short-circuiting shifts in taste that once informed pop music’s progress – the rise of punk, or electronic pop, the dramatic flowering of hip-hop, the arrival of acid house – increasingly seem like a thing of the past. The chaotic recombinations of hyperpop or the thrilling propulsion of drill show that there is still innovation at pop’s fringes. But in a crowded, confusing market, in which music fans act as their own curators, cherrypicking from a vast variety of sources, it is more important than it once was for big artists to maintain an immediately recognisable sonic brand. If that is the case, then this isn’t a trend or an example of failing inspiration – it’s the way things are, and are likely to stay. If you want to get to the top of pop, you will have minimal room for manoeuvre if you want to stay there."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2019/jul/25/uk-solar-power-pioneer-solarcentury-profit-grows-860-in-a-year","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-25T05:01:37Z","webTitle":"UK solar power pioneer Solarcentury profit grows 860% in a year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/25/uk-solar-power-pioneer-solarcentury-profit-grows-860-in-a-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2019/jul/25/uk-solar-power-pioneer-solarcentury-profit-grows-860-in-a-year","fields":{"headline":"UK solar power pioneer Solarcentury profit grows 860% in a year","bodyText":"A UK solar power pioneer has grown its profits eight-fold by investing in subsidy-free solar farms, a portion of which will help connect homes in Africa to small-scale solar-powered lighting systems. Solarcentury, one of the UK’s fastest growing renewable energy companies, will report profits of £14.4m for the year ending in March, compared with £1.5m the year before. A 5% share of the record profits will be channelled into SolarAid, a charity that has helped connect 2m homes in Africa to reliable electricity since it was founded by Solarcentury in 2006. The rapidly rising profits follow a four-year growth strategy in which the company has invested heavily in building and running subsidy-free solar projects in southern Europe, Latin America and Africa. In the year ahead the UK will emerge as a key focus for subsidy-free projects, owing to falling technology costs that have made solar power more economical in more overcast countries. The better than expected results are likely to stoke investor interest in the company, which was put up for sale this year and could fetch £250m for its current owners. But the sale could spell the end of the donations to SolarAid as the new owners will not be held to the same agreement. Solarcentury hands a share of its net profit to the charity every year to fund a not-for-profit home-solar company that sells mini solar panels to homes in Uganda, Malawi and Zambia on a pay-as-you-go basis. The company’s record profits mean SolarAid will receive more than £500,000 from Solarcentury, which could fund 125,000 new home-solar installations. Each system includes a mini solar panel, battery and an ultra-efficient electric lamp. One solar-powered light saves a typical family about £56 a year on kerosene for lamps and stoves, which contribute to air pollution and home accidents, according to SolarAid. It estimates that its solar systems have generated enough night-time light for an extra 6bn hours of homework or studying."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/sep/13/california-wildfires-biden-trip-climate-crisis-links-extreme-weather","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-14T01:50:36Z","webTitle":"‘It’s a reality’: Biden calls for urgency in California as climate crisis fuels wildfires","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/13/california-wildfires-biden-trip-climate-crisis-links-extreme-weather","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/sep/13/california-wildfires-biden-trip-climate-crisis-links-extreme-weather","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s a reality’: Biden calls for urgency in California as climate crisis fuels wildfires","bodyText":"Joe Biden travelled to California on Monday to survey wildfire damage as the state battles a devastating fire season that is on track to outpace that of 2020, the state’s worst on record. The president is using the trip to highlight the connection between the climate crisis and the west’s increasingly extreme wildfires as he seeks to rally support for a $3.5tn spending plan Congress is debating. Biden pointed to wildfires burning through the west to argue for his plan, calling year-round fires and other extreme weather a climate crisis reality the nation can no longer ignore. The president’s visit to California is part of a two-day tour of the west including stops at the National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho and Denver, Colorado. While in California, the president also campaigned with the state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who faces a recall election on Tuesday. Speaking alongside Newsom ahead of a tour of wildfire-damaged areas in northern California, Biden said the huge blazes that had rocked the state this summer “are being supercharged by climate change”. “It isn’t about red or blue states. It’s about fires,” the president said. “Scientists have been warning us for years that extreme weather is going to get more extreme. We’re living it in real time.” Newsom, who spoke before Biden, warned that California was “dealing with extremes the likes of which we’ve never dealt with in our state’s history”. During his earlier visit to Boise, Idaho, Biden echoed the comments he made last week while surveying the damage caused by Hurricane Ida, stressing that the perils of the climate crisis are a bipartisan issue. “It’s not a Democrat thing, it’s not a Republican thing. It’s a weather thing,” the president said. “It’s a reality. It’s serious. And we can do this. We can do this. And in the process of building back, we can create jobs.” The president argued for spending now to make the future effects of the crisis less costly, as he did during recent stops in Louisiana, New York and New Jersey, all states that suffered millions of dollars in flood and other damage and scores of deaths after Hurricane Ida. Aiming to boost support for his rebuilding plans, the president said every dollar spent on “resilience” would save $6 in future costs. He said efforts must go beyond simply restoring damaged systems and ensure communities can withstand catastrophic weather. Just before his visit on Monday, Biden issued a disaster declaration for California in response to the Caldor fire, which has destroyed 782 homes, scorched 342 sq miles and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands in the Lake Tahoe Basin. In August, Biden approved another disaster declaration to provide aid after the River fire and the Dixie fire, the largest single fire in California history. Wildfires in California this year have leveled entire towns, killed one person and burned 2m acres. California and several other western states experienced their hottest summers on record this year as the climate crisis fueled deadly heatwaves. Experts have said that without dramatic action to combat the climate emergency and reintroduce fire into the landscape, California and the American west will continue to endure devastating fire seasons. “All evidence would suggest a business as usual scenario where we keep warming the climate and we don’t rapidly scale up our efforts to get fuels out of the forest, we’re going to see a lot more wildfire and a lot more extreme wildfire. The science is clear on that,” Marshall Burke, an associate professor in the department of earth system science at Stanford, told the Guardian last month. The Biden administration in June laid out a plan to step up its investments to combat the west’s wildfire crisis, after facing criticism the federal efforts are underresourced and understaffed. The plan includes hiring more federal firefighters and using new technologies to detect and address fires quickly. The spending plan, which faces skepticism from centrist Democrats, includes climate provisions such as tax incentives for clean energy and electric vehicles, investments to transition the economy away from fossil fuels and toward renewable sources such as wind and solar power, and creation of a civilian climate corps. Biden recently declared a “code red” moment for the nation to act on the climate crisis while visiting a New York City neighborhood damaged by Hurricane Ida. “Folks, the evidence is clear: climate change poses an existential threat to our lives, to our economy,” he said during the New York visit. “And the threat is here; it’s not going to get any better. The question: can it get worse? We can stop it from getting worse.” Joan E Greve contributed reporting"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2021/aug/20/billie-eilish-lorde-lizzo-women-music-industry-fame","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-20T15:20:09Z","webTitle":"Billie, Lorde, Lizzo: has being a female pop star in 2021 become unbearable?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/20/billie-eilish-lorde-lizzo-women-music-industry-fame","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2021/aug/20/billie-eilish-lorde-lizzo-women-music-industry-fame","fields":{"headline":"Billie, Lorde, Lizzo: has being a female pop star in 2021 become unbearable?","bodyText":"The mechanisms of pop stardom have never been subject to as much scrutiny as they are now. Britney Spears’ conservatorship struggle exposed their potential for (alleged) abuse. Raye recently split from her major label, Polydor, after she reached breaking point and shared her frustrations about not being allowed to release her debut album despite signing in 2014 and helming numerous massive hit singles. Former X Factor winner Rebecca Ferguson has called for a parliamentary inquiry into alleged widespread music industry wrongdoing. That labels should root out exploitative and predatory behaviour and protect exposed young stars is a baseline requirement. But increasingly it seems that the existential state of pop stardom – particularly for young women, subject to greater scrutiny than their male peers and often held to contradictory standards – is intolerable beyond any level of protection. Lorde’s third album, Solar Power, released today, lingers on the damage that fame wreaked on the New Zealand star, who broke out at 16 and is still only 24. The lyrics describe her as a “teen millionaire having nightmares from the camera flash” and enduring panic attacks before performances of her “fistful of tunes that it’s painful to play”. She explains that she fled fame, with its “poison arrows aimed directly at my head”, as well as the expectation to be a generational voice, to retreat to her New Zealand home town for a more grounded kind of life. The song California distils this shift: it starts with Lorde remembering the moment when “Carole called my name” – that is, Carole King, who presented her with the Grammy for song of the year, for Royals, in 2014. It also works as a hat-tip to a woman who famously put domesticity before stardom; a spoken-word cameo from Robyn on Secrets from a Girl (Who’s Seen It All) establishes kinship with another teenage pop star who went her own way. There will be cheap gags in unimpressed reviews of Solar Power suggesting this low-key, drifty record will torpedo Lorde’s career for her, and sneers that these are hardly relatable complaints. But she isn’t alone in highlighting the impossibility of staying sane within pop’s infrastructure today. “Things I once enjoyed just keep me employed now,” Billie Eilish sings on Getting Older, the first song on her recently released second album, Happier Than Ever. Five years younger than Lorde, she has reached the same conclusions one album sooner, forgoing the fantastical horror behind the lyrics of her debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, to detail the depressingly humdrum bogeymen that now stalk her life: untrustworthy lovers, deranged obsessives, paparazzi and trolls waiting to pounce on the faintest hint of a wrong move. She can’t post a picture of herself goofing around with the female co-stars of a music video without being accused of queerbaiting, nor wear a tank top without becoming a lightning rod for debate about body image. None of it sounds fun, and not in the Drake “protesting too much” way. Creative autonomy and speaking directly to fans via social media mean that Eilish has never had to conceal her antipathy to fame and how it has ruined elements of her life, unlike earlier generations of female pop star who had to sell a whole, shiny, aspirational product. That she doesn’t make her status sound desirable is paradoxically part of her gigantic appeal to authenticity-craving gen Z. And so privacy has become a vanishingly rare commodity, one she flaunts in the lyrics to her new album as if it were a coveted jewel; her current aspirations, she makes clear, are happiness and respect. The music of Happier Than Ever is also much subtler and slinkier than on Eilish’s debut, for which her producer brother Finneas had to trick her into writing a hit (Bad Guy) at the behest of the label. It’s as if she is tempering expectations and reclaiming space to grow. Her commercial performance has shrunk in tandem: she had just the fifth largest opening week of any 2021 album in the US – a shock considering her stature – and the only first-week records she broke in the US and the UK were for vinyl sales, buoyed by the faithful. History isn’t exactly littered with musicians who escaped pop stardom unscathed. Pop has a body count and a dazed survivors’ group. As artists have claimed their own voices over the past decade, they have become more open about the toll of visibility and of maintaining an imperial streak as they face down fleeting creative inspiration, commercial pressures and the looming cliff of ageism. “Reinvent yourself, but only in a way that we find to be equally comforting but also a challenge for you,” as Taylor Swift summarised in her 2019 documentary Miss Americana. “Live out a narrative that we find to be interesting enough to entertain us, but not so crazy that it makes us uncomfortable.” Social media has made fame even less tolerable, rife with distorting praise and unfiltered hatred: both Eilish and Lorde quit Twitter in an early strike at self-protection – one that nonetheless is only available to stars who can maintain omnipresence without it. Another part of the problem is that Eilish and Lorde modelled a new type of teen pop stardom – songwriters first, extruded teen aesthetic beyond what any marketing exec could ever dream up – that nonetheless emerged into the old models of exposure and scrutiny. Both from evidently loving, artsy families, they arrived at fame via songs that blew up on SoundCloud and a media primed to fetishise anyone that chimes strongly with teenagers. (See, too, early YouTube phenom Clairo, whose recent second album, Sling, decried record industry execs staring down her top and how she warped herself to play the part of willing ingenue; it also paid musical homage to Carole King.) Lizzo had a comparable rise, spending years as an under-the-radar indie rapper before her empowerment singles Good As Hell and Truth Hurts blew up, several years after their initial release. They made her into a global star – but also opened her up to extreme and often conflicting attacks beyond anything that Eilish or Lorde might experience owing to being a visible, confident, Black, fat woman: subject to racism as well as arguments that she panders to a white gaze; fat-shamed but also criticised for sharing her experiences of a juice cleanse. She attempted to trounce her various haters with her comeback single Rumors – but swathes of the response were so vitriolic that she soon posted footage of herself in tears, unable to comprehend the hate. Facebook stepped in to remove accounts that broke the site’s rules around hate speech, harassment and bullying in their posts on her page. Her position seems unbearable – and there’s no obvious easy fix. It is Black pop stars such as Beyoncé and Frank Ocean who pioneered the art of self-preservation in the social-media age, disappearing and acting like cult icons despite their towering status to protect their vision. The likes of Lana Del Rey, Swift and Ariana Grande followed suit – but it’s difficult to see how Lizzo could adopt that tactic while still making music that extols pride and confidence, when to vanish would be to tacitly admit that self-assurance isn’t actually enough. Heightened awareness of the mental health of pop stars only became the norm shockingly recently. That in itself is now used as a marketing tool by which an artist’s personal trauma, and particularly any anguish sustained from their industry experiences, no longer derails their careers but is folded into the overall package, “proof” of their authenticity and distance from the era when pop stars were expected to be contrivances (and often derided for it). It doesn’t really feel like progress – more the music industry having it both ways. And, as the likes of Megan Thee Stallion have found, being open about your trauma can simply create more fodder for committedly cruel trolls. Eilish and Lorde’s latest releases chime with a moment of societal refusal, firmly stating what they need in order to protect their mental health and mirroring a turn away from hustle culture towards more intimate forms of self-protection and fulfilment. Making lower-key music in the face of rabid expectation feels like applying aloe vera to a burn, and accepting a sales hit a potential way to establish a sustainable path forward long term – Lorde has said she isn’t worried that her environmentally friendly “music box” release, a replacement for the CD, won’t count towards the Billboard charts. Perhaps we are on the brink of a watershed, definitively ending the 1.0 era of conquering pop behemoths (from Madonna to Katy Perry) that the New York Times tolled the bell for three years ago. But individual solutions can only go so far: labels will simply fill any roles vacated. Obsolescence is built into a system that works against survival. Returning to X Factor, it is telling that the producers have chosen to end the show now. Presumably it is slinking out the door while mired in allegations about the mistreatment and abuse of past contestants. And the format is outdated – fans now mint pop stars with likes and viral dances, not calling a premium-rate phone line once a week. But it’s also hard to imagine who would sign up to be a pop star in 2021 with everything we know now – and hard, too, to reckon with the ethics of pop fandom when that attention only inflames a merciless and exploitative existence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/nov/03/nsw-premier-orders-grants-review-as-its-revealed-20m-school-solar-program-went-mostly-to-coalition-seats","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-03T04:24:15Z","webTitle":"NSW premier orders grants review as it’s revealed $20m school solar program went mostly to Coalition seats ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/nsw-premier-orders-grants-review-as-its-revealed-20m-school-solar-program-went-mostly-to-coalition-seats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/nsw-premier-orders-grants-review-as-its-revealed-20m-school-solar-program-went-mostly-to-coalition-seats","fields":{"headline":"NSW premier orders grants review as it’s revealed $20m school solar program went mostly to Coalition seats ","bodyText":"The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has ordered a review of grants funding in the state but denied the move was an admission that two grants at the centre of an anti-corruption investigation were improperly awarded. On Wednesday, Perrottet announced he had ordered the department of premier and cabinet to conduct a review of grant procedures to “ensure the fairness and probity of current grant systems”. But the state opposition says it is concerned the review may not go far enough. Labor said it would adopt recommendations made by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) to improve transparency over grant funding, as well as introducing rules requiring ministers to explain when they diverged from department advice. Perrottet’s announcement followed evidence by his predecessor, Gladys Berejiklian, to the state’s anti-corruption watchdog that the government “threw money at seats to keep them” and grants were made to help win votes. This week, Icac concluded 11 days of public hearings into Berejiklian’s conduct, a probe which centred around two multi-million dollar grants in the seat held by her then-secret boyfriend, the Wagga Wagga MP Daryl Maguire. The investigation heard evidence that Maguire had consistently lobbied for the grants over several years, and that they were ultimately signed off by Berejiklian despite concerns from within the public sector. The former premier used her appearance before Icac to defend the grants, saying they had been awarded in part to shore up support for the Coalition government following the loss of the Orange by-election to the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party. Since her resignation, Perrottet has been critical of the practice of pork barrelling in government, saying he disagreed with the “concept”. On Wednesday, he said he had asked both the department and the productivity commissioner, Peter Achterstraat, to conduct a review of grant funding. “Taxpayers expect the distribution of funds will be fair, I share that expectation,” Perrottet said. “Every dollar from NSW taxpayers is important. I am committed to making sure grant programs are fair, robust and follow best practice when those dollars are put to work in the community.” But during a press conference, Perrottet denied the review was an admission proper process had not been followed in relation to the two Wagga Wagga grants, saying it was “important there is public confidence in relation to the expenditure of taxpayer funds”. Perrottet also said the report, due in April, may not lead to any concrete changes in grant funding processes. “These guidelines haven’t been looked at since 2010, I think it is incredibly important we look at it. Perhaps nothing will change, it’s really a matter for the government to look at a better way of doing things,” he said. The opposition seized on those comments, criticising Perrottet for refusing to commit to an overhaul of grant funding. On Wednesday, NSW Labor said in government it would require ministers to explain “in writing and provide reasons” if they went against a department recommendation on grant funding. The party would also introduce recommendations made by Icac last year as part of its submission to an inquiry into the integrity of grant funding. The inquiry, prompted by the government’s $252m Stronger Communities Fund, found money was overwhelmingly spent in Coalition-held seats and led to an admission from Berejiklian that it did amount to pork barrelling but was “not an illegal practice”. In its submission to the inquiry, Icac recommended changes to the government’s 2010 “good practice guide” to include obligations for ministers to “act ethically and in accordance with general probity principals such as transparency, accountability and fairness”. “The growing culture of pork-barrelling by this Liberal National government must be broken,” Labor leader Chris Minns said. Perrottet’s announcement came at the same time it was revealed more than 90% of schools selected as part of a $20m pilot to fund solar power systems were in Coalition-held seats. The Daily Telegraph reported 92% of the 25 schools selected as part of the pilot program came from Coalition seats, including two in the ultra-marginal seat of Penrith in western Sydney which is held by deputy Liberal party leader Stuart Ayres. Three of the schools were from Dubbo, which is held by the Nationals with a margin of just over 2%. Only two of the 25 schools were from non-government seats, including one held by the rival Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The NSW opposition leader Chris Minns accused the government of prioritising “their own interests ahead of what’s best for the people of this state”. “Many schools who are eligible and deserving of the schools renewables grant will be rightly asking why they have not been successful. Dominic Perrottet owes them an explanation,” he said. But the government has defended the grants. The education minister, Sarah Mitchell, said the schools chosen for the pilot program were selected by the department of education based on areas where the “electricity grid is constrained” – and that the program had been targeted at regional areas. Her office released correspondence which it said showed the schools chosen for the pilot had been recommended by the department. An email chain from June shows the minister’s office had requested the department provide it with the list of schools, and that almost all of the schools selected came from its initial recommendation. Two of the recommended schools were not selected because one was in recess and the other did not require the project. “They are located in areas where the electricity grid is constrained and, in order to deliver commitments made through the cooler classrooms program, require an electrical upgrade which would have involved a costly upgrade to electrical infrastructure,” a spokesperson for the minister said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/sep/02/uks-top-climate-scientist-warns-against-defeatist-net-zero-goals","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-02T18:28:52Z","webTitle":"UK’s top climate adviser says criticism of net zero goal is ‘defeatist’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/02/uks-top-climate-scientist-warns-against-defeatist-net-zero-goals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/sep/02/uks-top-climate-scientist-warns-against-defeatist-net-zero-goals","fields":{"headline":"UK’s top climate adviser says criticism of net zero goal is ‘defeatist’","bodyText":"The UK’s top climate adviser has pushed back strongly against “defeatist” criticism that the country’s net zero target is expensive, and urged the Treasury to pick up the currently “incremental” pace of decarbonisation. Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), urged the debate over net zero to be framed in a more positive light: “It can be done,” he said. “It is worth it … I hope we can move away from thinking about the cost and see it as a mission to modernise the economy.” Two years ago, the UK led the world in adopting a 2050 net zero target, which is essential if humanity is to have any chance of keeping global heating to the relatively safe level of 1.5C to 2C. Last December, the CCC outlined five ways to reach that goal, which the cabinet will soon have to decide on before the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in the autumn. In recent weeks, however, there has been a wave of criticism by rightwing commentators that the costs are too high, which has put the spotlight on which side of the debate the Treasury will back. Stark said it was essential for the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to endorse the government’s net zero plan because his spending review would shape its prospects. “There are some big decisions to be had in there,” he said of the cabinet talks. “We cannot keep inching forward on all this. The incremental pace we have seen in some policies over the past 12 months is not going to cut it. This is a big moment. That moment is coming ahead of Cop26. There will be a lot of focus on what that strategy contains.” He acknowledged that some of the recent criticism of the CCC had been “unpleasant” but welcomed the debate about how to move to net zero. “I hope there is a battle around the cabinet table because they have to own it.” But he argued for a change in the narrative to a more upbeat message reflecting the success so far in reducing the cost of wind and solar power prices, the phasing out of coal and the decoupling of economic growth from carbon emissions. “This is such a positive story … I would love to see the chancellor shouting this from rooftops,” he said. “Why is the framing of this often so defeatist? I think we should try to change the record on this. The scale is this transition is what is so exciting about it. We didn’t blink in the past when we made these national transitions, like from coal to town gas, and from town gas to North Sea gas. We made it a national priority and we were proud to see it through.” However, he said the government had some tough choices to make. Whichever pathway the cabinet chose, Stark said state intervention would be necessary to ensure costs and benefits were spread fairly across regions and corporate sectors. Policies would also be needed to encourage modest lifestyle changes, including less meat consumption and a switch to electric cars, he said. “This is a difficult moment for those who like less state intervention,” he said. “This is the contentious bit. For those of you on the right, this can sound a bit state-y, and a bit command-and-control-y.” But he said the market would play a vital role and the private sector needed clear policy signals to support investment decisions that would decarbonise and upgrade the nation’s transport, heating, energy and building stock. He estimated this would require an eighth more capital expenditure in the UK than is currently the case. From 2030 onwards, this would require about £50bn a year of extra spending, mostly by the private sector. Low interest rates and high efficiency benefits would take this to less than 1% of GDP. Stark said the economic and geopolitical benefits of taking a leadership position would outweigh the costs. He cited industry upgrades, health gains, increasing skill levels in the workforce, levelling up society and improving the natural world, along with greater energy independence and less reliance on fossil fuel from “potentially very nasty” import locations. He said the UK also had a responsibility as a major historical emitter and as a signatory of the Paris Agreement. Time was of the essence because fossil fuel purchases, such as cars or power stations, tended to have a life of 15 to 20 years, he said, adding that policies were needed now to encourage investment to shift over the coming decade and then be scaled up after 2030. Using the example of renewables and electric cars, he said: “It can be done. I think it is important to say that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/nov/14/where-voters-and-consumers-lead-on-the-climate-crisis-businesses-will-have-to-follow","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-14T09:30:29Z","webTitle":"Where voters and consumers lead on the climate crisis, businesses will have to follow | Will Hutton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/14/where-voters-and-consumers-lead-on-the-climate-crisis-businesses-will-have-to-follow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/14/where-voters-and-consumers-lead-on-the-climate-crisis-businesses-will-have-to-follow","fields":{"headline":"Where voters and consumers lead on the climate crisis, businesses will have to follow","bodyText":"Capitalism has divided opinion violently in Glasgow over the past fortnight. Prince Charles rewarded those global businesses delivering on their commitments to net-zero carbon emissions with his Terra Carta award, declaiming that only the private sector could and would deliver, while Mark Carney, co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, boasted of the $130tn (£97tn) of private investment funds – doubled in six months – committing to invest in companies signed up to net zero. But capitalism, growth, greenwashing and self-seeking lobbying were denounced by activists and NGOs as the root of the problem. Prince Charles and Carney were dismissed as little better than collaborators in our collective downfall. In truth, a complex but ultimately hopeful dance is being performed before our eyes. The growing conviction of voters and consumers, further intensified by environmental campaigners at Cop26, that the climate crisis is real is forcing change. Last week, rivalling in importance to what was unfolding at Cop26, came the news from New York that electric pick-up truck manufacture Rivian, hardly in production, had floated for more than $100bn, valuing it at more than Ford and General Motors. It’s the kind of mind-boggling welcome Wall Street gave to young companies making petrol-propelled cars a century ago. Money is flowing in epic volumes to those companies riding the new consumer tide: driving gas-guzzling pick-ups while forests burn and hurricanes rip through the country with unprecedented force wins disapproving nods even in the darkest recesses of conservative America. The same phenomenon is behind Tesla’s stunning $1tn valuation. Europeans – the British in particular – living in countries where the capitalism is more ossified don’t get to see first hand how rapid economic transformation can be once entrepreneurs recognise where the new markets are developing: they can do good and make billions. What we as individuals can do and how we think is too easily diminished by the despairing analysis that humanity is doomed by the refusal of governments and big companies to act. Yet, confronted by mounting green convictions, they are acting and with increasing urgency: 130 countries, including the US, China and Australia, are making commitments to net-zero carbon emissions. Sixty FTSE 100 companies have signed up to the UN’s “race to zero” campaign. Our changing views count. For proof, look at how societies have progressed. I remember when libertarians fulminated against requirements to wear seat belts. Councils now differentiate between recyclable and general household waste – unthinkable 40 years ago. The controversies over smoking in public places? Today, no one wants to inhale secondary tobacco smoke and smoking is seen as antisocial. It’s the same story with gay marriage. In all these areas, the cultural change preceded and laid the basis for progressive legislation cementing what we wanted into law and could not be resisted, however hard the right attempted obstruction. The environmental genie is out of the bottle. In Europe, greens are in government or coalition government in Austria, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Sweden and Scotland – and about to be in Germany. Politicians are in the market for votes; Boris Johnson, who is closely tuned to voters’ preferences even if many in his party are not, has been quick to mount a volte face over the climate crisis. The consequences of the final Cop26 outcome are not clear, but more important is that it has happened at all. The momentum to “keep 1.5 alive” is obvious and that is as vital as the detail. What matters is how national governments and international agencies find ways of directing a capitalism that knows, given what its markets want, that it has to move in this direction. Here, some models are better than others. Germany’s social market economy is built on a dense interaction between state and business and a whole skein of public/private institutions that ensure that its capitalism is responsive to societal and stakeholder wishes. The transformation of the old iron and steel Ruhr region into one of Europe’s greenest industrial structures could not be achieved without the German business bank, the KfW, or the way German companies embed social purpose in their corporate strategies. The negotiations in Berlin between potential coalition partners over the phasing out of coal and internal combustion engine production – key Green demands – are protracted because, once set, they will be met. In the US, the extent to which politicians can muster the will to shape where Wall Street obviously wants to go, or whether capitalism might find the capacity to do it on its own, is an open question. Biden’s ambitions to phase out coal have been thwarted for now by Democratic senator Joe Manchin from coal state West Virginia, but the US asset management industry might achieve what politicians cannot. Coal mining may be investment-starved out of business. The UK is the outlier, suffering from the most ossified capitalism and a chronically underdeveloped framework between business and public institutions. Not for nothing, even predating Brexit, has the UK stock market been the world’s poorest performer for the past 20 years. The concern about our lack of innovation to harness the opportunities now opening up even prompted Sir Patrick Vallance and Lord Browne, co-chairs of the Council of Technology and Science, to write to the prime minister in September urging an overhaul of the financial system so it backs more risk, even extraordinarily advocating the creation of a UK sovereign wealth fund. Amen to that. Capitalism, as even Marx conceded, will ceaselessly seek out the new, but it has to be shaped by democratic governments. Just as it built railways and steamships in the 19th century, so it will build cars, planes and ships propelled by ammonia, hydrogen and electricity in the 21st. It will build space-based solar power stations supplying electricity to Earth. Companies such as BP and Shell, if they want to exist at all, will have to get out of the fossil fuel business by 2050; responding to shareholder pressure is what both have committed to do. What is vital is not so much Cop26, but, rather, the process, movement and social change it represents. Humanity has to save itself. It will be messy and imperfect – but we’ll get there. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2021/dec/01/pulling-the-switch-how-to-find-a-new-clean-energy-provider-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-30T23:00:44Z","webTitle":"Pulling the switch: how to find a new clean energy provider in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/01/pulling-the-switch-how-to-find-a-new-clean-energy-provider-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2021/dec/01/pulling-the-switch-how-to-find-a-new-clean-energy-provider-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"Pulling the switch: how to find a new clean energy provider in Australia","bodyText":"Since multinational energy giant Royal Dutch Shell expanded into Australia’s residential electricity market by purchasing our greenest power company, Powershop Australia, many of Powershop’s 185,000 customers have apparently considered jumping ship. Kane Parlby, 22, is among them. “I feel kind of betrayed,” Parlby tells Guardian Australia. “Customers decided to pay more for Powershop, to ensure we get greener electricity. To then be bought by one of the biggest fossil fuel polluters on the planet is … munted.” Dr Nikola Casule, head of Greenpeace research and investigations, says the customer disappointment comes down to a “real disconnect” between Powershop’s image and “where customers’ money will now end up”. Powershop ranked first in the most recent Greenpeace Green Electricity Guide, published in 2018. “It is determined by various factors, including emissions intensity and support for progressive climate change policy,” Casule said. “That led to a lot of people, who wanted to go with renewable providers, choosing Powershop for their green credentials.” While many like Casule call Shell’s acquisition of Powershop a “greenwash shield”, others like Jesse Lawson, product manager for utilities at Canstar Blue, see this as Shell “moving into a more renewable space”. “It is these companies that we need to see taking action, because their action is what will drive change across the industry,” Lawson says. Customers like Parlby have a lot to weigh up. “I’m not going to a big energy company knowing they invest in fossil fuel projects,” Parlby says. “And it’s hard to find a clean provider that covers both gas and electricity. “As a young person I also need to consider my budget, but I don’t want to worry about compromising my morals. I want to keep making climate conscious decisions.” In the wake of Powershop’s acquisition, finding another clean power company that checks all the boxes may seem an overwhelming feat. Casule says there are “a few different things” Australians should consider if making the switch to a new clean energy provider. Understand the options Casule outlines the three types of electricity retailers we have to choose from. “You have Gentailers (a combination of generators and retailers), that include giants like AGL, Shell and Origin.” Casule says these energy giants are generally “bad with climate”. “Then you have many retailers who source from as close to 100% renewable sources. And you have companies in the middle, that are usually profit-driven retailers.” Looking into each option involves comparing your budget with your climate priorities, and learning whether a retailer’s parent company engages in fossil fuel extraction. “I would imagine Powershop would score worse on that criteria now,” Casule says. For homeowners, Lawson says “if you do want to put your money into renewable energy, investing in solar power is also an option”. It’s not easy to see the full picture Next, Casule reminds us that “unfortunately, the way our electricity system works is actually quite opaque”. Australia’s electricity system was previously nationalised. “The government built the powerplants, ran the powerplants, and sold electricity to consumers,” Casule says. Over the last 30 years, however, public electricity utilities have been sold to private owners at various rates across each state. This introduced an additional step that wasn’t there before. Now, generators sell electricity into a wholesale market, and retailers buy from that market to sell on to consumers, at a mark-up. “Anybody with an internet connection and a laptop can set up an energy retailer,” Casule says. “You don’t need big steam boilers. You just need a retail licence.” Compare rates and renewable promises Ultimately, price is “the biggest factor for lots of individuals,” Lawson says. “The amount you pay for power can make a large difference to someone’s everyday spending.” But those prices can creep up. Casule explains most energy companies “make money off inertia”. “They attract people with a deal. And after a year, rates go back to the normal expense. It is made intentionally difficult to switch once that happens. “And that’s part of why it is difficult to figure out what you’re getting, for how much you’re paying.” Casule says to “learn how much you would be paying per kilowatt hour of electricity with one retailer, and compare to rates across other retailers”. At the same time, he urges consumers “look as close to 100% renewable retailers as possible”. When wanting to confirm a retailer’s carbon offset is legitimate, Lawson points to schemes like Climate Active and Green Power. “These are government-mandated partnerships with businesses, mandating that they do the right thing in their carbon offset efforts.” Lawson suggests “looking out for those logos on a retailer’s site when researching and comparing”. Where to start With more than 80 retailers to choose from, and differing climate schemes per state, weighing up your options may get complicated. An updated Green Energy Guide will be published by Greenpeace early next year, which may make the process easier. You can sign up to be notified when the new guide is released. In the meantime, here are a few providers to kickstart your perusal of clean energy options, though not every provider will be available to every Australian. Diamond Energy own only renewable assets, with zero emissions intensity, and present a strong public position against fossil fuels investment. The Melbourne-based private retailer came in second in Greenpeace’s 2018 Green Electricity Guide with a five out of five stars. Amber Electric entered the market in 2017, promising to provide electricity that is both “cheaper and greener”. Offering customers direct access to wholesale electricity prices – which drop when more solar and wind power is produced – Amber state they aim to support renewables, and the shift away from fossil fuels. Enova is a smaller community owned retailer based in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales, with a goal to support communities self-powering with local renewable energy. With over 11,000 customers in rural and regional NSW and south-east Queensland, Enova invests half of its profits back into community-run energy projects and education. Though Momentum Energy doesn’t rank as high as Powershop on the 2018 Green Electricity Guide, they do offer the convenience of both electricity and gas in one place. The Tasmanian government-owned provider owns mostly renewable assets, with close to zero emissions intensity, and presents a strong public position against fossil fuel investment. This article was amended on 2 December 2021 to include updated customer numbers from Enova. It previously stated they had over 5000 customers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2021/dec/31/2021-a-year-of-climate-crisis-in-review","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-31T12:44:46Z","webTitle":"2021: a year of climate crisis in review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/31/2021-a-year-of-climate-crisis-in-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/dec/31/2021-a-year-of-climate-crisis-in-review","fields":{"headline":"2021: a year of climate crisis in review","bodyText":"January The year began with a counting up of the damage after the catastrophic extreme weather events of 2020, from fires to floods. Looking at the US alone, California more than doubled its previous annual wildfire record with more than 1.7m hectares (4.1m acres) burned and Nasa concluded that 2020 had been the joint hottest year on record. The US’s Noaa and the UK Met Office put it in close second to 2016. And 2021 – the year that would see the crucial UN climate summit held in Glasgow in November – was not showing signs of being much better. The continent of Africa had its warmest January on record, while torrential rains fell in Malaysia, leading to the evacuation of 50,000 people and the death of at least six. Meanwhile in Turkey there were fears that Istanbul would run out of water following the most severe drought in a decade. But there were small steps of progress on other fronts. Within hours of becoming president, Joe Biden announced that the US would be rejoining the Paris agreement. The Israeli company StoreDot announced that car batteries that could be fully charged in five minutes had been produced in a Chinese factory for the first time. In my view, we’ve already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis and we can’t wait any longer. We see it with our own eyes, we feel it, we know it in our bones, and it’s time to act. Joe Biden And in the UK a plan to reintroduce white-tailed eagles to the east of the country was, unusually, led by farmers, who said they wanted to “inspire people with nature and drive wider nature recovery”. February The internationally renowned scientist James Hansen waded into the UK’s row over plans for a new coalmine in Cumbria, saying it showed “contemptuous disregard for the future of young people”. A few days earlier, nine activists had announced that they were in a tunnel under London’s Euston station, dug secretly beneath a tent, in order to protest against the high-speed rail link the UK government was in the process of building. A historic wave of winter weather hit the eastern US and Texas, with nearly 10 million people without power at the storm’s peak, and millions without water after pipes burst; it was later assessed to have been the most costly winter storm event on record. In an amazing rewilding operation in Indonesia, 10 rescued orangutans were returned to the wild. Helicopters were used to ferry the critically endangered apes deep into the forest. And in Madagascar scientists found what is believed to be the smallest reptile on Earth. Brookesia nana, a nano-chameleon, has a body the size of a sunflower seed, just 13.5mm long. March New York was lit up by news that dolphins had come to play in the East River – validation of a long-term clean-up of the river which had cost the city $45m. Further north, in the Midway Atoll wildlife refuge in the North Pacific, the “oldest wild bird in history”, 70-year-old Wisdom the Laysan albatross, hatched another chick. Banded by biologist Chandler Robbins in 1956, Wisdom has outlived a number of partners (albatrosses normally mate for life). On the other side of the planet, Australia was being hit by horrendous floods, with thousands forced to flee rising waters in New South Wales, and the insurance industry facing millions of dollars in claims. The same region, meanwhile, was also battling a mouse plague, with horrifying footage showing the ground moving as the rodents took over. In the US, Deb Haaland was confirmed as the first ever indigenous cabinet secretary, as she took over the environment department. The huge surge in renewable energy around the world continued, with China announcing that it had built windfarms with a staggering total capacity of almost 100GW in 2020 – an increase of nearly 60% on 2019. But Climate Action 100, launching the first ever benchmark for tracking corporate progress on climate change, found that only a handful of the big polluters were taking serious action. April A landmark legal decision by the German supreme constitutional court found that the government’s climate protection measures were insufficient to protect future generations. The government promised it would take action on what one of the young activists who had brought the case called “a huge win for the climate movement”. In the UK meanwhile, the coroner who oversaw the sad case of a young girl, Ella Kissi-Debrah, who died after an asthma attack in 2013, published a report which called for the lowering of legally binding maximum levels of particulate air pollution in the UK. And in the US, a two-day summit on climate change was wound up with promises on all sides, including one from the US to cut its greenhouse gases by 50-52% by 2030. The country also pledged to double financial aid to help other countries with their targets. “Is it enough? No,” said John Kerry, Biden’s climate envoy, who had earlier struck a deal to cooperate with China on climate change. “But it’s the best we can do today and proves we can start to move.” The shifts came against the background of a troubling development however, as scientists concluded that the warm Atlantic current linked to severe and abrupt changes in the climate in the past was now at its weakest in at least 1,600 years. The current is known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc). Huge sandstorms in China turned the skies over Beijing yellow for several days, while Cyclone Seroja brought heavy rain and strong winds to Western Australia, with some locations seeing their highest ever daily rainfall. May A Dutch court ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 in an unprecedented ruling that will have huge implications for the energy industry and other polluting multinationals. The decision came just as the International Energy Agency published Net Zero by 2050, a landmark report which stated that exploitation and development of new oil and gas fields would have to stop this year, and no new coal-fired power stations could be built if the world wanted to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Meanwhile in Australia the federal court found that the environment minister, Sussan Ley, had a duty of care to protect young people from the climate crisis, in what lawyers said was “the first time in the world” such a duty of care had been recognised. In France, the minister for ecological transition delighted and appalled people in equal measure with the announcement that the new climate law would take meat off the menu once a week in schools. Turkey was hit by “sea snot” – a blanket of mucus-like stuff that was silting up the coasts, created as a result of warm temperatures and agricultural run-off that encouraged phytoplankton to grow. But in California, after a short and late rainy season, the governor was declaring an impending drought emergency in 41 of 58 counties. June One of the most extraordinary and powerful heatwaves ever experienced by North America hit the west coast in June and did not go away. Caused by what meteorologists called a “dome of high pressure”, the heatwave extended from California – worsening the drought even as the first wildfires of the season began – all the way up to Canada, where temperatures rose up to 121.28F (49.6C), shattering all previous records. “This is the beginning of a permanent emergency,” the governor of Washington state said. Other parts of the world also saw scorching temperatures. Both Europe and Asia had their second warmest Junes on record, while Africa and New Zealand had the warmest June ever recorded. But efforts to fight back continued too. Poland announced it would shut down Bełchatów, Europe’s most polluting power plant (although only in 2036). The City of London said it would be creating a heat network and digging boreholes for one of the UK’s largest low-carbon heating systems. Sri Lanka braced itself for disaster after the MV X-Press Pearl, a ship carrying toxic chemicals, caught fire off the coast and sank. Meanwhile China was fixating on a herd of elephants that had trekked 300 miles into the city of Kunming. July The average global surface temperature for July was the hottest since records began in 1880, with Death Valley in California registering 54.4C (130F). As the US heatwaves and droughts worsened, India, China and Europe were being hit by catastrophic floods. Torrential downpours on India’s west coast led to 115 deaths, while Henan province in China saw a year’s worth of rain – 604mm – in a single day. Horrifying videos showed the waters rising in subways, while hundreds of thousands were forced to evacuate. And in Germany rows broke out when it emerged that a flood early-warning system had failed to work, after torrents of rainwater tore through villages and towns, leaving more than a hundred people dead. Meanwhile the Australian government continued to fight attempts to have the Great Barrier Reef declared “in danger”, with local politicians saying they feared for the impact the declaration would have on jobs. In the UK, the water company Southern Water was fined a record £90m after a six-year investigation found evidence that it had deliberately poured untreated sewage into the sea in order to avoid the cost of upgrading infrastructure. And, to top off a gloomy month for the planet, new data showed that the melting of Greenland was surging, with the amount of ice vanishing in a single day enough to cover the whole of Florida in 5cm of water, according to researchers. August The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change delivered its starkest warning to the world yet, concluding that climate change was unequivocally caused by human activities, and warning that some of the impacts were now inevitable and “irreversible”. As the heat continued, wildfires broke out in the Mediterranean, where the Greek prime minister described them as the country’s “greatest ecological disaster in decades”, and across more than 9m hectares of forests in Siberia. Meanwhile floods and landslides hit Japan, where more than a million people were evacuated from their homes, and also Turkey, Colombia, and Tennessee in the US, where a record-breaking deluge swept through homes and roads. Rain fell on the highest point of the Greenland ice sheet for the first time on record. A Swedish company shipped the world’s first customer delivery of “green steel” – made without using coal – as solar power outstripped coal in Australia for the first time when, for a fleeting moment, more electricity was generated by solar power. In the UK, Extinction Rebellion swung back into action, blocking London Bridge and Oxford Circus, pouring red paint in entrances at the City of London and locking on outside the Science Museum over its sponsorship deal with the oil giant Shell. September “Blah blah blah” was what Greta Thunberg called the promises from global leaders around the world to tackle climate change, pointing out that carbon emissions were still on track to rise 16% by 2030. As Cop26 drew nearer, and following the summer of record-breaking fires, heatwaves and floods, politicians everywhere were under increasing pressure to improve their offers. A US/EU deal to reduce methane emissions felt like a good contribution. A new protest movement launched in the UK, as Insulate Britain demonstrators began sitting on motorways to demand climate action in the form of insulation for the country’s housing stock. In Scotland, as preparations sped up, one man built an ark on a hillside, telling the planning committee when it asked if it was a permanent structure: “It’s not permanent in the same way that humanity won’t be if we don’t take action on the climate.” In a painful irony, new data revealed that the wildfires were themselves releasing record-breaking amounts of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, an energy crisis was breaking across the world, with sky-high gas prices in Europe and pressure on electricity and coal supplies in China. October China hosted the Kunming conference on biodiversity and announced a $233m (£170m) fund to protect biodiversity in developing countries. We shall take the development of an ecological civilisation as our guide to coordinate the relationship between man and nature. Xi Jinping With just days to go before Cop26, Australia, one of the countries most notorious for holding out against climate action, published its plan for how it would reduce carbon emissions, but it was called “a scam” containing no detail and no modelling. Elsewhere, however, signs of change were palpable, with a series of plans announced at the Middle East Green Initiative Summit, organised by Saudi Arabia. Their neighbours, the United Arab Emirates, will be hosting Cop28 in two years’ time. A Tesla became the first ever battery-powered car to top Europe’s sales chart. And in the UK, the government was forced by a near rebellion to U-turn and place a duty on water companies to reduce sewage discharges. In the US, one senator gained global notoriety: Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat, was holding out against his own party for huge cuts to President Biden’s climate change plans. For a brief moment, it looked as if Biden would have to go to Cop26 with no legislative progress at home. November Cop26 was under way at last, after two years of pandemic, delays, worries, criticisms and negotiations. World leaders gathered for the first two days and were exhorted by David Attenborough to be “motivated by hope rather than fear”. Biden had finally got his infrastructure bill passed, but the UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, put a dampener on events by making his speech and then hopping into a private jet to make the short journey to London. The first week saw an onslaught of deals on methane, deforestation, coal, the ambition to stick to 1.5C of warming and finance, with hundreds of the world’s biggest banks and pension funds with assets worth $130tn committing themselves to limiting greenhouse gas emissions. By the end of the second week of hard negotiation, the summit’s president, Alok Sharma, had cajoled countries into a deal including a ratchet mechanism that asked every country to upgrade its emission reduction plans in time for the next Cop in Egypt in a year’s time, and each year thereafter. However, many were dismayed that the deal did not include the loss and damage facility that most of the world had asked for, to help developing countries in particular pay for the impacts of the climate crisis already being felt. Beyond the summit, rain storms hit British Columbia in Canada, earlier battered by the summer’s heatwaves, broke up roads and led to a state of emergency. Out in the oceans one of the rarest animals in the world was glimpsed: the mythical white sperm whale, seen surfacing for a moment, from the waters off Jamaica. December The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced in the middle of the month that it had recognised a new Arctic temperature record: the summer of 2020 had seen the Russian town of Verkhoyansk hit with an all-time high of 38°C (100.4°F). Floods swept Queensland, Australia, with up to 180mm of rain falling in 24 hours in some parts of the state. The UK was hit by Storm Arwen and Storm Barra. Heavy rains fell in Iraq, leading to serious flooding and displacement. And tornadoes ripped through North America, with at least 70 deaths in Kentucky in what was described as the “most devastating tornado event” in the state’s history, only to be followed, by the end of the month, by record-breaking temperatures and snowfall. EO Wilson, who died on 26 December, had warned many times that humans could not continue to use the land and resources of the planet in the way they did. The biologist was caught up in controversies at times during his career. Nevertheless, his warning that “we live in a delusional state” if we do not understand the burden that the western way of life imposes on Earth, rings true even now. If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed 10,000 years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos. EO Wilson, biologist • This article was amended on 6 January 2022.

The researchers say the device is not only a source of green energy but also offers an alternative to current technologies for purifying water. These, they add, often consume large amounts of electricity and require infrastructure beyond the reach of many communities that lack basic access to safe drinking water – a situation thought to affect more than 780 million people worldwide. “These people spend a collective 200m hours a day fetching water from distant sources,” said Prof Peng Wang, a co-author of the research from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. With solar farms often located in arid regions, the device could provide clean water where it is needed most. What is more, the team say it could be used in a backyard or on an industrial scale. “Having a significant amount of freshwater produced continuously on a daily basis [means] many challenging tasks can then be easily achievable,” said Wang. “The generated clean water can be used [for] cleaning solar panels to remove dust particles; it can be use to irrigate plants and crops, making desert agriculture possible.” Writing in the journal Nature Communications, Wang and colleagues reveal how they constructed the device. On the top is a horizontal commercial silicon solar cell and beneath this are several tiers through which saline, brackish or contaminated surface water is run. Waste heat from the solar cell warms the saline water passing immediately beneath it – the water evaporates, passes through a membrane and condenses to yield clean water, releasing heat in the process that warms the saline water in the tier below that – the process is then repeated for the next tier. The purified water flows out of the device and is collected. The team found the device can be used to purify saltwater as well as seawater contaminated with heavy metals, with the water collected containing levels of lead, copper, sodium, calcium and magnesium all below the levels deemed safe for drinking water by the World Health Organization. While the team outline various versions of the device, they reveal that under conditions on a par with a bright, cloudless day the energy efficiency of the solar cell was about 11% – a figure they say is on a par with what would be expected without the distillation section attached, and higher than previously reported by others working on such devices. The device was also able to produce clean water from seawater at a rate they say is higher than conventional solar stills. The device, while not the first to make use of solar distillation, has a particular advantage: by combining two types of device that typically each require a large land area, and mounting systems, the approach is relatively compact. Wang said the device turned the traditional link between water and electricity on its head: conventionally, electricity is produced by heating water to produce steam that is then used to turn turbines. While he said the team was still working on scaling up the device and reducing costs, they are optimistic. “It is our hope that we move quickly to push this technology towards its large-scale adoption,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/may/02/nearing-giant-leap-for-mankind-space-possibilities-are-transformational","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-02T06:45:25Z","webTitle":"Fifty years after Apollo, space is about to transform our life on Earth beyond recognition | Will Hutton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/02/nearing-giant-leap-for-mankind-space-possibilities-are-transformational","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/may/02/nearing-giant-leap-for-mankind-space-possibilities-are-transformational","fields":{"headline":"Fifty years after Apollo, space is about to transform our life on Earth beyond recognition","bodyText":"The Apollo 11 space mission captured our imaginations in 1969. And it was achingly evocative to hear the recordings of Michael Collins, who died last week, talk about how looking at Earth from space rammed home just how precious our planet is. Last week also marked three other milestones for space. A record $8.7bn has been raised by venture capitalists in the last year to support companies in commercial opportunities from space; France’s Eutelsat joined the UK as a shareholder in the satellite communications company OneWeb; and China launched the first part of its own space station to host three “taikonauts”. We are moving beyond the wonder of watching Collins’s colleagues, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, walk on the moon to something transformational. Space is at an inflection point, about to join electricity, the computer and the railway as a great general purpose technology that will transform economies and societies. To those who dare, whose capitalism and governments have the right alchemy of entrepreneurial zest and public purpose, and who possess the sheer chutzpah to see the possibilities, will fall great prizes. Britain could be among them. Worried about the impact of nearly 10 billion people in 2050 burning fossil fuels that would lift the Earth’s temperature insupportably? Relax. Space is on hand. By then, power-station spaceships in fixed orbit with vast solar mirrors will capture the sun’s rays 24/7, turn them into microwaves and beam them to solar panels on Earth. Sci-fi romanticism? It’s already in the realms of possibility – and is one of the aims of the Chinese space station, with China promising to deliver space electricity as soon as 2030. It also informs the thinking behind Elon Musk’s SpaceX. His reusable rockets can carry material into space to build such power stations at a fraction of current costs. Musk is the man behind Tesla. The global car industry dismissed his vision of battery-operated cars as fanciful. Now Tesla is the coolest car range around, whose stock market value is worth more than the rest of the car industry combined. Getting material into space cheaply – satellites, spaceship power stations and factories – is one of the technologies accelerating the opening up of the territory. I’d back his vision a second time round. Factories? The only way to manufacture flawless fibreoptic cable, print exact copies of body parts such as hearts and lungs, create ultra-light metal alloys from materials such as magnesium that can be used in our bodies, and – more fancifully – reproduce an exact simulacrum of meat is to do it where there is no gravity. Within a generation, there could be space factories manufacturing all of this and more. Back on Earth, we will be transported in satellite-guided autonomous vehicles powered by satellite-generated electricity, eating meat manufactured in space. GPS navigation systems are already satellite-enabled, and that is only the beginning. Space imagery is getting clearer and more precise; satellite imaging identified the vast concentration camps used by China for its forced “rectification” programmes for Uyghurs. It is also possible from space to see who is illegally fishing and mining; which factories are using child labour; what infrastructure is reaching the end of its life; identify what rock formations might contain vital precious metals; anticipate droughts and floods; spot movements of troops and military hardware. Companies are proclaiming their commitment to the UN’s sustainability goals, but don’t, and can’t, fully audit more than a fraction of their global supply chains. The answer is simple: do it from space. Communications are being transformed. Air-traffic control systems for monitoring the whereabouts and the guidance of planes and drones will become wholly reliant on satellites. Universal 5G will best be delivered by the inclusion of constellations of low Earth-orbit satellites – like those to be provided later this year by OneWeb, the space company controversially bought off the receivers last year by the British government, which holds a golden share in the company. This was Dominic Cummings’ finest hour – even if he tried to justify it as a new freedom conferred by Brexit. So how come France can buy a stake, too – to join Japan and, it’s anticipated, Saudi Arabia? But without Cummings’ passionate conviction about Britain needing to have a space communication presence, a reluctant Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy would have killed the initiative. Next month the government is to publish its space strategy. It needs to be informed by the same daring that drove the OneWeb purchase. Britain is not China or the US, and leaving the EU has narrowed the possibilities of playing in the big league. But, nonetheless, Britain has assets. Alongside OneWeb are companies specialising in niches – manufacturing nano-satellites and antennae, and monitoring air quality. Leicester and its university is one of Europe’s leading centres for space exploration and manufacture, alongside Harwell in Oxford, and there are plans to make Fawley, Aylesbury, the north-east and Glasgow space innovation sites. The Satellite Applications Catapult (declaration: I am a non-executive director) is doing all it can to promote space-driven commercial activity, researching possibilities and brokering alliances. It has, for example, formed a consortium aiming to promote space-generated solar power, and, with Oxford University, is creating a centre to use satellite-gathered data not only to inform a green finance initiative but to create the AI for Planet Earth Institute, a kind of incipient Jenner Institute – not for frontier vaccines, but to promote sustainability. The public-private framework that worked so well in making Britain an international centre for vaccine manufacture in just 18 months should be applied for space as well. Britain needs to identify two or three areas in which it aims to be global number one – space-based solar power, Earth observation to mitigate climate change, and nano-satellite manufacture. Then we need to deliver on these goals with muscle and energy. We can’t pass this moment up. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2021/may/13/solar-power-us-utility-companies-kansas","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-13T11:00:27Z","webTitle":"Solar pushback: how US power firms try to make people pay for going green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/13/solar-power-us-utility-companies-kansas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/may/13/solar-power-us-utility-companies-kansas","fields":{"headline":"Solar pushback: how US power firms try to make people pay for going green","bodyText":"Kevin Good is the president of a small solar power company in Kansas – a state that tends to be so sunny you’d think he’d have it made. “I got into solar at maybe the worst point to do so in the last 50 years,” said Good, who runs Good Energy Solutions in Lawrence, a town of about 100,000. Kansas has about as much solar potential as Florida but lags far behind the state, powering only about 12,000 homes – or less than 2% of what is covered in Florida, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. That could be related to an ongoing debate in the states that is pitting utilities companies against solar energy. The Kansas utility Evergy has vastly expanded wind power in the state, but it is advocating for policies that would make customers less likely to install rooftop solar panels. That’s because if customers generate their own power, they won’t need to buy as much from Evergy. The fight has played out in state after state, from Arizona to California to Massachusetts – as power companies are threatened by the transition. In 2018, Evergy got permission from state regulators to collect fees from rooftop solar users, but Kansas’s highest court recently ruled that illegal. So, Evergy went back to regulators and asked them to approve different charges – a grid access charge and a minimum monthly bill. The regulators, at the Kansas Corporation Commission, rejected both proposals. They have told the company to work with solar advocates on a more holistic compromise. Andrew French, the chair of the commission, said in February that his state isn’t the only one in a standoff surrounding solar, particularly about how to rework a policy called net metering – where customers are compensated for power they send back to the grid. “This is not an issue unique to Kansas,” French said. “Others have implemented net metering 2.0 and beyond. I hope we will look at new models to try to figure out the appropriate way to value these resources.” Rick Gillam, a program director with the national solar advocacy group Vote Solar, said that Evergy is like most utilities in opposing customers reducing their usage of utility-supplied electricity. “Its general animosity has created uncertainty for solar developers and customers alike,” he said. Utilities have for years battled against net metering. Now, they are also turning to other billing strategies to try to recoup the money they fear they will lose when their customers aren’t as reliant on them. States around the country are reconsidering how they compensate customers who have their own rooftop solar. A lawyer for the trade group for investor-owned utilities, Emily Fisher of the Edison Electric Institute, said at a regulatory conference earlier this year that utilities in 2020 installed 12 gigawatts of solar power and in 2021 are on track for even more. But the pandemic left many customers unable to pay their bills, shifting costs on to others, she said. “We have to be really mindful of costs as we continue to drive toward clean,” Fisher said. ** Power companies have worried about a future like they see in California, which is far ahead of other states on rooftop solar and is considering overhauling electricity rules to try to boost adoption further. Environmental advocates say that amid the green energy revolution that the Biden administration is touting and climate scientists are calling for, utilities are standing in the way. “It’s the wave of the future. Customer tastes are becoming green, they are becoming organic in what they eat and what they wear,” said Ahmad Faruqui, an industry expert with the consulting firm The Brattle Group. “Why should electricity be any different?” The debate in Kansas specifically is not about whether climate change is happening and renewable power is necessary – but about how to shift the landscape to accommodate green energy despite pushback from powerful corporations. Climate change deniers are increasingly out of place in the state, which has seen a significant economic boost from wind power. Kansas’s governor, Laura Kelly, is a Democrat, although the state legislature is controlled by Republicans. Kelly supports renewable power, especially wind. One relatively new state senator, Mike Thompson, has attempted to propose anti-wind power legislation that one Kansas non-profit group has deemed among the “most restrictive”, in the US. Thompson – a former meteorologist who has received campaign donations from both the fossil-fuel invested Koch brothers and a Pac for Evergy – denies the science that shows humans are heating the planet at an unsustainable rate. In a sign of the times, his fellow Republicans shot down his proposal, and it is unlikely to move forward. Thompson and Evergy represent two sides of the opposition that stands to curb renewable power growth around the country. Thompson’s complaints are ideological. He falsely argues the public “has been subjected to a constant barrage of falsified, exaggerated and alarming claims”, about climate change. He and other conservatives around the country have sought to cast renewables as unreliable and expensive. Evergy, on the other hand, says it’s committed to reducing its climate pollution and has massively grown its wind power, displacing some coal-fired energy. Evergy’s power mix is 39% coal, 27% wind, 26% fossil gas, 7% nuclear and 1% solar and other renewable power. Evergy’s senior vice-president, Chuck Caisley, said environmental advocates are unfairly painting the company as anti-renewables and that he just wants rooftop solar generators to help pay for the grid they use. Utility companies argue that when customers opt out, they will be forced to charge the remaining pool of users more. “From an issue of fundamental fairness, we just don’t believe that because you put a solar array on your house, [your neighbor should] have to pay more,” he said. “It was never our intention to try and hurt the solar industry.” But utilities remain monopolies, meaning their customers typically don’t have other options. They are typically regulated by elected or appointed state officials, who determine how big of a profit they can make from running plants and power lines. Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Kansas-based Climate + Energy Project, said those profit motivations have stalled progress for years. “We could have worked together to find common ground and could have been so far ahead on solar,” Barnett said. “There were so many opportunities along the way that were missed because Kansas utilities were slow to recognize we are in a period of transition with our electric system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jun/02/flower-power-how-one-company-is-beautifying-the-wind-turbine","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-02T11:54:37Z","webTitle":"Flower power: how one company is beautifying the wind turbine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/02/flower-power-how-one-company-is-beautifying-the-wind-turbine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jun/02/flower-power-how-one-company-is-beautifying-the-wind-turbine","fields":{"headline":"Flower power: how one company is beautifying the wind turbine","bodyText":"Tulips and flowers could help harness the power of the wind, after a green energy company came up with its own spin on wind power in an “eco-art” design. Flower Turbines, based in the US and the Netherlands, has installations across Rotterdam, Amsterdam, parts of Germany, Israel and Colombia. The company aims to democratise green energy for everyone and make small windfarms a leading player in the green energy industry. The turbines pose no danger to birds and other wildlife, particularly in urban settings, the company claims, and they create noise at a low frequency undetectable to humans. Opponents of windfarms often cite noise concerns along with aesthetic complaints. Dr Daniel Farb, the CEO of Flower Turbines, hopes to have solved this problem with an “eco-art” design. “Big turbines are very efficient, but for some people they’re an eyesore,” he said. “They definitely produce noise, flicker and some degree of environmental degradation. I was looking for a way to solve these problems, to make wind energy available for everybody. “I felt that there had to be a missing solution that would work for the combination of houses, large buildings, the environment – close to people. In other words, how could you make something that could be quiet but also efficient?” The company has also looked into expanding into e-mobility, creating wind- and solar-powered electric bicycle charging stations. Roy Osinga, the European director of Flower Turbines, said: “Our product – compared to big windmills – is silent, and good-looking, which makes it very successful for building in cities, because nobody wants to live next to a turbine which is up to 200 metres high making a lot of noise. “Solar power doesn’t perform that well at night, or during the winter. The turbines that we are delivering are a good match with solar energy, because wind and solar have natural opposite panel patterns when they produce energy. “We are not a competitor or an alternative for the big energy companies. We are a solution provider for companies and corporates that really want to pivot their business towards sustainability.” Quirky wind turbines have been at the forefront of wind power. Vortex Bladeless, a turbine that can harness energy from winds without the sweeping white blades synonymous with wind power, went viral on Reddit in March where the turbine was likened to a giant vibrating sex toy, or “skybrator”. Another company, Alpha 311, which began in a garden shed in Whitstable, Kent, has begun manufacturing a small vertical wind turbine that it claims can generate electricity without wind. Europe is working towards becoming climate-neutral by 2050, after member states and the UK parliament agreed on the necessary targets ahead of a virtual climate summit hosted by Joe Biden. In the UK, most of the offshore workforce, including in wind power, could be involved in delivering low-carbon energy by 2030."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jan/21/make-no-mistake-labor-and-the-coalition-have-starkly-different-climate-policies","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-21T03:27:36Z","webTitle":"Make no mistake – Labor and the Coalition have starkly different climate policies | Thom Woodroofe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/21/make-no-mistake-labor-and-the-coalition-have-starkly-different-climate-policies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/21/make-no-mistake-labor-and-the-coalition-have-starkly-different-climate-policies","fields":{"headline":"Make no mistake – Labor and the Coalition have starkly different climate policies","bodyText":"Shortly before the 1996 election, Paul Keating warned the country that “when the government changes, the country changes”. With both major parties entering this year with a commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, none of us should be fooled that this means there is barely a crack of daylight between them when it comes to tackling the climate crisis. That is because the climate policies of each of the two parties put us on track for a vastly different country as soon as the end of this decade. And while there is a tendency to only focus on international targets and timelines when it comes to the fight against climate change, the reality is that these fundamentally affect what kind of economy, society, and environment we want to live in. There are five clear areas where the divergence between the two major parties is most stark and will shape what life in Australia will look like by 2030. First, when it comes to the cost of electricity that will power our households and businesses. Australia might lead the world when it comes to individual rooftop solar power systems, but we lag behind when it comes to the penetration of renewables into our electricity grid. Only a quarter or so of our grid is currently fuelled by renewables, with close to two-thirds of our electricity still coming from coal. Tipping this balance isn’t just a quixotic ideal, it’s essential if we want lower electricity prices and enhanced productivity. It affects everyday life. If we get the balance right, the average electricity bill could be more than 25 % cheaper by the end of this decade. For most Australians, the choice should therefore be seen less as about renewables versus coal, and more about the cost of electricity. But tipping the balance also takes time. In the last 15 years, renewables have increased around 20 % — largely as a result of a mandatory renewable energy target. Thankfully, both sides of politics now believe we can increase the share of renewables by almost a further 50 % by the end of this decade if we start now. The difference is the government would do so by relying on the policies of the states and territories to get there, whereas Labor would seek to go further through rewiring the electricity grid, and installing community batteries plus local solar banks. Even more stark is the question of what kind of cars we will be driving by 2030. Electric vehicles currently account for just 2% of new car sales in Australia. By 2030, Labor wants this to be close to 90%. That would take Australia from effectively last place on the podium of comparable nations to somewhere near the top. By contrast, the government hopes electric vehicles will account for just under a third of new car sales by the end of this decade despite the fact some European countries have already reached more than double that. The difference is between becoming the developed world’s dumping ground of immovable combustible engine vehicles, or benefiting from what will by then likely be the cheaper electric alternatives. This brings us to the third point of divergence between the two parties. The path we choose at home will also play a part in determining how we are seen on the international stage. Whatever your view of the Cop26 outcome last November, one thing is clear: Australia emerged as a diminished global power that seemed hell bent on continuing to bury its head in the sand when it comes to climate change. We showed up with simply a pamphlet as opposed to policies. We allowed our national pavilion to be sponsored by the oil and gas industry. We blocked critical parts of the negotiating text. And then we trashed the outcome before the ink was even dry by flat out refusing to take another look at our lacklustre 2030 emissions reduction target over the next year. This did real damage to brand Australia. Reclaiming the mantle of international climate credibility requires us to not just show up, but to sign up to the climate fight. Actions speak louder than words when it comes to how the international community engages with this issue. And with climate change becoming a critical foreign policy and national security priority for governments, it also means we face the real risk of the imposition of carbon tariffs by the end of this decade if we do not. That would only mean a higher cost of living for most Australians. But by far the biggest and most important difference between the two parties’ climate policies goes to what kind of economy we want at the end of this decade. And what kind of jobs that follow – especially in our regions. The government’s insistence over the summer that somehow Cop26 did not ring the death knell for coal has been like watching the Black Knight in Monty Python insist he just has a flesh wound. To be clear: for the first time, almost the entire world was prepared to sign up to a commitment to phase out coal, including Australia’s own negotiating team. China and India may have only been willing to go so far as committing to a phase down, but both countries’ net zero plans will require them to wean themselves off coal in the next two decades. That includes Australian coal. The hard truth is that coal may be Australia’s second largest export but it clearly won’t last forever. The government’s own “modelling” admits coal will at least halve in price by the middle of the century. So we either begin the hard work to find a replacement for our trade balance sheet or we do not. That’s not about killing an industry overnight, it’s about not cutting off our nose to spite our face. If the government was serious about climate action and serious about protecting our coal workers, the regions and our national economy, they’d have a plan to begin to transition this workforce rather than continuing to provide its workers false hope. Thankfully, we are blessed with a perfect storm when it comes to the alternative: the best climate for renewable technologies to thrive, a thirsty Asian market for green energy exports such as hydrogen, and a workforce that will need a just transition away from coal precisely where many of these massive renewable energy powerhouse projects would need to be constructed. As the Business Council of Australia and the ACTU have said, up to 395,000 new clean energy export jobs could be created in the coming decades if we choose wisely. Instead, the government is clearly banking in the short term on the fact that for many Australians seeing a future without coal is hard. And it’s true: fossil fuels still have a deep place in the Australian economic psyche long after the mining boom. As the Climate of the Nation report demonstrates, most Australians think the coal industry accounts for close to 10% of the workforce when in fact it only makes up 0.4% with fewer than 10,000 workers nationwide. More Australians work at McDonald’s. While it is true that Australia’s contribution to global emissions cuts will not in and of itself bend the curve of individual climate impacts, if every country did what Australia was doing, the Great Barrier Reef would disappear. Either way, by 2030 these climate impacts will become more frequent and intense as a result of our collective inaction, and even worse if we squander the rest of this decade. While this is the hardest to measure, it is yet another cautionary tale for the path we choose to follow. With both sides of politics now committed to net zero emissions, voters will hopefully reward those that can actually spell out how we can get there and how we can transition our workers and our economy in the process and deliver a lower cost of living. Not those that want to have their cake and eat it too. And this might mean that if anyone is now wedged politically on climate, it is the government. Voters should choose carefully. What kind of Australia we want to live in, and what kind of Australia we want our children and grandchildren to inherit is firmly on the ballot.

He says, “I can’t do it any more.” He needs time to rest and heal. I don’t know what that means for my marriage or if I can run this farm alone. Will he want to sell the only stable home I have ever known – my heart’s rest, my lifelong dream and the oasis I bought as a single 40-year-old? My husband has worked away most weeks, roaming across New South Wales for our solar business, so we have been cramming seven days of farm work into two at the weekends. We are just one of thousands of small-scale farmers growing beef for the domestic market, artisanal alpaca yarn for crafters, honey for local shops and small goods made from our garlic, honey and chillies. Our main farm income is from the farm stay – reconnecting city folk with country, river, platypus and free-range happy herds. The drought crept up on us – ground getting harder, air dryer. Predicted rains in August 2019 never came and by then it was too late. Cattle lost condition overnight in September despite hand feeding and then they started falling like flies. There’s a special kind of stress when a beloved cow goes down and can’t get up. Propping them up on their knees so they can rest and digest, carrying feed and water, and hoping for a miracle. The river stopped flowing. Birds were silent, dust swirled. The water level in the pools dropped by inches each day as the sun burned bleakly in an unrelenting blue. My 11-year-old and I spent hours trying to dig a cow out of a bog and feed her distressed calf. I got used to turning downer cows by rolling them with sheer force of will. I washed a million maggots off that bogged cow when we finally got her free and up. She didn’t make it. So many of my friends, whom I have raised by hand with love and laughter, lay down and died. We had to sell what we could rather than watch them die too. For pennies. The herd we had spent 12 years growing organically, year on year from our foundation cow, Daisy, was decimated. Then came the fires, roaring towards us like a freight train. The air was filled with smoke for months. Some days you could barely see 50 metres in front of you. We were choking on our fears, tears, smoke and dust. Our once lush pastures were dry and bare; all of us haunted, hungry, lean, bewildered. The farm stay closed for lack of water, smoke and dust. Feed prices escalated while income dwindled. The sky was orange as if the end of the world was nigh. And finally our day of reckoning in the wrath of flame arrived. We were lucky – we had two days to prepare. Putting sprinklers on every building, water tank, using precious drops profligately to avert disaster. And then we left, as friends pitched in to remove our most precious possessions. We returned to find bush and paddocks on fire but infrastructure safe. Our fear of a crown fire reprieved by a wind change. Then our lactating, much-beloved bitch went missing when the puppies were three weeks old. My son’s dog, his all-consuming love. There was no room in our hearts for that grief. I still don’t think we have even started to process the loss of Goldie. The air was thick with the sweet stench of rotting flesh and pregnant with dust. It was so thick, you could taste it. When it drizzled on Christmas Day, it was the miracle we all needed. Yes, we had been beleaguered and embattled but we would soldier on. That’s when the first news of disquiet trickled out of Wuhan and the long discussions with my British parents about whether to cancel their longed-for last ever trip to Australia began (they are in their 80s). Pandemic stress is a different form of helplessness. With my husband travelling all the time, his fear of bringing home Covid was palpable. Finances became even leaner as my son and I locked down. And then came the floods. We’ve lived through major floods before of course. But no one has ever seen anything like this. In the final peak, the river rose by 3 metres in 45 minutes – searing into our memories as we scurried to save what we could. I scoured the internet for pipes and a 45-tonne excavator to complement our little 15-tonner. We rebuilt our access bridge after weeks of wading through creek, belongings held aloft, and kayaking across raging torrents with diesel and supplies. There’s a human cost to climate change. It has a worn face – lined from squinting into sunshine and runnelled with grief from weary eyes. And not from just the disasters, but also the creeping heat on the thermometer on the veranda. The wild storms, the tornados, the dry lightning strikes sparking fire or murdering solar power systems. Insurance premiums keep rising and damage from one disaster is still outstanding when the next hits, compounding grief upon grief, stress upon stress, fear upon fear. You would think that the climate crisis and the world’s call for action is some sort of joke when you see the bonhomie and game playing by the government. Clearly they have never evacuated their home in terror, watched everything they love wither, stooped to start again with broken hearts and aching backs. They are playing with our lives, with our future, with our children’s homes. Depression is treatable but the despair caused by their callous disregard for the real impact of their hubris can only be cured by a change of government, a change of heart. • Sophie Love is a first-generation farmer.

Last week, António Guterres was resolute in the wake of the damning report from the IPCC on the perilious climate crisis. It should, he said, sound “a death knell for coal and fossil fuels, before they destroy our planet”. He called for an end to “all new fossil fuel exploration and production”, and told countries to shift fossil fuel subsidies into renewable energy. One of the first tests of whether anyone is paying attention will be if somebody rips up the plans for what would be the world’s longest heated crude oil pipeline – the 1,443km (900-mile) east African crude oil pipeline (EACOP) that will run from oilfields in Uganda to the ocean ports of Tanzania. If it gets built, it’s is a sure sign that the world’s leaders are not listening. The Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide-USA (ELAW-USA) estimates that burning the 210,000 barrels of oil a day that will be transported by the pipeline will produce more than 34m metric tonnes of carbon annually. This is significantly greater than the current combined emissions of Uganda and Tanzania. So far, the Chinese national oil company, French oil giant Total, and the governments of Uganda and Tanzania are pressing ahead, apparently putting the money that can be made ahead of the interests of the climate. Even on purely economic terms, it’s a terrible bargain. In 2015, the Ugandan government estimated that climate crisis damages will collectively amount to 2-4% of the country’s gross domestic product between 2010 and 2050. This is about $3.2 to $5.9bn annually, losses that will exponentially rise if crude oil extraction, export and use is encouraged. The climate crisis is costing lives and livelihoods in Uganda now, with flash floods and landslides taking lives and destroying public infrastructure such as roads and farmlands. Currently, communities that lived near Lake Albert have been displaced due to increased water levels. Sealed oilwells near Lake Albert were also submerged last year. You can see the same kind of damage across the African continent: in 2019, for instance, cyclones Idai and Kenneth in southern Africa took the lives of more than 1,000 people. Millions more were left without food or basic services. Severe droughts in east Africa in 2011, 2017 and 2019 destroyed crops and livestock, leaving 15 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia with food and water shortages. Yet whenever oil discoveries are made in Africa, governments move in haste to extract it without thinking of how people and broader economies will be affected. Little is done to analyse and publicly share information on how much revenue will be generated from the exploitation of fossil fuels vis-a-vis the economic and social costs of biodiversity loss, climate impacts, physical and economic displacement, and risks to livelihoods. Other fears about the pipeline are well documented: physical and economic displacement; a delayed compensation process; threats to lives and livelihoods from oil spills; destruction of sites of spiritual value. More than 2,000 sq km of protected wildlife habitat faces significant disturbance. The governments and companies involved won’t even disclose key documents to the public to allow meaningful participation and informed consent. Not surprisingly, more than 1 million people have signed a global petition calling for the project to be axed. But those numbers have to grow. The climate crisis is, in some ways, a crisis of inertia. We hear reports like last week’s dramatic missive from the IPCC, and for a few hours, maybe a few days, we’re shocked. But the oil companies count on our attention fading – because they’re focused on one thing: drilling for more. In a world where the temperature is rising fast (and where solar power is now the cheapest source of energy), that makes no sense. The UN secretary general is right: either there’s a death knell for the fossil fuel industry or there’s a death knell for our civilisations, beginning, of course, with its poorest and most vulnerable people.

Maybe some great culture can help. Here are inspirational films to get you excited about changing the way you eat, stirring podcasts full of fabulous ideas and, for those of you who need a stark warning, a David Attenborough documentary. Podcasts To a Lesser Degree Is it feasible to suck carbon out of the air? How effective is giving up eating meat? Is lab-grown beef a solution? This eight-part series debates these topics and more, taking an informed, journalistic approach. Outrage and Optimism Hosted by two of the UN team who helped forge the Paris agreement, this is an accessible, upbeat wrestle with topics from decarbonising shipping to dealing with the grief of climate change. It has big-name guests, too: John Kerry on criminalising inaction on climate science, Ted Danson on his fight for our oceans and Greta Thunberg on, well, basically everything. So Hot Right Now An engaging podcast from environmental journalist Lucy Siegle and wildlife film-maker Tom Mustill, which seeks out ways to get better at communicating the climate crisis, with assistance from David Attenborough. Some episodes feature activists such as Hugo Tagholm, CEO of Surfers Against Sewage, who talks about how the organisation moved from waving inflatable turds around to becoming a slick campaigning body that has changed laws on pollution. Costing the Earth Celebrating individuals who are making a difference, this BBC series features a golf course greenskeeper who sows wildflowers across the course and an Indian schoolgirl who invented a solar-powered version of the country’s popular mobile ironing businesses. Other episodes tackle cat ownership and purchasing an air conditioner. Film Kiss the Ground This cinematically shot documentary is a hope-filled, 84-minute dismissal of decades of assumptions, introducing viewers to the radical US farmers who are demonstrating that the more intensively we farm, the less food we produce. Woody Harrelson’s narration has a lovely sparkle, and it’s hard not to be uplifted by the claim that it isn’t just better for the climate but also economically more sensible to adopt regenerative farming systems. Netflix This Changes Everything Naomi Klein’s take on the climate crisis – that it’s not humanity to blame but capitalism – is all about forcing a rethink. We hear about villagers in northern Greece repelling an ecologically ruinous mining project, while an Indian community’s resistance to a coal power plant sparks a national uprising. Amazon Prime Video 2040 It’s a simple idea: “What would the world look like in 2040, if we just embraced the best that already exists?” Film-maker Damon Gameau adopts the perspective of a concerned parent trying to see a positive future for his four-year-old daughter, and manages to create a film full of hope (and occasional daftness). It’s jam-packed with world-improving initiatives from solar-powered community micro-grids of electricity to agro-forestry. Amazon Prime Video Seaspiracy In the seven months since the release of this documentary by British film-maker Ali Tabrizi about the devastation caused by the fishing industry, it has caused no end of outrage and fact-querying. But it remains an important and terrifying look at how the fishing industry may be driving marine ecosystems to the point of collapse. Lauded by George Monbiot, it’s an emotive and at times difficult watch, which asks questions few others have had the courage to. Netflix Paris to Pittsburgh Anyone already disillusioned by Cop26 may find solace in this documentary. Filmed in the period after Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris climate accord, it charts a rise in US citizens’ efforts to make the changes their leaders fail to, from people turning front gardens into farmyards to authorities turning ponds into solar power generators. It also charts how Trump’s claim to “represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not Paris” was the spark. “I started tweeting back,” says the city’s former mayor. “Pittsburgh was going to stay IN the Paris agreement.” Disney+ TV Climate Change: The Facts David Attenborough presents an hour of statistics-packed testimony from scientists on the existential threat we face. It’s a concise, rousing explanation of the global situation, which also sees scientists ignite some of the pockets of methane that lie beneath arctic permafrost, explaining that these gases could end up in our skies. Attenborough also presents a list of steps you can take to help. BBC iPlayer Apocalypse Cow: How Meat Killed the Planet This insightful documentary on meat production, made by Guardian columnist George Monbiot, is full of eye-opening facts. We meet fishers who have seen the life choked from their rivers by poultry waste, hear how sheep grazing has deforested the Lake District, and learn that 51% of UK land is given over to meat production. Tonally, it’s a gentle, educational look at the topic, shying away from diatribes in favour of visiting projects with hope for the future – such as lab-grown meat, protein created by electricity and vegetables farmed without fertiliser. All 4 Greta Thunberg: A Year to Change the World Part eco-travelogue, part likable profile, this three-part BBC series follows Thunberg around the world for a year. There are trips to glaciers melting faster than feared, investigations of pilot carbon capture projects and attempts to engage with Polish miners who see environmentalism as a threat to their livelihoods. It’s packed with inspirational speeches and to-camera appeals to take action. BBC iPlayer Seat at the Table “Whole areas of the world where people now live will become uninhabitable,” says David Attenborough at the start of this programme about rising sea levels by YouTuber Jack Harries. “Where do they go?” Harries meets young climate activists and interviews people living in the nations most severely affected. The stories – from the Isles of Scilly activist who galvanised her local council to declare a climate emergency to the Maldives resident whose homeland may soon be reclaimed by the sea – will be presented at Cop26.

Renewable energy’s share of electricity generation also hit a record 26.5% across the five states forming the national energy market in the 12 months to the end of September. Analysis by Hugh Saddler, an energy consultant and Australian National University honorary associate professor, shows continued growth in renewable energy generation, with the trend set to continue as more wind and solar power comes online. Emissions from electricity generation, gas use and transport in the 12 months ending in July 2020 fell by almost 14 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents – a drop of 4.6% on the previous 12 months, the analysis shows. The data used in the analysis, produced for the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, includes electricity generation in the national market, as well as consumption of gas and petroleum fuels. Queensland, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania make up the national electricity market that supplies about 9 million customers. But while fewer plane flights meant a sharp fall in aviation fuel use, a larger share of the overall fall in emissions was taken up by wind and solar power displacing coal in the national energy market. The pandemic had not delivered a clear change in the use of electricity, the analysis said, but renewables were taking an ever larger share. The record share for renewables also meant a record low share for fossil fuel generation. Electricity from burning black coal also reached a record low of 40.5% of generation across the national market. For the first time, Saddler says black coal’s contribution to electricity generation had dropped below 50% for four months in a row. Renewable energy’s share of the demand for electricity continues to break records. During the middle of the day on 10 October, renewable generation, including rooftop solar, reached a record-high maximum of 53.6% of total demand for electricity. August and September are generally good months for renewable energy, with days getting longer, the sun getting higher in the sky and windy spring days all happening when demand is also generally low. Saddler’s analysis predicts that renewables’ share of electricity generation will continue to break records in October and November. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, told Guardian Australia: “Renewables in Australia are now cheaper and more popular than fossil fuels, and we expect a lot more renewables coming on line soon.” He said the fact that renewables were helping to lower emissions more than the economic slowdown showed that renewables “can have far more of an impact than pandemics or technology roadmaps” to Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. “This is just the start,” he said. “But to really nail Australia’s emissions, you need to electrify everything with renewables.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/jul/17/green-transport-can-only-succeed-with-a-greener-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-07-17T15:00:03Z","webTitle":"Green transport can only succeed with a greener grid ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/17/green-transport-can-only-succeed-with-a-greener-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/jul/17/green-transport-can-only-succeed-with-a-greener-grid","fields":{"headline":"Green transport can only succeed with a greener grid ","bodyText":"The challenge of decarbonising the UK’s roads, railways and flight paths will rely on harnessing the UK’s cleaner energy system to power the future of the transport sector. Carbon emissions from the UK’s energy industry have tumbled in recent years, largely due to the shutdown of old coal power plants in favour of more renewable energy. But senior energy industry sources have warned that the UK’s ambitious targets to drive down carbon emissions from the transport sector will require an acceleration of green investment in the energy system too. “The energy industry has a huge role to play in facilitating the decarbonisation of transport,” said Graeme Cooper, the head of future markets at National Grid. He says a green transport system will require a multibillion-pound investment to rewire ageing power grids and fit vast amounts of electric-vehicle charging infrastructure. Additionally, it will spur a boom in demand for green energy to produce hydrogen for heavy trucks, ferries and long-haul coach travel. “There will be an uptick in demand for energy, so we need to ensure that we are future-proofing, putting the right wires in the right place for future demand. We also want to ensure that the energy we’re plugging in for the increased demand is as green as possible,” Cooper said. The energy regulator, Ofgem, recently gave the green light to a £300m investment spree to help triple the number of ultra-rapid electric car charging points across the country over the next two years. Energy networks are expected to install 1,800 ultra-rapid charge points at motorway service stations and a further 1,750 charge points in towns and cities. It’s a taste of what’s to come if the UK hopes to meet its green transport targets. The Energy Networks Association (ENA) estimates that by 2028 the industry will have needed to invest in enough grid connections for charging points to power 8.2 million electric vehicles. A green transport system will also require the equivalent of about 30 terawatt hours of hydrogen fuel per year by the middle of the century, which will require roughly a tenth of the UK’s current electricity use to manufacture, it says. Peter Kocen at the ENA said the speed of the transition would require a new approach to regulation – one that helped energy companies invest in anticipation of the boom in green transport. “The regulatory environment sets out investment over a five-year period and requires energy networks to provide evidence of immediate ‘need’ for this investment. But energy networks also need to be able to be responsive to the energy transition, including investing before there’s the immediate need,” Kocen said. Scottish Power is the only UK energy company that invests in the full energy “value chain” – from generating renewable electricity to running power transmission lines and electricity grids, and supplying homes. It believes the challenge ahead may be even greater. The company’s chief executive, Keith Anderson, told the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders this year that the company was preparing for more than 30 million electric vehicles to be on the road by 2040. “By 2050, we’ll need something like 25 million private chargers and 3 million public ones,” he told the trade group’s international motoring summit last month. “That will only be possible if the electricity distribution networks are suitably reinforced to cope with all the additional demand, and a system of fair access for remote or deprived communities is in place.” In addition, heavy transport “like bin lorries, big buses and boats, [which] are unsuited to battery power” will need green hydrogen – made using renewable electricity and water – to help heavy vehicles, he told the Observer. The company plans to invest £10bn over the next five years in projects ranging from “wind and solar power plants to battery storage – from smart grids to EV charge points and hydrogen electrolysers” to help meet the need for car charging and low-carbon transport. “In a couple of decades’ time, UK electricity demand will double, as transport, heating and industry all make the shift from carbon. In short, we need to electrify the hell out of everything over the next few years if we’re going to meet our net zero targets,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/may/11/first-thing-many-killed-in-gaza-as-tensions-rise-with-israel","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-11T10:53:02Z","webTitle":"Twenty-four killed in Gaza as tensions rise with Israel | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/11/first-thing-many-killed-in-gaza-as-tensions-rise-with-israel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/may/11/first-thing-many-killed-in-gaza-as-tensions-rise-with-israel","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: Twenty-four killed in Gaza as tensions rise with Israel","bodyText":"Good morning. Twenty-four people, including nine children, were killed in Gaza, the enclave’s health ministry has said, following all-night Israeli airstrikes that came after weeks of tension that dramatically escalated on Monday. Officials said seven of those killed in Gaza were members of a single family. The Israeli military accused Palestinian militants of launching more than 200 rockets and said it had killed 15 Hamas “operatives” and a battalion commander. Israeli medics said six Israeli civilians had been hurt by rocket fire. The escalation came after Israeli police stormed al-Aqsa mosque – the third holiest site in Islam – in Jerusalem, early on Monday with stun grenades and teargas, injuring more than 500 Palestinians. Why now? Anger has mounted in recent weeks over Israel’s half-century occupation and deepening hold over Palestinian life, writes the Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent, Oliver Holmes. Israeli police have responded to near-nightly protests with stun grenades and rubber-coated bullets. Hundreds of Palestinians and dozens of Israeli civilians and police have been wounded in h the worst violence since 2017. How has the US responded? Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said the rocket attacks from Gaza against Israel should stop “immediately” and that “all sides need to de-escalate”. Meanwhile the UN security council held closed consultations on the situation in Jerusalem and was considering a proposed statement calling on Israel to cease evictions and for “restraint”. The US has authorized the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds US regulators yesterday authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be used on children as young as 12 – expanding America’s inoculation programme, despite slowing vaccination rates. Previously the vaccine was available under emergency use authorization to people aged 16 and up, but now the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has expanded it to include children aged 12-15. Canada recently became the first to expand use of the Pfizer vaccine to 12-year-olds. Janet Woodcock, the acting FDA commissioner, hailed the move as “bringing us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic”. She added: “Parents and guardians can rest assured that the agency undertook a rigorous and thorough review of all available data, as we have with all of our Covid-19 vaccine emergency use authorizations.” How many children in America have contracted Covid-19? The FDA said that between March 2020 and April this year about 1.5 million cases have been reported in children aged 11 to 17. While children are much less likely to get seriously ill than adults, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) said at least 296 have died in the US and more than 15,000 admitted to hospital. Meanwhile, in India, where the coronavirus death toll continues to soar, a rare brain-invading black fungus is being increasingly seen in vulnerable patients, including those with Covid-19. Melissa Davey explains. The world’s renewable energy industry grew at its fastest pace in over two decades last year The global renewable energy industry grew at its fastest pace since 1999 last year – potentially setting a new standard for growth in the future. The International Energy Agency (IEA), the global energy watchdog, said delivery of renewable energy projects such as windfarms and solar power expanded by 45% in 2020 – despite the disruption of a global pandemic. Wind power capacity doubled and solar power grew by almost 50% more than its growth before the pandemic. What’s driving this clean energy boom? Heymi Bahar, the report’s lead author, put the “unprecedented” rise down to demand from business and governments, predicting the recent growth will become “the new normal for renewable energy”. California has declared a drought emergency across a huge part of the state Most California counties are under a drought emergency declaration amid “acute water supply shortages” in northern and central parts of America’s most populated state. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, expanded the declaration on Monday to include 41 of 58 counties, affecting 30% of the state’s population. According to the US drought monitor, most of California and the American west is in an extensive drought – raising fears of a wildfire season in the state like last year, when flames burned a record 6,562 sq miles. Why is this year especially bad? Exceptionally warm temperatures in April and early May resulted in fast melting of the Sierra Nevada snowpack, which provides about a third of the state’s water supply. The administration said much of the snow seeped into the ground instead of feeding rivers and reservoirs.

The scheme, which will be launched in January next year, works in a different way to its predecessor – and is likely be less lucrative. With solar photovoltaic (PV) panels – the most popular domestic option – costing between £5,000 to £8,000, and six months before the new scheme is up and running, should consumers buy now, wait or skip it? What is the scheme? All energy suppliers with at least 150,000 domestic customers (including the big six, such as EDF Energy and Npower, and smaller companies such as Ovo and Bulb) will be required to buy surplus solar, wind or other renewable energy generated by its customers under the smart export guarantee (SEG). The companies will be able to set their own price for this energy. In the past, they paid into a shared pot to buy the renewable energy domestic households sold or “exported” to the grid. The export price paid was fixed by the government. How did the old system differ? It was called the feed-in tariff (FiT) and there were two payments – a “generation tariff” and an “export tariff”. The scheme was launched in April 2010 and closed for new customers at the end of March this year. Those with existing contracts are not affected and continue to be paid. The “generation tariff” paid for all the electricity that households generated. Rates were set by the government and depended on when you signed up to the scheme and the size of your solar PV system. Rates were much higher in the early years – some paid more than 50p per kilowatt hour, but were cut over the years and fell to around 4p for new customers by March this year. Once you had secured a rate it was fixed for the life of your contract, typically 20 or 25 years. The “export tariff” paid homeowners for the surplus energy they exported to the grid. Rates were fixed by government for the entire contract term and were around the market rate for electricity. It was 3.82p/kWh until August 2012 and then 5.38p until the FiT scheme ended. For all households under the FiT this rate is paid on 50% of all the energy generated by the solar panels. The actual amount exported to the grid is not measured, so everyone gets this regardless of how much electricity they actually export. By way of example, if a property’s solar panels generate 2,000kWh of electricity in a year and the owner has a FiT contract paying a fixed rate of 20p/kWh (for the generation tariff), they will be paid £400 for all the energy generated. Under the export tariff the same household is then paid a fixed rate (5.38p/kWh) on half of the energy generated (1,000kWh) – £53. The household will also be using much of its own solar energy, a saving potentially worth hundreds of pounds a year. Is the SEG less generous? It would seem so. Homeowners will only be paid for the energy they export back to their energy supplier. A smart meter is required to show exactly how much. There is no longer a “generation tariff” so it is likely to take much longer (potentially 20 years) before the initial costs are covered by the SEG payments and energy savings. Unlike the FiT, the export price is not set by government and there will be no long-term contracts. Typically, consumers will be able to secure short-term fixed rates or opt for a variable rate which will pay the “market rate” for energy at the time it is exported. Should I still get solar panels? Energy companies do not have to start making payments under the SEG scheme until January 2020, but one company – Octopus Energy – has already launched two tariffs. The first pays a fixed rate of 5.5p/kWh and the other a variable rate. Solar panels installed now will be eligible for the scheme and consumers can sign up to suppliers as and when they offer tariffs, or wait until 2020. One benefit of installing now might be to avoid an increase in tax – from October this year VAT on solar panels and batteries will rise from 5% to 20%. Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?, expects solar installations will slow this year, but says that people invest in them for a number of reasons and often it won’t be about making the money back quickly, instead seeing the environmental impact as the most important thing. “Anyone hoping to make money under the smart export guarantee should think carefully. We don’t know what rates or contract terms will be offered and rates might vary widely between energy companies,” she says. Anthony Kyriakides, head of renewables at the Energy Saving Trust (EST), agrees there is significant uncertainty. “How will people search for different tariffs and compare offers?” he says. “It is understandable that many homeowners will hold off until things are clearer.” Can I store my solar energy? A great idea – but it costs a lot more. One downside of solar panels is that you can only use the energy generated immediately – that is, when you are at home putting lights on and running appliances. With a battery system you can store electricity to use later or sell back to your supplier – either way making savings. But battery systems cost at least £4,000, so it will mean even longer until you have paid off the initial outlay. ‘You need to stick with it’ Staying in a property for a long time is key to maximising the benefits of solar panels, according to a couple who have had them for the last four years. Ross Power, 38, and his wife Abi Gilchrist, 41, both professional musicians who run London and Kent Soul Choirs, installed PV panels at their home in Whitstable, Kent, in 2015. They got a fixed 12.8p/kWh rate under the generation tariff and earn about £600 annually. They also use the panels to heat a water tank and are paid the export tariff. Together with savings from using their own power, that adds up to around another £600 a year. Yet despite the loss of the FiT scheme for new customers, they maintain there are still savings to be made - but you need to stick with them. “It does appear there is less incentive to install panels,” says Ross. “But if you want to be greener, do it. We have seen huge savings in our energy bills regardless of the money earned through the feed-in tariff.” There are downsides: “The panels become less efficient over time, so earning potential will fall. You have got to keep the panels clean and this costs about £100 each year.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2020/oct/13/co2-emissions-covid-iea","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-10-13T04:00:00Z","webTitle":"Stop CO2 emissions bouncing back after Covid plunge, says IEA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/13/co2-emissions-covid-iea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/oct/13/co2-emissions-covid-iea","fields":{"headline":"Stop CO2 emissions bouncing back after Covid plunge, says IEA","bodyText":"The coronavirus pandemic is expected to cause a record 7% decline in global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2020, but governments are not doing enough to prevent a rapid rebound, according to an influential report. Carbon dioxide emissions from energy use are expected to fall to 33.4 gigatonnes in 2020, the lowest level since 2011 and the biggest year on year fall since 1900 when records began, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its annual world energy outlook. The pandemic has prompted a large drop in global economic activity, with energy demand expected to fall by 5% in 2020, the largest decline in the past century barring the world wars and the 1929 Great Depression, said the global energy watchdog. Carbon emissions are set to fall faster as zero-carbon renewable energy sources continue to grow, while the use of fossil fuel sources drops steeply. The pandemic has proved to be a catalyst for a move away from coal in particular towards solar power, said Fatih Birol, the IEA executive director. Coal, which tends to be among the most polluting fossil fuels, will soon account for only a fifth of global energy use, the lowest level since the Industrial Revolution. Oil demand growth is also expected to peter out in the next decade, but Birol warned against complacency that the pandemic would help to reduce oil demand or broader carbon emissions permanently. He said he did not see clear signs of a peak in oil demand or a rapid decline based on current policy positions. Under one scenario modelled by the IEA, based on governments’ current policies, carbon dioxide emissions will rebound in 2021, exceed 2019 levels in 2027 and rise to 36 gigatonnes by 2030. Under a much more optimistic “sustainable development” scenario, global emissions could peak in 2019 but Birol warned that would require a rapid change in global energy policy. “The world is far from doing enough to put [emissions] into a structural decline,” he said. “We expect that global emissions will bounce back with the rebound of the economy if no large shifts in government policies take place. “When I look at the scale of the challenge I believe governments have a historic task today to facilitate and in some cases directly invest in clean energy infrastructure.” Birol said the Covid crisis would “leave scars for many years to come”, particularly for the world’s poorest people, echoing warnings from the World Bank. Rising poverty levels may have made basic electricity services unaffordable for more than 110 million people, reversing several years of progress in access to electricity, the IEA said. Global annual investment in clean energy needs to increase from $300bn (£230bn) to $1.6tn by 2030 – equivalent to total energy investment in 2020 – if it is to have any hope of tackling the climate crisis, Birol said. The rapid rise of solar power and wind power, a key focus for the UK government, meant renewable energy sources will account for an increasing proportion of the world’s new energy needs. The IEA forecasted that solar power will increase by an average of 13% a year between 2020 and 2030. “Solar is the new king of global electricity markets,” Birol said, with growth across the world and cheap financing making solar power in some cases among the cheapest sources of electricity in history. Yet while the pandemic may have accelerated some improvements in the energy system, consumers in richer countries becoming more environmentally conscious is not enough, the IEA said. “The Londoners or Parisians or New Yorkers eating less pineapple from Costa Rica may have an impact, but the main impact is tens of millions of people in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Congo will buy their first refrigerators and air conditioners,” Birol said. He also highlighted an important blind spot in the global climate debate about the need to improve existing energy infrastructure, as well as introduce new technology. Using the energy infrastructure currently in existence as before would lock in global temperature rises of 1.65°C, missing the 1.5°C goal of the 2015 Paris agreement, the IEA found."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/nov/10/scott-morrison-could-restore-australias-climate-reputation-as-a-lifter-rather-than-a-leaner-with-five-steps","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-09T23:39:49Z","webTitle":"Scott Morrison could restore Australia’s climate reputation as a lifter rather than a leaner with five steps | Tristan Edis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/10/scott-morrison-could-restore-australias-climate-reputation-as-a-lifter-rather-than-a-leaner-with-five-steps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/10/scott-morrison-could-restore-australias-climate-reputation-as-a-lifter-rather-than-a-leaner-with-five-steps","fields":{"headline":"Scott Morrison could restore Australia’s climate reputation as a lifter rather than a leaner with five steps","bodyText":"Supporters of fossil fuels in Australia’s media and political classes have been gleefully echoing Greta Thunberg’s claims that the Glasgow climate summit has been a failure. Yet both European and American politicians have been busily working on other plans to discipline climate change bludgers. These involve measures such as taxing carbon intensive goods imported from countries without equivalent emission control policies, and also choking off finance to high-polluting industries. The Morrison government’s recently released long-term emissions reduction plan claims that it will protect us from such actions, stating the plan will “ensure Australian exporters are not targeted by trade action, and Australian businesses do not face cost of capital premiums”. While Scott Morrison might be able to fool voters, there is little chance the US and European governments will fail to notice this is a plan to freeload off their hard work. The government has been busily rearranging and rebadging funding to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Renewable Energy Agency like its announcement on Wednesday. But foreign climate policy observers know this is largely just a shuffling around of old money allocated to these institutions by the Gillard Labor government. Given what this Liberal-National government has claimed in the past, it would be political suicide for them to acknowledge we should implement a carbon price. Still there is a five-step plan open to Morrison where he could still claim their climate policy was all about technology not taxes, while also restoring Australia’s reputation as a lifter rather than a leaner. 1. Accept the court verdict that the environment minister has a duty of care to prevent harm to children It might stagger you to hear about a judge’s finding that Australia’s environment minister should seek to protect Australia’s children from harm. This case brought by eight children argued that the environment minister should consider the potential harm new projects, such as coalmines, could have on children by exacerbating climate change before granting an approval under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Instead of arguing the indefensible, the government could amend the act to require all major carbon-emitting facilities install best-available technology for containing carbon emissions within 10 years. 2. Require landlords to meet minimum standards for rental property thermal comfort and energy efficiency to be eligible for tax concessions The poor level of thermal comfort and energy efficiency of Australia’s rental housing stock is a national disgrace. Renters’ energy bills could be cut in half, while reducing emissions and improving people’s health by requiring landlords to ensure their rental homes meet basic standards of energy efficiency. This could be met through straightforward upgrades like better insulation; efficient heating and cooling via reverse cycle air conditioners; efficient water heaters; and solar power. Landlords receive large tax concessions which multiple economists have pointed out hinder economic growth while doing little to help renters. Why can’t we at least ask that in return landlords provide housing with reasonable levels of comfort for tenants with affordable energy costs? To completely remove any financial and political sting from such a reform, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation could provide finance at a concessional interest rate for such upgrades. 3. Amend the existing solar support scheme to drive uptake of batteries Australia leads the world in the uptake of solar systems at the household level. Around a quarter of dwellings nationally have a solar system. However, within the next few years we’ll reach the point where increasing amounts of solar generation will be spilled and wasted during midday hours because it exceeds overall power demand, and its market value will be very low. Yet once the sun goes down over the hours of 4pm until 8pm, more expensive gas-fired generators push the price up dramatically. To flatten prices in the evening and fully exploit the potential of solar, the government needs to amend the solar support scheme known as the Small Scale Renewable Energy Scheme to encourage the uptake of batteries. The level of government support provided to solar systems has been structured to decline over time and will be completely phased out after 2030. The rebate is now a quarter of what was provided per kilowatt 10 years ago and a third less than what it was five years ago. To drive significant uptake of batteries all the government needs to do is restore the solar rebate back to 2016 levels if the household also installs a battery. Meanwhile the rebate provided to those that install solar only will continue to decline, enhancing the incentive over time to couple batteries with a solar system. Green Energy Markets estimates that such a reform has the potential to drive the installation of as much as 10,000MW of home battery capacity by 2030 – equal in size to five Liddell coal-fired power stations. 4. Follow California’s lead on vehicle emission standards Morrison’s claim at the last federal election that Labor’s target to increase electric vehicle sales would steal the weekend is looking more and more ridiculous as each day passes. He has since tried to cover up for this embarrassing claim via a Future Fuels Strategy. Unfortunately, within hours of its release the Electric Vehicle Council labelled it a “fizzer” that left Australia as a “dumping ground for the world’s dirtiest vehicles”. Morrison could make an about face explained away by a change in policy in California. For many decades California has been allowed to impose its own emission standards on motor vehicles that go beyond those regulated on a national basis in the US. In addition, a further 14 states within the US choose to impose the Californian standard instead of the federal government’s standard. All up these states represent over a third of the US motor vehicle market. This is a market that by 2035 will only allow the sale of zero emission passenger cars. By announcing Australia will follow the Californian standard, Morrison can claim he is merely responding to changing circumstances that have made electric vehicles a vastly more practical and affordable option for Australians. At the same time he will ensure Australian consumers aren’t saddled with obsolete oil-fuelled cars which by around 2035 will become increasingly expensive and difficult to service and fuel. 5. Implement a green gas target Both the Morrison government and the oil and gas industry, among others, are claiming hydrogen will be a miracle cure to our emission problems. While it’s theoretically possible that it could provide weather-independent energy at large scale and affordable cost, a heck of a lot of improvement is required in order fulfil its potential. Feasibility studies and “pilot hubs” won’t deliver this improvement. If there’s anything we’ve learnt about effective climate policy in the past 20 years it’s that to get the cost of low carbon technologies down we need to deploy them in the field and steadily build up manufacturing scale. So if industry and government are genuinely serious about delivering affordable hydrogen at scale, they should be willing to back it with a legislated target that would steadily grow the amount of hydrogen we use. According to the gas industry, it is possible to blend hydrogen into the existing gas supply infrastructure at levels as high as 10% without significant modification to existing equipment. If this is accurate then this is what suppliers should be required to deliver by 2030. • Tristan Edis is the director of analysis and advisory at Green Energy Markets"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/05/cop27-crucial-climate-talks-more-fragile-than-ever-after-year-of-turmoil","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-05T12:00:09Z","webTitle":"Cop27: crucial climate talks more fragile than ever after year of turmoil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/05/cop27-crucial-climate-talks-more-fragile-than-ever-after-year-of-turmoil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/05/cop27-crucial-climate-talks-more-fragile-than-ever-after-year-of-turmoil","fields":{"headline":"Cop27: crucial climate talks more fragile than ever after year of turmoil","bodyText":"For oil and gas companies this has been the best year ever. The world’s five biggest alone have made a combined profit of $170bn so far in 2022, a figure likely to be just the tip of the iceberg – most producers are nationally owned, and not required to come clean on their profits. “We are getting more cash than we know what to do with,” as one senior executive from BP admitted, before the companies zipped up their communications in the face of public fury. Party time for fossil fuels is not what climate experts had been hoping for. If the world is to get to grips with the climate emergency, oil and gas must be urgently phased out. Instead, they are becoming one of the most attractive investments in the global market. “This is definitely not a good thing,” says Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, and one of the world’s foremost energy economists. “The companies are mainly paying the money back to their shareholders, which is helpful for the shareholders, but it’s not going to help with the world’s climate goals.” While the oil and gas execs have been splurging their bonuses, more than 20 million people in Pakistan have needed humanitarian aid, after heavier floods than any in recorded history devastated the country in August. In Africa, the worst drought in 40 years has left 146 million people facing extreme hunger. China has suffered the worst heatwave in history, Europe has seen record temperatures – more than 40C in the UK – and the US megadrought was judged the worst in 1,200 years. For António Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, the link between climate disaster and fossil fuel boom is explicit. “We seem trapped in a world where fossil fuel producers and financiers have humanity by the throat,” he told world leaders this summer. “Nothing could be more clear or present than the danger of fossil fuel expansion. Even in the short term, fossil fuels don’t make political or economic sense.” The bumper profits of the oil and gas companies underscore what a disastrous year this has been for the global climate. Vladimir Putin’s illegal and brutal invasion of Ukraine, as well as being a tragedy for Ukrainian people and a nuclear threat to global peace and democracy, sent already rising oil and gas prices into the stratosphere. It has also led to sharp rises in food prices, fuelling a cost of living crisis around the world. Economies already battered by the Covid-19 pandemic are tumbling into recession, and to keep the wheels turning governments have turned in panic to fossil fuels, expanding gas, oil and even coal production. “The sins of our current situation have come from Moscow,” Birol told the Guardian. “The Ukraine war has cost the lives of thousands of innocent people, and it has also hurt people in developing countries and around the world, in Europe and the US. People in developing countries have been worst affected.” It was all so different just a year ago. When the Cop26 summit ended last November, the world seemed to have turned a corner. Delegates from around the world celebrated in Glasgow, as countries agreed to limit global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – a major advance on the 2015 Paris agreement, which targeted a 2C limit while promising to “pursue efforts” to stay within the lower range. Science conducted since 2015 has shown us definitively that 1.5C is much safer, as beyond that threshold changes will take hold which will rapidly become catastrophic and irreversible. In agreeing a 1.5C target, “we got something historic over the line”, said Alok Sharma, the UK minister who was president of Cop26. Scientists have also warned that this decade is crucial: to stay within 1.5C, greenhouse gas emissions must be roughly halved by 2030. On this issue too, Cop26 made major progress. Under the Paris agreement, all countries must come up with short-term plans on emissions, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), most pegged to 2030, and update them every five years. But the Glasgow climate pact recognised that this update schedule – known as the ratchet – was too long, so asked countries to renew their NDCs this year. As well as these achievements, the commitments on greenhouse gases made by countries at Glasgow took us further than ever in reducing emissions in line with the 1.5C goal. Governments responsible for more than three-quarters of global emissions signed up to long-term targets to reach net zero by about mid-century, as well as their NDCs. If all those long and short-term pledges made at Cop26 were fulfilled, the International Energy Agency calculated, temperatures would rise by 1.8C. That is a big if, as many countries have promised long-term goals with few concrete measures to meet them, and it is still a breach of the 1.5C threshold. But it represents a major improvement on the Paris emissions pledges, which would have led to heating of more than 3.5C. “The political momentum changed a lot [at Glasgow],” said Birol. “It’s not enough, but it’s a very positive trend.” All of that progress is now in jeopardy. Governments are preparing to meet again, for the Cop27 UN climate summit that begins in Egypt on 6 November, but in a much-altered mood since their last outing. Geopolitical tensions have riven the consensus reached at Cop26, with governments at odds over the war in Ukraine and grappling with the cost of living crisis. At the halfway-point of UN negotiations in Bonn in June, some delegates staged a walkout in protest when Russia took the floor, and the Egyptian hosts are braced for similar scenes next week. Sameh Shoukry, the Egyptian foreign minister who will chair Cop27, told the Guardian: “We recognise the geopolitical conditions that have evolved over this year. But we are encouraging everyone to concentrate on the task at hand, climate change. No matter what happens to all the other challenges and tensions, we know for certain we will all suffer [from the climate crisis] in the end. We will all be impacted.” Shoukry’s strategy is to try to persuade countries to leave their other issues at the door. “We have to try to isolate these geopolitical tensions, disagreements, and focus on how do we move forward together. Because we can’t move forward independently – we won’t be successful.” To make things worse, the world’s two biggest emitters, China and the US, are now at loggerheads. Nancy Pelosi, the US House speaker and third-highest-ranking member of the ruling Democratic party, riled China this summer by visiting Taiwan, the island over which China claims sovereignty. Diplomatic relations between the two plunged to a new low, and even though climate negotiations are supposed to exist in a separate “bubble”, they have also been affected. John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate, told the Guardian: “China is 30% of all emissions. We need to get China.” One of the high points of Glasgow was a surprise bilateral pact between the US and China to cooperate on tackling the climate crisis. Shoukry has offered to mediate, but this year, it will be an achievement if Kerry and Xie Zhenhua, his Chinese counterpart, can meet in the same room. Egypt has called Cop27 the “Cop of implementation” – a recognition that the promises made at Glasgow have not yet been turned into reality. Governments made big pledges, but few have come up with the concrete policies and measures that will be needed to realise them. Sharma, the UK president of Cop26, warned on leaving Glasgow last year that the agreement reached there was “fragile” and that the 1.5C temperature goal was “on life support … its pulse is weak”. This year was meant to be devoted to shoring it up, strengthening commitments, fleshing out targets, but that has not happened. According to the promises made in Glasgow, all countries should have returned this year with improvements to their NDCs. Only 24 have done so, and most of these – Australia and India the exceptions – are little changed from last year. The UN last week estimated that, going by countries’ current short-term NDC targets alone, and leaving out the longer-term and more nebulous net zero goals, temperatures would rise by 2.5C. Sharma, who was thrown out of cabinet and demoted by the new UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, despite being widely praised around the world, told the Guardian more progress could be made in Egypt. “There have been many headwinds this year, the primary headwind being Putin’s illegal and brutal war in Ukraine,” he said. “But despite this, we have seen some progress. We’ve had revised NDCs come forward [and] if you add up the sum total, you’re talking about a 1.4Gt reduction in emissions by 2030. That’s an appreciable amount.” The UK itself, which might have been expected to play a leading role in trying to hold the Glasgow pact together, has shown questionable judgment. Under Boris Johnson, prime minister during Cop26, one of the responses to the Ukraine war was to hasten new licences for North Sea oil and gas exploration. After he was deposed in July, his successors ditched green policies even faster, first Liz Truss who embraced fracking while her business secretary vowed to “squeeze every last drop” of oil and gas from the North Sea. Then Sunak, who reimposed the fracking ban but – to widespread disgust among other countries – at first snubbed Cop27, saying he was too busy to attend, until stung into it by Johnson’s plans to turn up. Sunak and Truss were united on one issue: they forbade King Charles to go, even though the Egyptian hosts had hoped for him as a star turn. The king is respected around the world for drawing attention to the climate crisis, and made widely welcomed interventions at Paris and Cop26. He is also head of state for many Commonwealth countries on the frontline of the climate crisis. For the rest of the world, Sunak’s vacillation, the UK’s rekindled enthusiasm for fossil fuels, and the cooping up of the King make a poor showing by the country that was supposed to lead the negotiations this year, before handing the baton to Egypt on Sunday. All of this leaves the prospects for Cop27 looking dim. Shoukry told the Guardian the 1.5C goal was “more fragile” than it had ever been, and that forging consensus at Sharm el-Sheikh would be harder than it was in Paris or Glasgow. But there are reasons to be hopeful. Just as bumper oil profits have revealed the true costs of fossil fuel dependency, the Ukraine war has spelled out clearly the national security perils for democratic governments of putting their economies at the mercy of oil and gas-rich autocracies. The price of renewable energy has fallen sharply over the past decade, and now soaring fossil fuel prices have made it even cheaper by comparison. Europe has been spurred to a faster rollout of wind and solar power generation, as well as increases in energy efficiency. The International Energy Agency last month published an analysis showing renewable energy investment set to rise by 50% by the end of the decade, and predicting a global emissions peak in 2025. Sharma says this is good news. “The IEA analysis is that this year will see an increase of less than 1% in emissions, compared to last year, and that’s despite the fact that we’ve got more fossil fuels being burnt right now,” he said. “The reason for that is the big increase in renewables capacity around the world, and also the fact that we have a big growth in electric vehicles globally. If you look at the additions of power capacity around the world, about 90% of all the additional capacity was from renewables, and it’s expected to be the same over the next two years.” Gareth Redmond-King, international lead at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “Vladimir Putin has been a drag on international climate efforts for years, but ironically by cutting off gas supplies and sending prices spiralling, he’s caused the EU and others to run harder and faster towards net zero than is reflected in their current emissions pledges.” Businesses as well as governments are taking note. Andrew Forrest, the Australian mining magnate, is converting his business to renewable energy because “the sun doesn’t send me a bill at the end of the month”. Yet for developing countries, a clean energy future is a distant dream. In sub-Saharan Africa, Birol notes, “every second person lacks access to electricity”. Lacking it has huge impacts, forcing families to cook using wood or smoky paraffin, preventing children from doing homework, blocking access to modern medical care and disrupting commerce. For the leaders of some African countries, giving people access to energy and expanding their economies means exploiting their fossil fuel resources. Countries including Nigeria, Senegal, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo have known oil and gas resources and are hoping to share in the current bonanza. Mo Ibrahim, the Sudanese-British businessman, one of the richest people from Africa, who made billions from bringing mobile phones to Africans without landlines, says the answer is simple: let Africa use, and export, its gas reserves. “We need a balanced and a fair policy for everybody. Gas can be useful to our transition. [Developed countries who say otherwise] are hypocrites,” he told the Guardian. Ibrahim’s charitable foundation published a report in September that concluded that for Africans to treble their energy use from gas alone would add less than 1% to global carbon dioxide emissions. “It wouldn’t even move the needle,” he said. But African climate campaigners disagree. They fear African gas exploration would operate as a form of “neo-colonialism”, with the profits extracted by multinationals or siphoned off to domestic elites. Ordinary Africans would see little of the boom, but would be tied into high fossil fuel prices and infrastructure for decades, and bear the worst of the climate catastrophe. Lorraine Chiponda, of Don’t Gas Africa and the Africa Climate Movement of Movements, said: “The proliferation of gas on the African continent to remedy a short-term energy crisis in Europe is a reckless move that will further result in plunder of the African continent. [Instead we need to] regenerate and build restorative people’s economies that are not colonial, extractive, patriarchal and corporate driven. The deception of the masses by peddling false solutions such as considering gas as a transition fuel, or sanitising gas as clean energy, must stop.” The only way to solve this conundrum is through developed countries helping African nations, and other vulnerable people, to gain access to clean energy, and help them with the impacts of the climate crisis. That means stepping up on what are by far the biggest issues for poor countries at this Cop: climate finance, and the related question of loss and damage. Since 2009, developing countries have been promised that by 2020 they would be receiving at least $100bn a year to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. That target has been missed, and will be until next year. Furthermore, most of the climate finance that has been disbursed has gone to middle-income countries, and for projects that could already be profitable, such as wind and solar farms. The poorest countries, particularly in Africa, have lost out, and the little they have received has come mainly in the form of repayable loans that drive them further into debt. Poor countries have grown yet more desperate, facing food price hikes and drowning in debt. They feel Cop27, as an African Cop, is their chance. Whereas Cop26 focused on the 1.5C target, they now want to address the impacts of the climate crisis that are already happening, and the future impacts that are now inevitable. Adaptation accounts for only about a fifth of climate finance. At Glasgow, developed countries promised a doubling of adaptation finance, and poor countries will want to see serious progress on meeting this goal in Egypt. A senior UN official likened the current amounts to “putting a Band-Aid on a broken leg”. Much more is needed, the official said: “We need to throw the global financial kitchen sink at these challenges. We need to mobilise the finance now – that is what is needed in the developing world.” The failure by developed countries to come forward with assistance for adaptation has blighted the climate talks. Shoukry warned of a “lack of trust” between the developed and developing world – in this context, code for a lack of money. “African countries, as well as most developing nations, have expectations that the priority issues that they deem fundamental should be achieved, [to create] trust between developed and developing countries,” he said. “Cop27 is the venue where that trust can be enhanced and consolidated.” The extreme weather of the past year has shown that the changing climate will bring impacts that countries cannot adapt to. The floods in Pakistan left at least a tenth of the country under water, and afflicted about a third of the population. About two million people were left homeless, and the damage is conservatively estimated at about $40bn. The problems – economic and social – created by this disaster will take years to fix, and some communities may never recover. Catastrophes like this will only become more common in the coming years, and poor countries – with less developed infrastructure, and tending to occupy areas of the world more prone to climatic extremes – will bear the brunt, despite having done least to cause the climate crisis. For these reasons, their demands go further than finance for emissions reduction projects, or adaptation measures such as seawalls or early warning systems. They want help for loss and damage. Shauna Aminath, the environment minister for the Maldives, which has suffered severe damage from tropical storms, said they resulted in people displaced, homes and livelihoods ruined, agriculture destroyed, infrastructure swept away, and these problems carried on for years after the donors had departed in the immediate aftermath. When climate disaster strikes, it affects not just physical infrastructure but services such as health and education, and tears apart the social fabric of afflicted communities, in ways hard to repair. “These are the social issues that are left behind,” she said. “Any discussion of loss and damage must recognise these socioeconomic impacts.” Loss and damage is defined as the impacts of the climate crisis so great that they cannot be adapted to. In the early days of these discussions, a decade ago, loss and damage was framed as a demand for reparations or compensation from the rich to the poor. That framing was problematic, as rich countries could not sign legal agreements that could leave them open to unlimited future liabilities, and such language was explicitly rejected at Paris. Since then, the framing has changed in a way that both sides can more readily accept: loss and damage means helping countries on the frontline of climate catastrophe with rescue and rehabilitation that goes beyond the immediate impacts of extreme weather, and helps countries on a long-term basis to rebuild and protect their citizens. With so much at stake, the sums required for loss and damage are likely to dwarf the $100bn a year promised for climate finance. There is also obvious overlap with other aid spending, on services such as health and education that are generally separate from climate funds. Developing countries have put forward ideas, including a global carbon tax, taxes on frequent flyers, and windfall taxes on oil and gas producers. None of these is likely to be agreed by world leaders in their visit to Sharm el-Sheikh, however. Shoukry admits a full resolution is still distant: “The important thing is that we develop a roadmap on how deal with it subsequently, and provide a continuum within a specific timeframe that allows us to reach a conclusion.” Climate Cops, in their 30 years, have weathered geopolitical storms before, and the 45,000 participants expected this year will be prepared for a torrid two weeks of late nights, friction and frustration. Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who masterminded the Paris agreement, believes Cop27 can prove successful if countries seek honestly to address the glaring inequalities of the climate crisis that have become so apparent this year, and remember that this is an African Cop. “The unprecedented high prices of energy have provided historically high windfall profits for the fossil fuel industry, while turning abject poverty into unfathomable misery among the most vulnerable,” she said. “Cop27 is a moment to show solidarity with those worst affected by climate change, and be led by a courageous vision for a future of dignity and prosperity, for all African citizens.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/sep/03/barnaby-joyce-declares-he-wont-be-bullied-on-climate-science","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-03T07:26:43Z","webTitle":"Barnaby Joyce declares he won’t be ‘bullied’ on climate science","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/03/barnaby-joyce-declares-he-wont-be-bullied-on-climate-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/sep/03/barnaby-joyce-declares-he-wont-be-bullied-on-climate-science","fields":{"headline":"Barnaby Joyce declares he won’t be ‘bullied’ on climate science","bodyText":"Australia’s deputy prime minister has refused to say he accepts key findings of the latest global summary of climate science, declaring he won’t be “berated” or participate in a “kangaroo court”. Barnaby Joyce, leader of the junior Coalition party whose agreement will be needed if Australia is to take a more ambitious climate policy to the Glasgow conference in November, said he would not yield to “straight-out bullying”. “I can say and think what I like,” he said on Friday. Joyce, who was reinstated as leader of the Nationals in June, likened basic questions about climate science to a baptism where parents were required to “denounce Satan and all his works and deeds”. Joyce did not rule out the Nationals doing a deal with Scott Morrison’s Liberal party to firmly commit to net zero emissions by 2050, but said: “In any deal, I don’t start by saying what I think it’s worth, I start by saying how much do you want it?” He said the prime minister – who has said it is his “preference” to achieve net zero by midcentury, and is facing increasing diplomatic heat from the UK and the US – was “giving his best endeavours to this process” but any long-term emissions strategy would require the “concurrence” of National party MPs and senators. During a National Press Club event held at parliament house on Friday, Guardian Australia asked Joyce whether he accepted the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest reports. He was presented with three statements from the IPCC’s 40-page summary for policymakers, including: “It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.” The other quotes from the report (pdf) were that human influence “has warmed the climate at a rate that is unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years” and that global heating “of 1.5C and 2C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades”. He was also asked whether he accepted that the intensity, frequency and duration of fire weather events were projected to increase throughout Australia – a form of words drawn from the IPCC’s two-page regional fact sheet on Australasia (pdf). Asked whether he accepted that was our best understanding of the science, Joyce said: “I really don’t like when questions are presented like that, because it sounds like you’re at a baptism, on behalf of your child, denouncing Satan and all of his works and deeds, and on and on and on it goes.” Joyce added: “If the question you ask me is I do I believe that humans have an influence on climate, yes I do.” He did not specify how much of an influence he accepted humans had on the climate. “And if you then walk into the frame of saying, ‘I’m now going to grab you by the ear and make you comply with everything I say’, I won’t do that because it’s a free nation. I can say and think what I like.” Asked whether he had read the IPCC report, published early last month, Joyce said he had “been through whole sections of that report” but “this turns into this sort of parochial partisan process”. He said he was “not going to stand here and sort of be berated into complying” with such statements. “I’m not going to participate in some sort of kangaroo court of now you will agree to every statement I say because the IPCC said it,” Joyce said. In response to a subsequent question from another journalist about a long-term emission reduction strategy, which the government has promised to unveil before the Glasgow summit, Joyce suggested regional Australia was “bruised and beaten by the Kyoto process”. He said the Nationals would work to ensure that urban Australia, not regional Australia, paid the price “if there’s a price to be paid”. “This is why in regards to the previous question [about climate science], why we get so annoyed, because people say you must comply with my assertion, and that therefore justifies everything that I want to do next, because otherwise I just go back to the initial statement and say but didn’t you say this, therefore you must comply with that,” Joyce said. “And that’s bullying.” The Australian government is yet to firmly commit to net zero emissions by 2050 or to deepen its Abbott-era emission reduction pledge for 2030, although some members of the Liberals are pressing for Morrison to increase Australia’s ambition. Joyce defended coal and gas exports, saying it was a big export earner for Australia. He said it would be a “childish decision” to stop such exports while expecting to maintain the same standard of living.

His comments follow the Biden administration moving in June to ban US imports of a key solar panel material from a Chinese-based company over forced labour allegations. Joyce questioned whether Australians thought about the polysilicon that was produced “by reason of the slave labour by the Uyghur people”. He said: “When you go and turn on the lights, do you think slave labour?” Joyce’s comments are starkly different from those of Morrison, who said last month that the government was “very aware of the risks that are set out in the IPCC report”. “The cost of inaction globally is very clear in what the IPCC report sets out today,” Morrison said at the time, and promised that the government would “set out a clear plan”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/apr/15/china-must-shut-600-coal-fired-plants-to-hit-climate-target","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-14T23:01:19Z","webTitle":"China ‘must shut 600 coal-fired plants’ to hit climate target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/15/china-must-shut-600-coal-fired-plants-to-hit-climate-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/apr/15/china-must-shut-600-coal-fired-plants-to-hit-climate-target","fields":{"headline":"China ‘must shut 600 coal-fired plants’ to hit climate target","bodyText":"China must shut down nearly 600 of its coal-fired power plants in the next 10 years, replacing them with renewable electricity generation, to meet its goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2060, a report has said. But replacing the 364GW of coal generation with renewable power would achieve a net saving of $1.6tn (£1.2tn) over the period, since wind and solar power are now much cheaper than coal, according to the analysis company TransitionZero. The coal consumption of China, the world’s biggest emitter, is of global concern. The country has ramped up plans for new coal-fired power stations in an effort to spur economic growth after the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Last September the country’s president, Xi Jinping, surprised the world by pledging that China would achieve net zero emissions by 2060, and that its emissions would peak before 2030. However, while climate experts have applauded the long-term goal they are concerned that allowing emissions to rise for the next 10 years will bust the global carbon budget. Matthew Gray, the co-chief executive of TransitionZero, said: “If China fails on coal, the rest of the world will fail on containing dangerous climate change. But the stars are now somewhat aligning on breaking China’s addiction to coal.” The finding that China could save money in both the short and longer term by replacing coal with renewable energy brightens the prospect of it moving decisively away from coal in the next few years. Al Gore, who wrote a foreword to the TransitionZero analysis, said: “This shows that not only can China meet their climate goals, the country and its leaders can accelerate them rapidly. The economic opportunity presented by a transition from coal to clean energy shows that climate action and economic growth go hand in hand.” China is preparing to submit a new climate plan, called a nationally determined contribution, or NDC. Such plans are a requirement for all countries under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and will form the key part of Cop26, the vital UK climate talks taking place in Glasgow this November. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, has urged China to move swiftly away from coal, but the International Energy Agency has warned that China’s coal consumption is rebounding strongly after the shock of Covid-19. Gray said the transition away from coal would still be difficult politically since the fuel was “deeply embedded” in China’s economy and society. Vast amounts of infrastructure, from railways carrying coal from mines across the country, to steel and cement plants, are reliant on coal today. The new report, said Gray, did not examine jobs in detail, but he said a transition from coal to clean energy in China was likely to create as many, if not more, jobs as had been lost in traditional coal industries. “Moving to net zero will be jobs intensive,” he said. Reducing the country’s reliance on coal would also bring many health benefits, for instance by cutting air pollution, and go some way to easing looming water shortages in central Chinese regions, Gray added. Coal-fired power stations require vast quantities of water, in increasingly water-stressed regions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/may/29/sean-paul-interview-new-generation-dancehall-scorcha-jamaica-republic","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-29T10:00:04Z","webTitle":"Sean Paul: ‘A new generation are making dancehall their own’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/29/sean-paul-interview-new-generation-dancehall-scorcha-jamaica-republic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/may/29/sean-paul-interview-new-generation-dancehall-scorcha-jamaica-republic","fields":{"headline":"Sean Paul: ‘A new generation are making dancehall their own’","bodyText":"Sean Paul is a party-starter. Few artists have a back catalogue better primed for the dancefloor than the multimillion-selling Jamaican artist. This year marks 20 years since his breakout second album, Dutty Rock, took the syncopated, bass-driven genre of dancehall global with hits Get Busy, Like Glue and Gimme the Light. In the ensuing years, Paul has had three US No 1s, a Grammy and collaborations with the biggest names in pop, including Beyoncé, Sia, Dua Lipa and Little Mix. Now he is readying for the release of his eighth album, Scorcha. It plays like peak Paul: undulating bass and tripping rhythms backing up energetic lyrics on the subject of girls and ganja. It’s well-trodden territory, drawing on his decades of experience whipping the dancefloor into a frenzy. Yet Paul is now 49 and a father of two – five-year-old Levi Blaze and two-year-old Remi – and his life has expanded beyond the bravado; outside his music, there is more to him than just the party. Perhaps there always was. On a muggy afternoon, we meet in an airless room at the Observer office. Paul is surrounded by his black-clad entourage and decked out in the signifiers of opulent success: gold chains, box-fresh Burberry kicks, a diamond pinky ring so large it’s a miracle his wrist remains intact, gold fangs covering his incisors and a pair of shades. Look and listen longer, though, and his brash surface starts to fragment: there are flecks of grey in his beard, he smells of jasmine, not smoke, and when he speaks, his instantly recognisable baritone is thoughtful, measured and soft. Born Sean Paul Ryan Francis Henriques in Kingston, Jamaica in 1973, he struggled to find his place growing up. “From 13 to 19 years old, me and my brother spent our lives just trying to fit in,” he tells me, his dark glasses revealing a glimpse of his watery eyes. “We didn’t belong. I wanted to write about the social differences in Kingston, as that’s what I had experienced, but the party boy, the girl songs – that was just what people wanted.” Prior to his teenage years, Paul lived a relatively uneventful life in the middle-class Uptown district of Kingston. His parents were both champion swimmers – his father held the national butterfly record and his mother was breaststroke champion – and they instilled in him a love of water sports, which culminated in Paul representing Jamaica at water polo from the age of 13 to 21. His aunt ran a sound system with her husband, who was a member of the ska band the Vagabonds, and at weekends the family would set up shop on their grandmother’s lawn, charging entry for punters to dance to the latest dub and reggae mixes. “It was a party place and that was the first time I realised: I love this shit,” Paul says with a rumbling laugh. “It was exciting to watch people do what my grandma would call ‘the naughtiness’: the close dancing and smoking and drinking. Those were the proper house parties I wrote about later in songs like Get Busy.” Amid the partying, though, things were beginning to destabilise at home. Paul’s father was one of seven children born to one of the leading historic Jamaican families, the Henriques, and he was the black sheep. “My dad got this reputation of being an Uptown bad boy,” Paul says. “He would hang out in the ghettos and smoke marijuana a lot. He didn’t want a job beneath his cousins in the family, he wanted to make it for himself. So he was always trying to hustle and he kept getting in trouble.” When Paul was 13, his father was arrested on charges of manslaughter and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. “I lost my dad and I couldn’t understand when I would ever see him again, since a 15-year sentence was longer than my entire life at that point,” Paul says. His mother struggled to keep him and his brother at their private school and they ended up at Wolmer’s public school in Downtown, thrust into a new facet of Kingston life. “We would venture into the ghetto and smoke the chalice pipe and people would look at us and say, ‘You guys are privileged’, even though we couldn’t always afford gas for the car and the roof in our house was leaking,” Paul says. “Still, these people were really suffering. They lived in a zinc shack and it made me realise that I did not have it bad at all.” With his father in jail and Paul adjusting to the nuances of a newfound status – too privileged for the ghetto and too poor for private school – he looked to other father figures for inspiration. “I followed successful sportspeople, like Michael Jordan and Mike Tyson,” Paul says. “But my main inspiration was Bob Marley. His son Damian was in the same year as my brother, so I was very aware of their family’s presence, but when I was 17 I really began paying attention to what he was saying in his songs.” In Marley’s socially conscious lyrics, Paul saw the means of expressing his own reality, but where Marley was writing to the aortic pulse of reggae, Paul began to write his verses to the frenetic thump of modern dancehall, which had come out of Kingston clubs and the sound system culture. By the time Paul was 19, his father was released from jail for good behaviour and he had a handful of demos to share with him. “I was determined to talk about the disparity of Uptown and Downtown,” he says. “But producers would look at me and say, ‘You’re a face boy, an Uptown kid, why are you singing about poor people’s problems that nobody’s gonna believe?’” In the face of mounting rejections, college assignments for his course in hotel management and water polo competitions, Paul says his resolve to tackle social injustices through music started to waver. “I got to the point where I was just hustling – I was charging to do vocal features on any tracks and in 1996, I decided to write a song about girls,” he says. That song became Baby Girl, a sparse, singsong track on which Paul entreats his love interest to let him comfort her. It was a smash hit on Jamaican radio and in the clubs. The price for those vocal features soon went up and he decided to quit water polo to focus on music. “It was a sensation and ever since 1996, it’s been a different life,” he says. “Suddenly, I was a one-hit wonder and I knew I had to follow it up. People told me it wouldn’t last and that lit a fire in me to prove them wrong.” Paul tasked himself with writing and recording one song a day, beginning a six-year period of minimal sleep, fuelled by his hunger to produce new hits. He has since embraced collaboration, working with pop acts such as the Saturdays while keeping his patois flow intact, ultimately helping to cement dancehall as a global genre. Its rhythms can now be felt underpinning everything from Drake’s Controlla to Justin Bieber’s Sorry and Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You. As the genre takes off and assimilates into pop, though, Paul is concerned that a lack of recognition of its roots means dancehall is at risk of being diluted beyond recognition. “I’ve been extremely successful but I still don’t think people respect my footprint and the dancehall footprint in the business,” Paul says. “People say, ‘Dancehall is not getting on the radio any more’, but Ed Sheeran, Shawn Mendes, French Montana, they’re all doing it – they just don’t give the genre the credit to say, ‘This is my dancehall single.’” Indeed, when Bieber was questioned in 2021 about the use of his syncopated rhythms on the single Sorry, he simply labelled it “island music”. * * * While certain artists might shy away from genre designations out of fear of being pigeonholed, Paul sees the dancehall tag as a key facet of his and his peers’ identities and a flag to fly in the face of others who perhaps overlook their contributions. “Before the pandemic, I got tired of recording the pop features,” he says. “When we do a foreign collaboration, it’s always us working the record extra hard and they’re never too involved. They don’t care. We need to celebrate ourselves as the dancehall community instead – people like Beenie Man and Shaggy and Shabba Ranks, they all need their accolades – otherwise people just say Drake is innovative. No. It’s our rhythms and it’s our lingo in their music.” Much of that lingo has now become commonplace singalong fare, even if the majority of Paul’s international audiences might have no idea what it means. In the early 2000s, during one of his many songwriting sessions, Paul wrote some of his most famous lines, based on his experiences clubbing in New York the previous week. “I sang, ‘Just gimme the light and pass the dro/Buss another bokkle a Moë’ [“pass the homegrown/ Open another bottle of Moët”]. Next thing, it’s on MTV and every radio station,” he says. But he wasn’t immediately pleased. “I was embarrassed at first. I used to have songs with bridges, but this is just a quick hook and two verses that kept repeating. It felt so simple.” That song, Gimme the Light, was Paul’s first international hit, charting in the Top 10 in the US and UK. It taught Paul a lasting lesson about his role in the music industry. “I was having fun in the booth when I wrote it and I realised people could feel that vibe when they heard it, they wanted to have the same party experience,” he says. “I accepted that if this is me, then this is me. This is what I have to offer to the music game.” He harnessed that freestyle, easygoing recording method and stardom followed. R&amp;B singer Blu Cantrell featured Paul on her 2003 UK No 1, Breathe, and a newly solo Beyoncé enlisted Paul to feature on her single Baby Boy. When he was listening to the instrumental for the Beyoncé session in his car, a mango dropped through the sunroof and into his lap. “You don’t get a better sign than that,” Paul says with a laugh. The fruit may have been a flash of Newtonian inspiration but there were also other, more serious interventions needed. “From 96 to 2002, I was just having fun but it soon got me into some pretty stupid times,” he says with a pause. “It was too much drinking, like getting up and going to the bottle of Hennessy in the hotel room. There were a lot of girls too, which is awesome, but after a while I realised, this is just too much everything. It could be killing me.” Paul tempered the excess and settled down with Jodi Stewart, whom he married in 2012, but he kept producing the pleasure-seeking tunes the public craved from him. “I’m not doing a song a day now, but I still do a lot of music,” he says. “Scorcha has 16 tracks and I just did an album with 16 tracks [Live N Livin] in March 2021. I’m recording new music for the next record too. It doesn’t really stop and when I get into the studio mode, I’ll do five songs in a row.” * * * Paul’s immense work ethic doesn’t always pay off: Full Frequency, from 2014, for instance, sold fewer than 5,000 copies in the US, leading Paul to part ways with his label and to briefly become an independent artist again. But he took the opportunity to cannily reinvent himself through a series of pop-leaning guest features in the ensuing years – from British group Clean Bandit’s chart-topping single Rockabye in 2016, to Sia’s Cheap Thrills that same year, and the Dua Lipa feature No Lie in 2017. In Jamaica, new dancehall acts are crossing over into the mainstream, especially female artists. “I’m really proud to see the ladies work the business, as there used to only be a handful, and now there are so many coming up and finding success,” he enthuses. “One of the most exciting stories in Jamaican music right now is Shenseea. She’s a package for me – she sings well and she can spit hardcore when she’s ready.” He also namechecks singers Koffee, Jada Kingdom and Naomi Cowan as ones to watch. “This music is all about reflecting what is happening in your community and the new generation are making it their own,” he says. Indeed, with his own children and the spectre of the school run looming when he returns from this press tour, Paul is spending increasing amounts of time outside the studio thinking about the fate of future generations. Since contributing to the 2015 fundraising single Love Song to Earth, he has noticed the effects of global heating getting closer to home, including Hellshire beach in Kingston slowly disappearing. “When people talk about reaching a point of not being able to go back, I think we’re pretty much past it, so we need to act now to do whatever we can,” he says. He has just finished fitting out his home with solar power and is planning to change to electric cars. Equally, after Prince William and Kate Middleton’s gaffe-prone Caribbean Commonwealth tour, where they faced calls to make Jamaica a republic and to pay reparations for slavery, Paul has also been thinking about the political future of his country. “It’s weird for me because my grandmother is from Coventry and she feels a strong connection to the royal family – she woke up at 4am to watch Prince Charles and Diana get married and she still has the cups with their faces on,” he says with a laugh. “But then my friends who live in the ghetto feel like, what are they doing for us? So I understand both sides. Emotionally, there is a nostalgia there but as an adult, I feel like: what is it for?” At 98, his grandmother will be waiting for his visit when Paul returns, perhaps with a plate of the bubble and squeak she used to make for him as a child. “We’re all mixed up as a family – we have the Henriques on my dad’s side and then my grandmother who married a Chinese Jamaican man and came to Jamaica in the 50s,” he says. “I see the positives in the whole mix – we really have to celebrate each other while we have the time.” Perhaps this is Paul’s finally realised act of consciousness. It’s in the party, in the mix, that we come together; it’s to his music that we can put aside our differences and dance.

Effectively, in my head, I wasn’t going back to music,” she says. She’s speaking to Guardian Australia over Zoom from her home in Oxfordshire in England. It’s early morning and her camera is switched off because, by her own description, she “looks like death”. Imbruglia was just 16 in 1992 when she was cast as Beth Brennan on Neighbours. But if her name is familiar to you, it’s more likely because of Torn: a cover of a 1995 song by US band Ednaswap that turned Imbruglia into a global pop sensation two years later. Her version became one of the most-played songs ever on UK and Australian radio and sold more than 4m copies worldwide. Left of the Middle, the debut album that followed, sold 7m, swept Australia’s Aria awards and was nominated for a Grammy. It was a path Imbruglia mapped out almost to the letter as a teenager at home in Berkeley Vale on the New South Wales Central Coast. “I remember writing this wishlist in my bedroom that said, I want to be on Neighbours, E Street, or Home &amp; Away,” she recalls. “Then I’m gonna make music, then I’m gonna be a movie star.” But fame wasn’t all it was cracked up to be. Being a global celebrity, she has previously said, left her “successful, rich and terribly unhappy”. “It was daunting,” she remembers now. “I was going around and winning awards and I didn’t have a lot of confidence. It was this weird combination of trying to step up and own it, and also not really thinking you’re that great. So there were mixed emotions. I see pictures of myself at that time and I just want to give me a hug, because I think it was a lot.” Torn’s success also invited some criticism. Ednaswap, the band who wrote the original, weren’t thrilled by her take. “I met them and they were quite bitter about it, at the beginning,” she says. “After it came out they were like, ‘That’s not really what we had in mind for the song.’ And it’s like, well, you would have had to sign off on me singing it for one, so there’s that. And [then there’s] the money you made.” (In a previous interview, Ednaswap’s Anne Preven and Scott Cutler described Torn as a “massive financial windfall” that yielded multiple six-figure royalty cheques; Cutler admitted that while he wasn’t a fan at first, “I love [Imbruglia’s version] now.”) Imbruglia invited the band to work with her on her second album – but that ended badly too. She “walked out” of the sessions, she says, and hasn’t talked to the band since. After relocating to London, Imbruglia released two more albums and acted in a few films, including the James Bond spoof Johnny English. But by 2008, not everything was going to plan. After five years of marriage, she divorced from Silverchair frontman Daniel Johns; while the pair remain friends, being newly single in her mid-30s rattled her. “I spent a lot of time after that trying to settle down, find a guy, start a family,” she says. “I [thought] another relationship might be the answer.” And then, in 2009 – after years spent working on her fourth album Come to Life – Imbruglia was dropped by her label Island Records before it got a global release. “I’d made this super-cool album ... and they kept trying to change it and make it more poppy,” she says. “Just that typical music industry bullshit … to have it not get a proper release really broke my heart. That was difficult for me.” It was at this point she considered quitting altogether. “I really thought the universe was telling me not to make music,” Imbruglia says. She returned to Australia for a period of soul-searching – and a hosting gig on X Factor – and spent time in nature around Queensland’s Currumbin Creek. Eventually she went to Los Angeles to study acting, landing roles in a trio of independent films, and in 2015 she released an album of cover songs, before finding her way back to writing her own. Now, Imbruglia is gearing up to release Firebird: her first album of originals in more than a decade. She describes the record as a celebration of independence, strength and overcoming; as the start of a new chapter. “I realised [music] is my first love. I might not be the best songwriter, but what I am is a communicator of emotion and I think it’s valid,” Imbruglia says. “The fact that it’s taken this long is just typical me, unfortunately.” In 2019, Imbruglia welcomed her first child as a solo parent, after revealing to Instagram that she had become pregnant after undergoing IVF with donor sperm. The album finds Imbruglia optimistic and at peace with the universe, whether it’s reflecting on the joy of having something to lose on Maybe it’s Great or cheering for being “older and wiser” in the chorus of On My Way. On the KT Tunstall collaboration Nothing Missing, Imbruglia sings about realising she is already whole without a partner, an “epiphany” that landed before the birth of her son. Her comeback has another dimension too: it aligns with the zeitgeist. A wave of new pop acts are embracing the sort of breezy guitar pop music Imbruglia helped popularise around the turn of the century, including Rina Sawayama and Slayyyter; and Lorde covered Torn during a TV appearance this year, name-checking Imbruglia as an inspiration for her new album, Solar Power. Imbruglia hasn’t yet listened, but is happy to be a reference point. “I think [Lorde] is a genius and it’s very flattering,” she laughs. “Lucky me that the 90s is trending.” But she wasn’t interested in returning to that sound herself. Instead, Firebird is a sonic mixed bag – pop music fused with country, electronic and rock influences – that was guided by Imbruglia’s own tastes as well as the input of collaborators including the Strokes guitarist Albert Hammond Jnr. Signed to a new label this time around, Imbruglia didn’t have to contend with external opinions about what she should sound like, or “write for algorithms”. “I think that the ups and downs that I’ve been through have landed me where I am now, and I’m super-proud of Firebird. Making it has been the most joyful, creative experience. So I wouldn’t change a thing.” Plus, she says, “I try to remember the highs more than the lows. And I’m having a high at the moment.” • Firebird by Natalie Imbruglia is out 24 September through BMG"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/nov/16/cop-26-big-business-climate-crisis-neoliberal","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-16T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"The Cop26 message?

We are trusting big business, not states, to fix the climate crisis","bodyText":"Cop26 delivered no big climate deal. Nor, in truth, was there any reason to expect one. The drastic measures that might – at a stroke – open a path to climate stability are not viable in political or diplomatic terms. Like climate breakdown itself, this is a fact to be reckoned with, a fact not just about “politicians”, but about the polities of which we are all, like it or not, a part. The step from the scientific recognition of a climate emergency to societal agreement on radical action is still too great. All that the negotiators at Cop26 could manage was makeshift. When it comes to climate finance, the gap between what is needed and what is on the table is dizzying. The talk at the conference was all about the annual $100bn (£75bn) that rich countries had promised to poorer nations back in 2009. The rich countries have now apologised for falling short. The new resolution is to make up the difference by 2022 and then negotiate a new framework. It is symbolically important and of some practical help. But, as everyone knows, it falls laughably short of what is necessary. John Kerry, America’s chief negotiator, said so himself in a speech to the CBI. It isn’t billions we need, it is trillions. Somewhere between $2.6tn and $4.6tn every year in funding for low-income countries to mitigate and adapt to the crisis. Those are figures, Kerry went on to say, no government in the world is going to match. Not America. Not China. We should take the hint. There isn’t going to be a big green Marshall plan. Nor are Europe or Japan going to come up with trillions in government money either. The solution, if there is to be one, is not going to come from rich governments shouldering the global burden on national balance sheets. So, how does Kerry propose to close the gap? As far as he is concerned, the solution is private business. Hence the excitement about the $130tn that Mark Carney claims to have rallied in the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a coalition of banks, asset managers, pension and insurance funds. Lending by that group will not be concessional. The trillions, Kerry insisted to his Glasgow audience, will earn a proper rate of return. But how then will they flow to low-income countries? After all, if there was a decent chance of making profit by wiring west Africa for solar power, the trillions would already be at work. For that, Larry Fink of BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, has a ready answer. He can direct trillions towards the energy transition in low-income countries, if the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are there to “derisk” the lending, by absorbing the first loss on projects in Africa, Latin America and Asia. Even more money will flow if there is a carbon price that gives clean energy a competitive advantage. It is a neat solution, the same neat neoliberal solution that has been proffered repeatedly since the 1990s. The same solution that has not been delivered. Talk of carbon pricing evokes the bitter memory of shock therapy in eastern Europe and the developing world. BlackRock’s backstop idea is the logic of the 2008 bank bailouts expanded to the global level – socialise the risks, privatise the profits. At this point those promising trillions in private funding to fight the climate crisis reveal themselves to be the true utopians, just utopians of a neoliberal variety. Carbon pricing – a fee placed on emissions – may be the economists’ favourite. The one place where it may work, ironically, is in Europe, where energy is already heavily taxed and the most sophisticated welfare states in the world can cushion the impact. China is experimenting with the largest carbon market yet. But as a global proposition, a single minimum carbon price is a non-starter, first and foremost in the US, whose economists invented the idea. Nor is Congress or any European parliament about to vote in favour of hundreds of billions of dollars to backstop BlackRock. Western states carried out bailouts in 2008 and again in 2020. But those were desperate efforts, faute de mieux, to save the status quo at home. And that was toxic enough. Stretched to a global scale, it has zero political appeal. However, the risk is not that Cop26 opens the door to some gigantic neoliberal climate stitch-up, but instead that we remain locked in our current impasse, careening towards catastrophe. Faced with that prospect, both the US and the EU seem less preoccupied with grand schemes of carbon pricing and blended finance, than with pushing a case-by-case approach. Four separate initiatives show the direction of travel. The deal on aluminium and steel announced by the EU and the US ends one of Trump’s more absurd trade wars and turns it into a process for agreeing on accounting rules for carbon. What seems to be envisioned is a hi-tech, clean-steel trade zone, with tariffs imposed on high-carbon imports from China, Russia and Ukraine. It isn’t a global carbon price, but a sectoral rich-country buyers’ club. On coal, though the final declaration was disappointing, the US is working with India to promote the rollout of renewables. This involves a three-way partnership with the UAE to provide technical assistance and finance to speed up the move away from coal. India is not the only emerging market with a coal problem. One of the best pieces of news out of Cop26 was the multinational $8.5bn package to support the winding down of coal burning by Eskom, South Africa’s bankrupt and dysfunctional power utility. To accelerate the pace of industrial change, history tells us that the key is to incentivise first movers – leading firms that adopt new technologies and thus send the message to their competitors: innovate or be left behind. In unleashing a race to the top, the announcement of the First Movers Coalition in November, backed by the US and the World Economic Forum and involving firms like shipping giant Maersk and Cemex and Holcim, two of the world’s leading cement makers, is potentially a significant step. Finally, there is the deal to cut emissions of methane, the long-neglected but deadly greenhouse gas, by 30% by 2030. That will involve a technological push across the oil and gas industry worldwide. Advocates of the Green New Deal have long urged big government-led industrial policy. The approach of Kerry and his team seems to follow a more low-key, pragmatic script. As Danny Cullenward and David Victor write in their book, Making Climate Policy Work, rather than attempting a contentious grand bargain, the key is to find coalitions of the willing and drive change sector by sector, raising ambition through repeated rounds of bargaining. Like the Paris agreement of 2015, which first demonstrated this pragmatic approach in action, the Kerry initiatives face two big questions. Will a series of ad hoc measures add up to an adequate overall solution? Furthermore, not every deal can be win-win. How will the tough trade-offs be fought out? Whose interests will be served? The reply by the pragmatists is that no general answer can be given in advance. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. It is not much of an answer. But, as Cop26 attests, it may be the only realistic one. If that is the case, then the response of the climate movement should be to keep up the pressure. In political terms, pragmatic ad hocery may be realistic, but there is no negotiating with the dwindling carbon budget. Given how deeply entrenched the status quo is, the temptation to conservative wishful thinking is everywhere. Someone has to pound the message home. The biggest risk is not to change.

Homeowners who install new rooftop solar panels from 1 January 2020 will be able to lower their bills by selling the energy they do not need to their supplier. A record was set at noon on a Friday in May 2017, when solar energy supplied around a quarter of the UK’s electricity. However, solar panel owners are not always at home on sunny days to reap the benefit. The new rules will allow them to make money if they generate electricity for the grid. Some 800,000 householders with solar panels already benefit from payments under a previous scheme. However, the subsidies were controversially scrapped by the government in April, causing the number of new installations to fall by 94% in May from the month before. Labour accused the government last week of “actively dismantling” the solar industry. The sector will still struggle this summer as the change does not come in for another seven months, so homeowners have no incentive to buy panels this year. Chris Skidmore, the minister for energy and clean growth, said the government wanted to increase the number of small-scale generators without adding the cost of subsidies to energy bills. “The future of energy is local and the new smart export guarantee will ensure households that choose to become green energy generators will be guaranteed a payment for electricity supplied to the grid,” he said. The government also hopes to encourage homes with solar panels to install batteries. Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus Energy, said: “These smart export tariffs are game-changing when it comes to harnessing the power of citizens to tackle climate change”. A few suppliers, including Octopus, already offer to buy solar power from their customers. “They mean homes and businesses can be paid for producing clean electricity just like traditional generators, replacing old dirty power stations and pumping more renewable energy into the grid. This will help bring down prices for everyone as we use cheaper power generated locally by our neighbours,” Jackson said. Léonie Greene, a director at the Solar Trade Association, said it was “vital” that even “very small players” were paid a fair price. “We will be watching the market like a hawk to see if competitive offers come forward that properly value the power that smart solar homes can contribute to the decarbonising electricity grid,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/aug/09/worst-polluting-countries-must-make-drastic-carbon-cuts-says-cop26-chief","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-09T16:55:35Z","webTitle":"Worst polluting countries must make drastic carbon cuts, says Cop26 chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/09/worst-polluting-countries-must-make-drastic-carbon-cuts-says-cop26-chief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/aug/09/worst-polluting-countries-must-make-drastic-carbon-cuts-says-cop26-chief","fields":{"headline":"Worst polluting countries must make drastic carbon cuts, says Cop26 chief","bodyText":"The world’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases must produce clear plans to cut their carbon output drastically, the president of vital UN climate talks has urged, after scientists warned there was only a small chance of escaping the worst ravages of climate breakdown. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change set out the starkest warning yet on the widespread and “unprecedented” changes to the climate that are “unequivocally” the result of human actions. Extreme weather resulting from these changes was already seen around the world and growing worse, in the form of rising temperatures, more frequent and fiercer storms, heatwaves, droughts, floods and sea level rises, according to the biggest assessment of climate science in eight years. Global temperatures were likely to top 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in the next two decades, the threshold set as the ambition of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the world’s climate science authority said. Only sharp and immediate cuts in greenhouse gases this decade could stabilise the climate system. Alok Sharma, the UK minister who will preside over the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow this November, said countries must act. “If ever there was going to be a wake-up call to the world when it comes to climate change, this report is it. But the future is not yet written. The very worst of climate change is still avoidable.” The Paris climate agreement ambition of limiting warming to 1.5C, and staving off the worst impacts of climate breakdown, was “still achievable, but retreating and retreating fast”, he said. “What we really need now is for all major emitters to play their part, and the G20 are going to be absolutely key to our 1.5C future,” he added. G20 governments, comprising the world’s biggest economies and including developed and developing countries, are responsible for about 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and about 85% of GDP. Sharma did not single out particular governments, but those yet to put forward plans for emissions cuts before Cop26 include China, India and Brazil. The spotlight now falls firmly on China, the world’s biggest emitter and second largest economy, and the biggest producer and consumer of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. “This must be the Cop that consigns coal to history,” said Sharma. Helen Mountford, the vice-president of climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, said this decade was “truly our last chance” of keeping to a relatively safe climate, and the actions of leading emitters would be crucial. “It’s imperative for China to announce more stringent emission reductions than it has hinted at thus far,” she said. China has set out a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2060, and has said its emissions will peak by 2030. But the government still plans new coal-fired power plants, and its reliance on coal returned after a slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, despite the falling price of wind and solar power making them cheaper than coal. The International Energy Agency has warned that global emissions will rise next year by a record amount, largely driven by a resurgence in coal in China. Bernice Lee, the research director for futures at the Chatham House thinktank, said: “Coal in China is indeed a deal-breaker when it comes to 1.5C, as John Kerry said a couple of weeks ago. Luckily, the economics of coal versus renewables should make this an easier lift for China.” For China to come forward with new commitments on emissions, the actions of the US would be key, argued Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington DC. The US president, Joe Biden, has vowed to halve US emissions by 2030, provide billions in climate finance to poor countries and initiate a sweeping programme of incentives and regulations to stimulate a low-carbon economy. “The US Congress must pass President Biden’s ambitious climate plan ahead of Cop26, to both lock in strong American action and put added pressure on China and other major emitters to finally cut their emissions,” he said. “Without both the US and China making deep emissions cuts, the Paris targets cannot be achieved.” While China will now be a clear focus, other big emitters in the G20 such as India, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa will also be key targets of the UK’s climate diplomacy in the two and a half months remaining before Cop26. The voices of poor countries must also be heard, insisted Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a former president of Liberia and member of the Elders group of senior former leaders. “We see the climate crisis already unfolding before our eyes and for people in the global south this is an emergency we are already living through. As the scientific evidence mounts, so too does the need to address the concerns vulnerable countries are raising,” she said. “The science is robust; the response to this environmental and human rights emergency needs to be just as solid.” Diann Black-Layne, Antigua and Barbuda’s ambassador for climate change and the lead climate negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, said it was “essential that global powers and major emitters heed the scientific evidence and take action” on greenhouse gases, as well as providing financial help to poor countries. She said: “The IPCC confirms the experience of small island states: that cyclones are getting more intense, and that sea levels are rising, but it also confirms that we can still curb the worst of it. The stark fact is that if we keep warming to 1.5C we are still facing half a metre of sea level rise. But if we stop warming from reaching 2C, we can avoid a long-term three metres of sea level rise. That is our very future, right there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"mazda-sustainable-style/2021/aug/11/breaking-the-mould-the-philosophy-behind-mazdas-first-electric-vehicle-and-the-woman-leading-the-way","type":"article","sectionId":"mazda-sustainable-style","sectionName":"Mazda: Sustainable style","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-11T03:24:29Z","webTitle":"Breaking the mould: the philosophy behind Mazda’s first electric vehicle - and the woman leading the way","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/mazda-sustainable-style/2021/aug/11/breaking-the-mould-the-philosophy-behind-mazdas-first-electric-vehicle-and-the-woman-leading-the-way","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/mazda-sustainable-style/2021/aug/11/breaking-the-mould-the-philosophy-behind-mazdas-first-electric-vehicle-and-the-woman-leading-the-way","fields":{"headline":"Breaking the mould: the philosophy behind Mazda’s first electric vehicle - and the woman leading the way","bodyText":"Mazda has a long history of breaking the rules for the best reasons. Wakako Uefuji is its second female program lead, having taken the reins from Tomiko Takeuchi to continue the rich philosophy of Jinba-Ittai – the effortless bond between driver and vehicle. We spoke to Uefuji, who is based in Japan, about what it means to lead a team that is transforming motoring without compromising on tradition. G: What influenced you to join Mazda? WU: Mazda was a local company that I loved and took pride in, as my father worked there as well. Wanting to be involved in plant construction, I applied to work in production engineering and was happy to be placed there. G: What has that experience been like? WU: My first 12 years with the company were spent predominantly working in painting production preparation for new models. I then took three years of maternity leave, during which I found myself connecting with people and society in new ways. I enjoyed time spent studying business management, volunteering and navigating the new challenges of motherhood. I like making things as well as interacting with people, which led me to a new role after returning from maternity leave, in charge of process innovating in finishing and assembly, leading a human-centric process design team. In April this year, I took on the role of program manager of Mazda’s first electric vehicle, the MX-30. I’m responsible for interacting with staff members across multiple departments company-wide, from development through to retail, and leading our team towards the ultimate goal of delivering a product that our customers will truly love. Mazda plans for electric vehicles to account for 25% of global production by 2030. G: How does your personal philosophy align with Jinba-Ittai? WU: We work tirelessly to create an experience in which the driver’s intentions and the vehicle response feel in sync with one another – as though the joy of driving is shared between the two, like the closeness of a rider with their horse. This is the kind of “effortless joyful driving” we seek to achieve through Jinba-Ittai. I’m no petrol head – I don’t know the ins and outs of cars and driving like these guys do – and I’m actually proud to say I probably see and understand cars from a similar perspective to most of our customers. I believe having a space that is just yours – a favourite spot where you can relax and calm your heart and mind when you need to take a breather – is another essential part of Jinba-Ittai. G: The MX-30 is Mazda’s first electric vehicle. What’s it like to be at the helm of this project? WU: We believe the heart of those who make the car is reflected in the finished product. We want to design and produce cars in a way that allows us to pour our hearts into each vehicle we send out. As the MX-30 program manager, I continue to build on the work of Tomiko Takeuchi and her team. I will help to bring the vehicle to customers so they can experience it for themselves, and to help staff and dealerships feel a sense of pride as they send the MX-30 into the world. G: How does the MX-30 speak to company plans for a sustainable and stylish future? WU: The previous MX-30 program manager, Ms Takeuchi, was determined to create a “car that embodies an entirely new set of values” and started the MX-30 program from a completely blank canvas, designing a brand new body type, powertrain and vehicle name. The MX-30 is a true masterpiece that has grown out of a long creative process centered around the concept of “living life true to oneself”. Mazda plans for all our vehicles to be equipped with electrification technology and for electric vehicles to account for 25% of global production by 2030. We’re taking a multi-solution approach that considers regional differences in electricity generation and ensures the technologies and products made in each region will contribute to the greatest reduction in emissions. The MX-30 Electric embodies Mazda’s philosophy of Jinba-Ittai – the effortless bond between driver and vehicle. The MX-30 is not only equipped with a variety of electrification technologies. We are using this model to challenge ourselves to expand the Mazda brand. Each MX-30 will be delivered to the customer with a full battery that has been charged using solar power generation equipment installed at our head office in Hiroshima. In its design, the MX-30 carefully balances shape, colour, materials and functionality. The interior cabin space has an ambience that calms the mind the moment you sit in the car. I remember stepping into it without any preconceptions, sitting in the driver’s seat for the first time, and being immediately drawn to its elegance and style and, at the same time, feeling my body relax. It is furnished using environmentally friendly materials including cork, vegan leather, recycled fabrics and other fibres made of recycled raw materials. It is the perfect fusion of style and sustainability. G: What excites you most about seeing the MX-30 out in the world? WU: Seeing people smile and say: “Thanks.” Knowing I can play even a small part in putting a true smile on someone’s face is my greatest joy and the driving force behind everything I do. And I want those of us who design, produce and deliver the MX-30 to keep a smile on our faces, too. It’s this sense of connection through shared enjoyment that excites me the most. Combining sustainable materials and clean engine technology, the Mazda MX-30 Electric is a vision for the future.

Construction is scheduled to start in 2028 in Al Wusta governorate on the Arabian Sea. It will be built in stages, with the aim to be at full capacity by 2038, powered by 25 gigawatts of wind and solar energy. The consortium of companies behind the $30bn (£21bn) project includes the state-owned oil and gas company OQ, the Hong Kong-based renewable hydrogen developer InterContinental Energy and the Kuwait-based energy investor Enertech. Once online, the plant will use renewable energy to split water in an electrolyser to produce green hydrogen, which is able to replace fossil fuels without producing carbon emissions. Most will be exported to Europe and Asia, said Alicia Eastman, the co-founder and president of InterContinental Energy, either as hydrogen or converted into green ammonia, which is easier to ship and store. The facility aims to produce 1.8m tonnes of green hydrogen and up to 10m tonnes of green ammonia a year. Oman currently relies heavily on fossil fuels, generating up to 85% of its GDP from oil and gas, but its fossil fuel reserves are dwindling and becoming increasingly costly to extract. In December 2020, the country published its Oman Vision 2040 strategy, a plan to diversify the economy away from fossil fuels and increase investment in renewables. Green hydrogen could play an important role, said Eastman, thanks to the Oman’s combination of plentiful daytime sun and strong winds at night. “Oman is one of the places in the world that I’ve called the ‘future renewable superpowers’,” said Michael Liebreich, the founder of BloombergNEF, “because what you really want [to produce green hydrogen] is very cheap solar and very cheap wind.” While electrification is the most efficient way of decarbonising most sectors, it’s limited when it comes to energy-intensive industries such as steel, chemicals, aviation and shipping. Green hydrogen will be vital to help fill these gaps, said the International Energy Agency in its report published this week, which called for an end to fossil fuel investments if governments are serious about climate commitments. A wave of net zero-emissions pledges has already led to a slew of hydrogen strategies, including from the European Commission in 2020, which predicted the share of hydrogen in the EU’s energy mix would rise from 2% to 14% by 2050. Yet green hydrogen currently makes up less than 1% of global hydrogen production. The majority is still produced using fossil fuels such as gas and coal, in a process that emits about 830m tonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to the emissions of the UK and Indonesia combined. “Blue hydrogen” is a cleaner version, as emissions are captured and stored, but it is still produced using gas – and is seen by some oil companies as a way to keep using fossil fuels. One of the stumbling blocks for green hydrogen has been cost, partly because of the huge amounts of energy required. But as renewables and electrolysers become cheaper, and fossil fuel prices rise, costs could fall by up to 64% by 2030, according to research from the consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “Most green hydrogen products will not be competitive for at least another decade,” said Falko Ueckerdt, a senior scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who sees the Oman project as “a sign that investors anticipate large future demands for hydrogen-based fuels after 2030”. Oman’s proposed plant is just one in a slate of green hydrogen mega projects planned globally. Eastman said InterContinental Energy has a number of other plants in the works, including a 26GW wind and solar green hydrogen plant in the Pilbara, Western Australia. If constructed, this $36bn (£25.5bn) plant would be the world’s biggest energy project. The first phase is expected to be online by 2028. In March, the renewables company Enegix Energy announced the construction of a green hydrogen plan in Ceará state, north-eastern Brazil. Once built, which the company estimates will take about four years, the plant would produce more than 600,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year from 3.4GW of wind and solar power. “People are upping the gigawatts, and they should,” said Eastman, “there’s so much room in the market.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/jun/09/shell-chief-vows-to-rise-to-challenge-but-feels-singled-out-on-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T17:21:40Z","webTitle":"Shell chief vows to bolster emissions strategy after court ruling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/09/shell-chief-vows-to-rise-to-challenge-but-feels-singled-out-on-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/jun/09/shell-chief-vows-to-rise-to-challenge-but-feels-singled-out-on-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Shell chief vows to bolster emissions strategy after court ruling","bodyText":"Royal Dutch Shell has vowed to accelerate its strategy towards becoming a net zero emissions business, two weeks after a Dutch court ruling ordered the company to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels. Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, promised to “rise to the challenge” in helping to create a low-carbon energy system, but came out fighting for the Anglo-Dutch oil company he runs, insisting it has been leading the industry in taking responsibility for its carbon emissions. In a statement on his LinkedIn page, Van Beurden said he was surprised by the court’s verdict and was “disappointed that Shell is being singled out by a ruling that I believe does not help reduce global CO2 emissions”. He added: “A court ordering one energy company to reduce its emissions – and the emissions of its customers – is not the answer.” The transition to low-carbon energy, which remained necessary to battle the climate emergency, was “far too big a challenge for one company to tackle”, he wrote, calling for clearer regulations and policies from global governments. Shell said it was reviewing the ruling handed down last month by a court in The Hague and expected to appeal. But the court has said its decision is immediately applicable and should not be suspended before an appeal. Shell’s oil production had probably peaked in 2019, Van Beurden said, adding that he believed the firm’s total absolute carbon emissions would decline from 2018 levels. Instead, he said Shell should work with its customers to help them find their own way to achieving net zero emissions. The oil firm said it would continue to produce oil and gas products “for a long time to come” in order to meet customer demand and retain the company’s financial strength, while also attracting investment. “Imagine Shell decided to stop selling petrol and diesel today. This would certainly cut Shell’s carbon emissions. But it would not help the world one bit,” Van Beurden wrote. “Demand for fuel would not change. People would fill up their cars and delivery trucks at other service stations.” The company said it had “rigorous, short-term reduction targets” on the way to its goal of becoming a net zero emissions business by 2050. The chief executive added that Shell had taken responsibility for reducing the carbon emissions it produced, as well as those produced when customers used its products. The landmark Dutch case was brought by the environmental group Friends of the Earth and more than 17,000 co-plaintiffs, who successfully argued that Shell had been aware of the dangerous consequences of CO2 emissions for decades, and that and its targets remained insufficiently robust. The company was told by the court that its emission reductions, along with those of its suppliers and buyers, should be brought into line with the Paris climate agreement. Although it intended to appeal against the ruling, Shell said it would “seek ways to reduce emissions even further in a way that remains purposeful and profitable”. As part of its energy transition strategy, Shell said it had in recent years invested “billions of dollars” in lower-carbon energy, including wind and solar power, hydrogen and biofuels. Shell has vowed to give investors a chance to vote on the progress of its transition strategy at every annual shareholder meeting. Van Beurden complained that the court hearing took place several months before the publication of the strategy. Shell faced a significant investor rebellion at its most recent AGM, when a shareholder resolution coordinated by Follow This, a Dutch climate activist group, calling for the company to set binding carbon emissions targets received 30% of votes. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said Van Beurden had “failed to have his epiphany moment, and still thinks that committing to the Paris agreement is an unfair ask. More stakeholders than ever are pushing for Paris-alignment and there comes a time when Shell will have to listen and act. Butvan Beurden can take comfort that Shell is not alone in this challenge.” Rachel Kennerley, an international climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said Shell’s promises did not far enough. She added: “If Mr van Beurden was as serious about this as he claims, he’d stop dismissing his company’s role in driving this devastating situation and would use the court ruling as an intervention to do the right thing, rather than appealing it with all of Shell’s corporate might.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/oct/04/surging-gas-prices-and-fuel-bills-focus-tory-minds-on-the-nuclear-option","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-04T05:00:48Z","webTitle":"Surging gas prices and fuel bills focus Tory minds on the nuclear option","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/04/surging-gas-prices-and-fuel-bills-focus-tory-minds-on-the-nuclear-option","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/oct/04/surging-gas-prices-and-fuel-bills-focus-tory-minds-on-the-nuclear-option","fields":{"headline":"Surging gas prices and fuel bills focus Tory minds on the nuclear option","bodyText":"Among the subjects preoccupying delegates at the Conservative party conference in Manchester on Monday, energy will be near the top of the list. Soaring global gas prices, a lack of windpower and surging household bills have focused minds on Britain’s energy needs – and the role of nuclear power in particular. For the past decade, Britain’s ambitions to build more nuclear power plants have been entwined with China’s. Hinkley Point C, the long-delayed and over-budget £23bn plant in Somerset that will be the first new power station in a generation, is being bankrolled with Chinese cash. China’s nuclear ambitions – at least as far as Britain is concerned – may be about to collide with a new political reality. Opponents of Chinese involvement in UK infrastructure are turning cartwheels at reports that the government is planning to eject the People’s Republic from Sizewell C – a £20bn sister to Sizewell B on the Suffolk coast, which is intended to power 6m homes. Beijing’s international nuclear ambitions have suffered a “body blow”, according to Iain Duncan Smith. The former Conservative party leader’s Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China campaigned, successfully, for the telecoms giant Huawei to be kicked out of the UK’s 5G network, after pressure from Donald Trump’s administration. “The British government has learned the hard way that we’re going to have to stand up to them,” he said. Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Sinosceptic China Research Group, hailed the “more realistic approach”. “Chinese state-owned companies shouldn’t be building nuclear power plants in Britain,” he said. “As the China Research Group has shown, Beijing’s attempts to interfere in other countries are growing and the UK should not make itself vulnerable.” The duo were reacting to suggestions, first reported in the Guardian, that officials are examining methods by which China General Nuclear (CGN), which has a 20% stake in the Sizewell C project due to be built by France’s EDF, can be removed from the equation. An announcement could come as early as this month, with taxpayers’ cash used instead. CGN was due to step up its involvement in British nuclear post-Sizewell, through a majority position in Bradwell B in Essex, intended to be a showcase for the Chinese-designed Hualong One (HPR1000) reactor. If China is forced out of a minority financial position in a plant built by French state-backed EDF, the prospect of a Chinese-controlled facility a mere 40 miles from London is surely a non-starter. Bradwell would have been a major coup, demonstrating to the world that a major economy such as the UK was open to Beijing’s proprietary nuclear technology. Duncan Smith thinks the UK’s decision could scupper the plan. “If we do this, other countries will follow suit and it will turn out to be a very big decision indicating direction of travel with China. It’s a big strategic decision.” He also has price on his side. It costs around twice as much to produce a kilowatt hour of nuclear power compared with offshore wind and solar power. But have the anti-China hawks started celebrating too soon? One industry source, who has been observing China’s nuclear ambitions for years, sees no reason to believe that CGN will bow to pressure to withdraw. Forcing China out would create a diplomatic row. “There has been a sustained effort […] to make the atmosphere so hostile that the company will just give up and go away,” the source said. “That seems a really heroic assumption.” CGN is deeply involved in the 3.2GW Hinkley project, which could yet run beyond its current £23bn budget and its 2027 completion date. “Of course it [continued Chinese investment in Hinkley] could be at risk,” said the source. “CGN is making a big contribution [to the plant] but it’s not the big flagship ‘welcome to the world’ thing that building an HPR1000 would be.” Pressure on the UK government from its own MPs, but also from abroad, seems to be behind the decision to keep China at arm’s length. Opposition from the likes of Duncan Smith and Tugendhat is one thing but American intervention is quite another. The former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo last year urged Britain to look across the Atlantic for its nuclear future, saying the US “stands ready to assist our friends in the UK with any needs they have”. The Trump administration was vocally opposed to Chinese technology incursions into the west and the Biden administration is no different. But jilting China to please America leaves Britain facing a problem. The UK nuclear fleet has a capacity of 8.9GW, about a sixth of peak demand in winter and 20% of our average needs annually. More than 7GW of that capacity – seven out of the eight existing power stations – is due to for retirement between now and 2030. Hinkley is the only project with a completion date in sight, with one reactor firing up in 2026 and the next in 2027 but it is an optimistic assumption that no delays will occur. Even if Hinkley proceeds as planned, UK nuclear capacity will still fall to 4.4GW by 2030 if nothing else is done. The upcoming Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow has reminded everyone of the UK’s commitment to decarbonise the economy entirely by 2050, while the gas price crisis has underscored the risks of relying solely on fossil fuels and renewable energy. Big nuclear power plants and their spinning turbines provide the vital inertia that is required to balance the grid and keep its frequency stable. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is keen to emphasise that nuclear is part of the solution but something needs to happen to speed up these multibillion-pound projects. At Sizewell, the government’s great hope is regulated asset base (RAB) financing, an investment structure that offers potential investors safe returns but requires legislation. A government spokesperson described it as a “credible model”, indicating moves are afoot to pursue that as a means of funding Sizewell – not to mention projects such as Wylfa, on Anglesey, which Japan’s Hitachi recently walked away from, citing funding concerns. The new financing model, used in water and power networks, could lure in American investors such as the construction giant Bechtel. If Beijing and London can find a diplomatic solution to remove CGN from UK nuclear, this funding model is a solution that could attract backers to replace the Chinese. If nuclear has a major role to play in Britain’s decarbonised future, time is of the essence. Nuclear options The UK has struggled to get nuclear projects moving in the past decade but it does have options. The first is to find investors for major new-build projects. While investors in Sizewell C are already lined up, China’s involvement is in doubt after signals that ministers are preparing to buy out its share of Bradwell B in Essex. Offering more attractive funding options could be the key to kickstarting the £20bn Wylfa project on Anglesey after Hitachi walked away last year. But the UK’s National Infrastructure Commission is cool on large-scale nuclear new projects. Advanced modular reactors (AMR), which use new coolants instead of water, are seen as a potential technological leap forward. Earlier this year, the government published a call for evidence about launching a programme to demonstrate their viability. However, even this pilot stage won’t be ready until the 2030s. There is plenty of excitement about Rolls-Royce’s plans for small modular reactors (SMRs), dubbed mini-nukes that could, in theory, be rolled out quickly and easily to boost capacity. The British engineering giant thinks it could plug them into the grid by 2030. Then there is the tantalising moonshot prospect of cracking nuclear fusion, harnessing the power of the stars to create, in theory, limitless energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/mar/10/glasgow-climate-conference-uk-green-tech-revolution-cop26","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-10T07:30:26Z","webTitle":"At the Glasgow climate conference, the UK could kickstart a green tech revolution | Mike Mason","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/10/glasgow-climate-conference-uk-green-tech-revolution-cop26","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/10/glasgow-climate-conference-uk-green-tech-revolution-cop26","fields":{"headline":"At the Glasgow climate conference, the UK could kickstart a green tech revolution","bodyText":"Einstein probably didn’t say “insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result”, but might have done had he kept tabs on the impact of the annual climate negotiations. We have now had 25 of them – the 26th Conference of the Parties (Cop26) will take place in Glasgow in November – yet greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise inexorably. Cops – especially the one in Paris in 2015 – have changed attitudes and influenced policy. But to meet the goal of reducing global emissions to net zero by mid-century we have to start doing something substantial and different in addition to seeking stronger commitments at Cop26. The good news is that there are now real grounds for optimism that we can slow and ultimately stop greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy currently outcompetes fossil fuels in many areas and continues to become cheaper every year. New energy storage options, ranging from cheaper batteries to green ammonia, are emerging. New ways to produce proteins at scale without destroying rainforests are being developed. When these solutions become so good, and so cheap, that they routinely outcompete their fossil fuel and biodiversity-destroying counterparts, greenhouse gas emissions will decline to near zero. Getting there, though, needs some serious focus on green technologies supported by policies that will get them rolled out. A research group in Oxford, led by my co-authors and myself has been identifying groups of “unicorn” technologies, named by analogy with “unicorn” startups valued at over $1bn, that can each deliver a reduction of at least a billion tonnes of CO2 a year. Unicorns don’t depend on fundamental new discoveries so should be ready for large-scale deployment within a decade. With a moderate investment in research and development or other support, they could in combination unlock multiple benefits across whole “energy ecosystems”. One example of such an ecosystem centres on converting cheap renewable energy – either from sunny places with few people, or spare wind from the North Sea – into hydrogen and ammonia, to provide zero-carbon fuel for shipping, heavy goods vehicles and even potentially aviation. They could provide the energy storage needed to complement variable wind and solar energy, process heat for industry, and turn iron ore into steel. The technologies that would unlock this ecosystem are the next generation of high-efficiency solar cells, low-cost electrolysers, and hydrogen and ammonia fuel cells and engines. All are proven technologies that simply need to be cheaper – further development could rapidly unlock a virtuous circle of falling costs and increased deployment. Another example is exceptionally water-efficient plants that can grow in semi-arid areas or on degraded land – prickly pear, pineapples and euphorbias are examples. Such plants could sequester carbon in soil on a large scale, and be fermented to proteins in place of soya beans, whose growth causes widespread deforestation and huge greenhouse gas emissions; they could even be used to make plastics. The unicorn technologies in this case include learning how to grow plants that we have historically ignored, along with precision separation and fermentation of the biomass. Getting a bold, unanimous agreement to ratchet up global ambition to act on climate at Cop26 will be very hard at this stage of the game, with the usual cabal of petro-states and coal producers doing their utmost to dilute any decisions of consequence. However, an approach focused around “coalitions of the willing” in the bottom-up spirit of the Paris climate agreement, could enable substantial progress without being stymied by vested interests. Each of these coalitions, built from nation states but also regions and even corporates, could focus on one or more of the unicorns. They would support research and development, advance demonstrators, or provide lower-cost finance or performance guarantees to encourage rollout and help the technologies become cheaper. They would allow least-developed and developed nations to share ambitions and interests in technologies where they have comparative advantages, such as solar resources, land or skills. Management and licensing of intellectual property could encourage coalitions to form and accelerate technology deployment. The formation of these coalitions could be seen as evolution of an earlier UK initiative called Mission Innovation. It targeted sectors or problems, rather than – as we are proposing – selected technology areas that underwrite whole energy ecosystems, which we believe would be a very much more productive approach. This should not be seen as “picking winners”, but rather as “picking runners”. Funders should be prepared to see failures as well as successes. As co-chair with Italy of Cop26, the UK has an excellent opportunity to build coalitions that would lead to cheaper alternatives to fossil fuels. The UK is home to several companies and world experts in both the “hydrammonia” economy and semi-arid plants, and British businesses could be leading players in these two examples of ecosystems. In parallel with preparing for Cop26, the government should also change the UK’s broad approach. Neither academia nor industry on their own has the principal objective of solving the climate crisis. They have neither skills nor funding to develop technologies that are (nearly) out of the laboratory, build demonstrators when necessary, and create the technical and financial conditions needed to enable large-scale rollout. We believe the UK needs something like the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, created in the US, which “advances high-potential, high-impact energy technologies that are too early for private-sector investment”. By fostering coalitions of the willing, which would focus on clusters of unicorn technologies, the UK could make a major contribution to solving the climate crisis. Cop26 could indeed be a turning point – but it cannot simply be more of the same. • Mike Mason is a fellow at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford.

It certainly alarmed McKibben: in June 1988, the scientist James Hansen testified to the US Congress that the world was warming rapidly and human behaviour was the primary cause – the first loud and unequivocal warning of the climate crisis to come – and before the next year was out, McKibben had published The End of Nature, the first book about climate change for a lay audience. But few others seemed particularly worried. “People think about ‘global warming’ in the way they think about ‘violence on television’ or ‘growing trade deficits’, as a marginal concern to them, if a concern at all,” he wrote in 2003. “Hardly anyone has fear in their guts.” McKibben’s words appeared in the literary magazine Granta, which I then edited, in a piece I’d commissioned for an issue on global warming: This Overheating World. It seemed a timely and important theme, but sometimes editors can get too far ahead of the game. Many thousands of people across the world felt more and knew more about the climate crisis than I did, but few of them, unfortunately, appeared to be literary novelists or writers of narrative non-fiction. The issue included some fine pieces but was not a total success. In fact, Margaret Atwood did publish a novel that year, Oryx and Crake, set in a world ruined by climate breakdown (among other causes), but the most prominent examples of its fictional treatment, the small genre sometimes known as “cli-fi”, had still to come. Cormac McCarthy’s The Road, published in 2006, may never be surpassed, not even by the Book of Revelation, as the future’s most terrifying herald. Literature had good reasons to resist. I’m never sure what the German philosopher-sociologist Theodor Adorno was driving at with his statement that “to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric”; only that he might be suggesting that in the prospect or memory of such a calamity, poetry was useless and the pretension of its relevance simple-minded. And so it might be with novels and the climate crisis. Earlier writers such as Jules Verne and HG Wells entertained their readers with versions of the future that were sometimes frightening, but only in a hide-beneath-the-bedsheets way, and against the common grain of western optimism that the future would be better than the past (a feeling that survived the Eurocentric horror of the last century’s first 50 years, and, in my generation’s case, the Cuban missile crisis and the threat of nuclear war). Who believes it now? The idea of a better future has been replaced by one of a future not as bad as it could be, providing urgent steps are taken; but for more than 20 years (more than 30 years, if the counting starts with Hansen’s address to Congress) the science behind our understanding of climate breakdown was widely dismissed either as an international conspiracy or an inconvenient speculation, or relegated to a problem on a par with McKibben’s “growing trade deficits”. National electorates and their political leaders; media magnates; company stockholders and executives, especially those in the carbon fuel business: few of them wanted to know. As recently as 2015, Boris Johnson could describe worldwide concern over the climate as “global leaders driven by a primitive fear that the present ambient warm weather is somehow caused by humanity”. In 2012 Anne-Marie Trevelyan, now his international trade secretary, wrote in support of a campaign against windfarms: “We aren’t getting hotter, global warming isn’t actually happening.” As the gospel of St Luke tells us, there will be more joy in heaven over a single sinner who repents than over the 99 righteous people who don’t need to bother, but here on Earth it might be appropriate to have statements such as Trevelyan’s (she made several) incised on durable measuring sticks that can be inserted along the high tidemark of her Northumberland constituency, whose coastline is so long and low. It would be wrong, however, to confine the blame for our delayed engagement to straightforward denialism. Recognising climate breakdown as a possibly terminal crisis for civilisation led to the difficulty of managing it inside our heads. As David Runciman, professor of politics at Cambridge University, wrote six years ago: “It’s hard to come up with a good analogy for climate change but that doesn’t stop people from trying. We seem to want some way of framing the problem that makes a decent outcome look less unlikely than it often appears.” He listed the most common analogies: climate was a “moonshot problem”, a “war mobilisation problem”, a “disease eradication problem”. Beyond giving a notion of the effort required, none worked; war, for instance, needed a clear enemy in view – and in the climate crisis, Runciman wrote, “the enemy is us”. Analogies offered a false comfort: “Just because we did all those things doesn’t mean we can do this one.” Climate breakdown is like nothing that has gone before. Like an intermittent fountain, its ghastly prospect shoots high in the air one minute and then vanishes as though it had never been. On 9 August this year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a report that spread alarm and despondency everywhere. “A code red for humanity,” warned the UN secretary general. “The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable: greenhouse gas emissions … are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk.” By 11 August, A-level results, Brexit lorry queues and Prince Andrew had squeezed the message from every front page. An ordinary kind of life goes on. Research shows that in 2020 the word “cake” was mentioned 10 times more often on UK television shows than the phrase “climate change’”, and that “banana bread” was heard more frequently than “wind power” and “solar power” combined. Research shows that four in 10 young people around the world are hesitant to have children, while three-quarters of them find the future frightening and more than half believe humanity is doomed. Research (by the climate scientists James Dyke, Robert Watson and Wolfgang Knorr) shows that if humanity had acted on Hansen’s testimony immediately to stop the accelerating use of fossil fuels and begun a decarbonisation process of around 2% a year, then we would now have a two-in-three chance of limiting warming to 1.5C. If that calculation is correct, the odds these days must be quite a lot longer. Is there fear in our guts? Boris Johnson spoke to the UN assembly on Wednesday like a boy who wanted the applause of the Oxford Union. He had a clever reference (Sophocles), a popular reference (The Muppet Show), and a reference to a particular kind of English life (“unlocking the drinks cabinet”) that vanished with the Austin Allegro. It seems unlikely that the world can be saved by such a speech, but there is no point complaining. For this dangerous moment, he is what we have.

It takes a lot of energy for one man to make a sprawling office emptied by Covid-19 feel alive, but the Irishman has more than enough for the job. It is less than a year since the oil corporation BP, the venture’s joint-owner, thrust it into the spotlight by unveiling plans to grow its renewable energy generation 20-fold within this decade. Now Boyle is poised to set out how Lightsource will help power one of the biggest corporate transformations ever attempted. “We knew that the interest in solar and renewables was going to rise. But not even in my wildest dreams would I have assumed that it was going to rise at the pace that it has,” Boyle says. The former financial services executive founded the company, then known as Lightsource Renewable Energy, at the end of 2010 with five employees and a solar farm in Truro, Cornwall, capable of generating enough electricity to power 430 homes. Within seven years Boyle had grown the company to a team of 300, with solar farms in Ireland, Netherlands, India and the US – catching the eye of major players hoping to buy into the solar boom. It was at the end of 2017 that the oil giant’s acquisition of 43% of the company, now rebranded as Lightsource BP, was agreed. Two years later that stake was increased to create the 50:50 joint venture in place today. “The word ‘symbiosis’ seems to be used to describe the relationship we have with BP, and I think that’s a very fair description’,” Boyle says. It was a deal that helped make Lightsource one of the fastest growing solar companies in the world, and provided BP with the clean-energy testbed it needed to propose one of the greatest transformation plans in corporate history. The venture has tripled its global reach to 15 countries, and doubled its workforce from 300 in 2017 to around 600 staff across its global portfolio today. Lightsource BP’s initial goal was to use the oil giant’s financial muscle to grow a 1.6 gigawatt pipeline of solar projects to a portfolio of 10GW of solar investments by 2023. “We didn’t sit back and plan to deliver 10GW; we realised at some point the question would be asked: ‘Have you got the capability to do more?’” Boyle says. Since then BP has brought in a new CEO, Bernard Looney, and discovered a renewed appetite for renewable energy. The new target is now for Lightsource BP to more than double its planned solar rollout, to 25GW by 2025. “One of things that we’ve done really well in the first years in partnership with BP is that we’ve set aggressive targets and we’ve delivered on every one them … They were able to believe us when we said: ‘Guys, 10GW isn’t really pushing the envelope.’ That was the start of the conversation about how we redefine what ‘good’ looks like,” Boyle says. Solar energy is expected to play a crucial role in helping BP meet its 2030 renewable energy target because solar farms can be rolled out far quicker than its plans to build offshore wind farms by the second half of the decade. As well as Lightsource’s facilities, BP also plans to finance its own solar farms which the solar venture will develop and run as a “gun for hire”. “We already have momentum,” Boyle says. “The fact that we are able to deliver with confidence allows BP to believe that their early 2025 [interim target] is actually doable predominantly through solar, and that’s important to them.” This confidence is also important to BP’s shareholders, many of whom remain sceptical that the financial returns from renewable energy can compete with the cash generated from barrels of crude. “This is always an amusing one for me,” Boyle says. “People who compare the returns on solar with oil and gas miss the fact that they’re comparing an apple to a fish.” Boyle was drawn to the solar industry from a background in retail financial services, “selling a little bit to a lot of people”, because he recognised solar power’s long-term predictable returns as the “Holy Grail of small volume investments”. “We know that the sun will come up and the sun will go down so we’re essentially creating an annuity of very predictable generation multiplied by a fixed price that has already been agreed with some of the largest companies in the world.” Lightsource BP earlier this month struck a deal to build the largest solar farm in the US state of Louisiana to supply clean energy to McDonald’s and eBay. It has also agreed a deal to supply electricity to Amazon from an existing solar farm in Ohio, and to supply power to BP service stations from solar farms in New South Wales, Australia. “That’s a very different bet to digging a hole and wondering whether you’ll hit gas or oil, and how much, and what it’ll cost to get it out, and what the market price will be when you get it out,” he says. By the same analogy investing in solar would be “like digging a hole and knowing how much oil is there, how much it will cost and how much you’ll be paid for it before you start”, Boyle says. The solar industry is not without its challenges. Earlier this year reports emerged that some of China’s biggest solar companies may have ties to Uyghur forced-labour camps in Xinjiang via polysilicon production. Ongoing US sanctions against China’s solar supply chain threaten to raise costs, and slow the pace of the industry globally. Lightsource BP was one of the companies that sourced their panels and components from the companies linked to Xinjiang, albeit prior to 2016 when the state-sanctioned abuse of Uyghur communities began to gain international attention. Boyle says the company is ready to meet these challenges “head on”. Lightsource has not used Chinese-made solar panels “for years now” due to the US sanctions, and is working with industry groups across its geographical portfolio to help improve the “traceability” of the solar supply chain. “At the end of the day there shouldn’t be a trade-off between the advantages of renewables and the disadvantages of individuals being put through hardship,” he says. There’s no slowing down solar, he says. In the future, demand for solar electricity will be fuelled by two things: the boom in low-cost batteries that mean solar can be used at any time, and the desire to produce green hydrogen – made from renewable electricity and water – which will mean solar will effectively be used anywhere from sea to train to plane. “Hydrogen could be shipped around the world as an energy source which essentially came from the sun but is captured as a gas, and burned the same way as historic hydrocarbons,” Boyle says. “The future in hydrogen alone makes the 25GW target look small. The potential for solar is absolutely huge.” The potential for Lightsource BP appears to be just as bright."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2020/oct/13/lady-verma-tory-peer-apologises-for-ministerial-rule-breach-in-uganda-deals","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2020-10-13T16:28:58Z","webTitle":"Tory peer apologises for ministerial rule breach in Uganda deals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/13/lady-verma-tory-peer-apologises-for-ministerial-rule-breach-in-uganda-deals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2020/oct/13/lady-verma-tory-peer-apologises-for-ministerial-rule-breach-in-uganda-deals","fields":{"headline":"Tory peer apologises for ministerial rule breach in Uganda deals","bodyText":"A former minister who denied breaching the ministerial code after her family firm signed multimillion pound deals with Uganda’s government has apologised for breaking the rules to a parliamentary watchdog, it has emerged. Lady Verma, the former energy minister, told the Guardian last month she did not have to inform the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba) after Nexus Green Ltd signed solar deals worth more than £88m with the sub-Saharan country. Letters released on Tuesday by the committee show she has been rebuked for a breach of ministerial rules by failing to seek advice about her role as a director in the firm. The former mayoral candidate has written to the committee to offer her “sincere apologies” for not understanding the rules and for failing to seek advice. Verma was a junior minister in the Department of Energy and Climate Change from 2012 to 2015, and then the Department for International Development (DfID) from May 2015 to July 2016. Seven months after leaving the government, she was present when Nexus Green signed an £8m deal with Uganda’s notoriously homophobic president, Yoweri Museveni, to provide the military with solar power. Verma has attended several meetings with Museveni and became a director of Nexus Green in March 2018. The firm signed another deal with the Ugandan government last year, this time worth £80m, to build a factory to make solar equipment. Most of this deal is supposed to be financed with a loan from UK Export Finance, a government department. The deals have surprised other suppliers in the African solar power market. Verma and her son Rikki are the firm’s only directors and have no previous experience in the industry. According to rules to ensure transparency, ministers are supposed to declare all roles and jobs for up to two years after leaving office. When approached by the Guardian last month, Verma said she did not break the rules because Nexus Green was an energy firm and not connected to her last government role in DfID. “I did not have to declare this because I had left energy many years earlier,” she said. Lord Pickles, the chair of Acoba, wrote to Verma on 17 September, saying he was “concerned to see commentary in the media suggesting you did not need to seek Acoba’s advice” and disclosed that she had separately contacted the committee to apologise. “Failure to seek advice is a clear breach of the requirement set out in the ministerial code and the government’s appointment rules,” he wrote. In reply, Verma said she had broken the rules but insisted that her role is unpaid, advisory and has no executive powers. “My son, who is the CEO, asked me to join in an advisory capacity only because of my many years of business experience. “I am truly sorry for my misunderstanding of the rules which I accept is my failing and sincerely hope that the committee will accept my deepest regret at this failure. I would not deliberately disrespect the rules and sincerely apologise to the committee,” she wrote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2021/sep/14/hurry-up-and-wait-the-joys-of-slow-culture","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-14T08:00:08Z","webTitle":"Hurry up and wait: the joys of slow culture ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/sep/14/hurry-up-and-wait-the-joys-of-slow-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2021/sep/14/hurry-up-and-wait-the-joys-of-slow-culture","fields":{"headline":"Hurry up and wait: the joys of slow culture ","bodyText":"If one thing guarantees a TV hit in 2021, it’s a lukewarm reception. Take Ted Lasso, a sitcom about a perky, naive American football coach transplanted on to British soil. Its first season premiered last summer to barely any fanfare – but little by little came mass critical reconsideration. The show ended up a smash hit, breaking the record for most Emmy nominations for a first season of a comedy. Its second series, concluding next month, has made it one of the most talked-about shows of the year. Then there is The Morning Show, which stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon as breakfast news anchors and returns to Apple TV+ for season two this month. Despite debuting in 2019 to a tepid response, by the end of its first run reviewers were harmonising about a change of heart. Even Succession, back soon for a wildly anticipated third series, was greeted with some ambivalence at first, something its creator Jesse Armstrong took in his stride – even hinting it was an intentional feature when he recently described it as “a prickly pear of a show”. The sleeper hit has always existed but its contemporary pervasiveness is startling. The lightning-fast nature of social media seems primed for the quickly metabolised, soon-forgotten craze; the instantaneous access occasioned by streaming suggests a world with no time to foster slow-burn success. Yet we have become strangely accommodating to the pop-cultural grower. Partly, we have the pandemic to thank. While there were flash-in-the-pan sensations during lockdown (notably Tiger King), the fact that film and television production stalled meant demand outstripped supply. The internet was suddenly laden with recommendations for underrated streaming delights. It gave people a chance to catch their breath: with more time than usual on their hands, and freed temporarily from the constant stream of brand new “must-see”, viewers could discover things on their own terms. There were unpredictable developments. Lad: A Yorkshire Story, an unsung low-budget film from 2011, became a lockdown hit, amassing nearly 2m views. The video game Among Us, a space-themed multiplayer in which certain users secretly sabotage the team, garnered little attention in 2018 but erupted in popularity last year. Its guessing game conceit offered an escape from the stress of the pandemic and let players socialise with friends during lockdown. One of the biggest Covid TV successes was Schitt’s Creek, a comfort watch that, coincidentally, mined comedy from a family’s uncomfortable confinement. The show saw a serious uptick in popularity as the first lockdown set in – although its slow-burn trajectory pre-dates the pandemic. The Canadian sitcom, created by and starring father-and-son duo Dan and Eugene Levy, originally aired in the US on an obscure channel called Pop TV. It only reached wider attention after its third season was picked up by Netflix – a phenomenon known as “the Netflix bump” (previous recipients include Breaking Bad). Last year, the show swept the Emmys, winning all seven major comedy awards. It was a similar slow-burn success story for the Cotswolds-set mockumentary This Country – a show about being cut off from wider society in a supposed rural idyll – which met with virtual silence in 2017. By the time its third series concluded in early 2020, it was a ratings triumph, attracting a staggering 52m iPlayer requests. Streaming has reconfigured the pop culture timeline. Previously, a sleeper hit would develop linearly (Nirvana’s 1991 album Nevermind spent four months climbing the charts), often directed by cultural gatekeepers, such as TV channels repeating certain programmes (The Office gained traction following a sleepy summer debut in 2001). On-demand streaming has derailed those trajectories: something can flop at first, never get another chance from the powers that be, and still find its crowd years later. Songs, especially, have a longer window for potential success than they once did. Sleeper superstar Lizzo rose from indie concern to the mainstream in 2019, coinciding with the release of her third album, Cuz I Love You. Yet it was two older tracks – Good As Hell (2016) and Truth Hurts (2017) – that cemented her position as the year’s breakout icon. The latter gained massive traction after going viral on TikTok and appearing on the soundtrack to Netflix film Someone Great; the former was simply rediscovered by new converts. Novelty still drives the web to a degree – but that novelty may come from the past. TikTok has a determinedly untimely approach to pop culture, resurrecting songs both ancient and merely dated. It might tap into shared nostalgia (the renewed interest in Natasha Bedingfield’s 2004 single Unwritten) or grant an audience to a song that never had one: last year, obscure Orlando indie duo Sales had two songs – 2013’s Renee and 2014’s Chinese New Year – go viral, the former soundtracking 1.2m TikTok clips to date. While there is often a random aspect to these breakthroughs, it increasingly feels as if pop culture is being designed for the slow burn. Recently named the UK’s most-watched drama of the century, Line of Duty was always brilliant, but such a feat would have been impossible to predict by the end of the deliberately knotty, modestly viewed first series in 2012. It became a word-of-mouth hit, with streaming apparently hardwired into its success: this year’s sixth series repeatedly referenced clues, characters and plots from the first, necessitating a mass rewatch. It might be a mirage, but in retrospect it seems as though Line of Duty was always engineered for the long haul. Similarly, two of the year’s most-anticipated albums look like being growers. Lorde’s Solar Power is a mellow, unshowy record that slowly ingratiates itself; Billie Eilish’s Happier Than Ever is cut from a similar, if more subdued, cloth – perhaps because, in both cases, precocious superstardom has left their makers less interested in courting celebrity and more intent on securing longevity and sustainability. The series of this summer, meanwhile, was Mike White’s HBO drama The White Lotus, which for all the slightly hysterical hype turned out to be a nifty exercise in slow-burn appeal. Hooking the viewer in with a mysterious killing, it proceeded to offer a sun-baked meditation on privilege and identity politics that was subtle and simmering. The internet made culture limitless and the mainstream is more fractured than ever. It creates the impression of an infinite pop-culture stream, all of it eminently disposable. The slow burn cuts through this malaise: there is a sense that despite the overwhelming onslaught of material, quality will eventually triumph. In fact, it may be even more likely to. In the past, pop’s objective was to shift CDs on the week of release, TV aimed to attract viewers during broadcast and most films only had a limited time to make their box-office mark. The point was to get people to pay for these things once. Nowadays, repeat streams – or consolidated viewing figures – are the key to success in all mediums. Could the internet, counter to most logic, actually be making pop culture less transient? We’ll just have to wait and see."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2021/may/31/eus-greenhouse-gas-emissions-fell-in-2019-data-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-31T17:11:15Z","webTitle":"EU’s greenhouse gas emissions fell by nearly 4% in 2019, data shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/31/eus-greenhouse-gas-emissions-fell-in-2019-data-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/may/31/eus-greenhouse-gas-emissions-fell-in-2019-data-shows","fields":{"headline":"EU’s greenhouse gas emissions fell by nearly 4% in 2019, data shows","bodyText":"The EU’s greenhouse gas emissions fell by nearly 4% in 2019, data from Europe’s environmental watchdog has shown, as countries met online for the first time in UN climate negotiations. The fall of 3.8% for EU member states in 2019 brought EU emissions to 24% below 1990 levels – or 26% if carbon sinks are taken into account – according to the European Environment Agency. The EU’s target is for a 55% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 1990 levels and including carbon sinks, so if similar cuts can be continued for the next decade then the bloc is likely to meet its goals. The UK has its own targets, of a 68% reduction in emissions by 2030 and a 78% cut by 2035. The EEA said about 80% of the EU’s reduction in emissions in 2019 was from the heat and power sector. But the EU’s emissions from transport have continued to rise, meaning new policies and investment are likely to be needed to meet the bloc’s future emissions targets. Campaigners have said the EU’s CO2 goals are not stretching enough, though member states argue they are tougher than most other countries. Lorelei Limousin, a climate and transport campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “Europe must rapidly phase out fossil fuels and produce vastly more of its energy from renewable sources like wind and solar power. But Europe also has to consume much less energy overall, including in the transport sector where emissions are actually increasing. “The EU needs to transform transport. Internal combustion engines, aviation subsidies and short-haul flights should all be phased out. Europe needs a shift from air and road travel to rail wherever possible, and to increase access to public transport for all.” The confirmation of the EU’s emissions fall came as nations embarked on three weeks of online UN climate negotiations, to prepare for the crunch Cop26 climate talks later this year. Cop26 will be held in Glasgow this November, postponed from last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In normal years, the UN convenes two weeks of preparatory talks at its climate headquarters in Bonn, about six months before each climate Cop (conference of the parties). This year, Covid-related travel restrictions mean the talks are taking place online for the first time, and have been expanded to three weeks. There have been months of discussion over whether and how some of the negotiations necessary for a successful Cop26 can take place online. Developing countries are particularly concerned, as many have limited communications and staff capacity to undertake complex negotiations virtually. They are also keen that their agreement to conduct some negotiations online should not be taken as a sign that Cop26 itself can take place virtually, as many are adamant that the talks must take place in person. The UK, as host nation, has sought to reassure developing countries on this score, pledging to explore vaccinations and testing to ensure the talks can take place in person. The preparatory talks will not have full formal status, as any decisions made will have to be formally confirmed at a later date. Patricia Espinosa, the UN’s top climate official, said the preparatory talks were vital to sort out some of the remaining sticking points in the “Paris rulebook”, a set of technical agreements necessary to bring the 2015 Paris accord into full operation. One of these sticking points, known as article 6, concerns the workings of CO2 markets, and a failure to agree on it disrupted the last UN climate talks, held in Madrid in 2019. Espinosa said: “It’s time to wrap up outstanding negotiations and implement the Paris agreement. Time is running out for the world to achieve the goals of the Paris agreement. Unleashing its full potential will not only address climate change but help the world build forward from Covid-19 and drive the transformation towards a cleaner, greener and more sustainable future.” Although no breakthrough is expected in the three weeks of preparatory talks, observers will be watching keenly for signs of progress, or of discord among nations that could presage a difficult passage to Cop26 in November. If the talks go well, nations can move on from some of the more bureaucratic aspects to talks of greater substance. Most major countries have now signed up to a long-term target of reaching net zero emissions around mid-century. More important, however, are plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions this decade, in line with scientific advice that found global carbon must be halved by 2030 to keep the world within a 1.5C (2.7F) rise in temperatures, above pre-industrial levels. These plans, called nationally determined contributions (NDCs), are the bedrock of the Paris accord, but current NDCs are still inadequate to meet the Paris goals. Developed countries must also come up with billions more in financial assistance to the poor world, to help poor countries cut greenhouse gases and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown, if Cop26 is to be a success."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/dec/19/windfarms-in-great-britain-break-record-for-clear-power-generation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-19T15:35:44Z","webTitle":"Windfarms in Great Britain break record for clean power generation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/19/windfarms-in-great-britain-break-record-for-clear-power-generation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/dec/19/windfarms-in-great-britain-break-record-for-clear-power-generation","fields":{"headline":"Windfarms in Great Britain break record for clean power generation","bodyText":"Blustery winter weather helped Great Britain’s windfarms set a record for clean power generation, which made up more than 40% of its electricity on Friday. Wind turbines generated 17.3GW on Friday afternoon, according to figures from the electricity system operator, narrowly beating the previous record set in early January this year. High wind speeds across the country helped wind power’s share of the electricity mix remain above 40% through Saturday. Coal and gas plants made up less than a fifth of electricity generated. Melanie Onn, the deputy chief executive of Renewable UK, said: “It’s great to see our onshore and offshore windfarms have smashed another record, generating more power on a cold December day than ever before, just when we need it most.” The record follows the “greenest” year ever for the electricity system thanks to a surge in renewable energy and sharp drop in energy demand caused by the shutdown of office blocks, restaurants and schools during coronavirus restrictions. Solar power reached a record of 9.6GW in April, which helped spur the longest coal-free streak ever, of 1,629 consecutive hours, which ended in June. Wind power generation reached a record share of almost 60% of electricity use in August as demand for power fell by more than a fifth compared with the year before. The abundance of clean electricity caused the carbon intensity of the electricity grid in March fell to an all-time monthly low of 143g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour, and annual figures are expected to confirm that 2020 was the greenest year. “We expect to see many more records set in the years ahead, as the government has made wind energy one of the most important pillars of its energy strategy for reaching net zero emissions as fast and as cheaply as possible,” said Onn. “This new record is an early Christmas present we can all celebrate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/oct/21/renewable-energy-to-expand-by-50-in-next-five-years-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-21T05:00:23Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy to expand by 50% in next five years - report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/21/renewable-energy-to-expand-by-50-in-next-five-years-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/oct/21/renewable-energy-to-expand-by-50-in-next-five-years-report","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy to expand by 50% in next five years - report","bodyText":"Global supplies of renewable electricity are growing faster than expected and could expand by 50% in the next five years, powered by a resurgence in solar energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) found that solar, wind and hydropower projects are rolling out at their fastest rate in four years. Its latest report predicts that by 2024 a new dawn for cheap solar power could see the world’s solar capacity grow by 600GW, almost double the installed total electricity capacity of Japan. Overall, renewable electricity is expected to grow by 1,200GW in the next five years, the equivalent of the total electricity capacity of the US. “This is a pivotal time for renewable energy,” said the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol. “Technologies such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind are at the heart of transformations taking place across the global energy system. Their increasing deployment is crucial for efforts to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, reduce air pollution, and expand energy access.” The Guardian reported earlier this month that a renewable energy revolution could end the world’s rising demand for oil and coal in the 2020s, decades ahead of forecasts from oil and mining companies. Renewable energy sources make up 26% of the world’s electricity today, but according to the IEA its share is expected to reach 30% by 2024. The resurgence follows a global slowdown last year, due to falling technology costs and rising environmental concerns. However, Birol warned that the role of renewables in the global energy system would need to grow even faster if the world hopes to meet its climate targets. The report said growing climate ambitions in the European Union and the US played the biggest role in driving the IEA’s forecasts higher, but it will be China which leads the way in rolling out wind and solar energy projects. The IEA expects solar energy to play the biggest role in jumpstarting fresh growth in global renewable energy because falling costs are already below retail electricity prices in most countries. The cost of solar power is expected to decline by a further 15% to 35% by 2024, spurring further growth over the second half of the decade. The appetite of energy-hungry businesses and factories is expected to be the biggest driver of the solar power boom as company bosses exploit falling costs to help cut their energy bills. But the number of home solar panels is also expected to more than double to reach around 100m rooftops by 2024, with the strongest per capita growth in Australia, Belgium, California, the Netherlands and Austria. Even after the “spectacular” growth expected for solar over the next five years, panels will cover only 6% of the world’s available rooftops, leaving room for further growth. “Renewables are already the world’s second largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,” Birol said. He warned that although the potential for solar power was “breathtaking” the rapid rollout could disrupt electricity markets unless regulators and utilities adapt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2021/feb/08/apprentices-bring-a-fresh-perspective-to-the-uks-renewables-industry-we-need-that","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2021-02-08T21:00:53Z","webTitle":"Apprentices bring a fresh perspective to the UK's renewables industry – we need that","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/feb/08/apprentices-bring-a-fresh-perspective-to-the-uks-renewables-industry-we-need-that","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2021/feb/08/apprentices-bring-a-fresh-perspective-to-the-uks-renewables-industry-we-need-that","fields":{"headline":"Apprentices bring a fresh perspective to the UK's renewables industry – we need that","bodyText":"Deploying solar power at a commercial scale is such a young industry that we’ve always had a big intake of relatively young people. It’s tough to find employees with a 20- or 30-year-long career in this sector – there just isn’t an abundance of that sort of experience. We’re an industry that’s constantly evolving, and that means there are new and exciting career paths being created all of the time. Lightsource bp has been developing solar projects since 2010. We’ve built three-gigawatt (GW) of solar capacity across the world (enough to power around 1m homes), with about another 16GW of solar projects in various stages of development. We employ 500 people across 14 different countries and are expanding fast as demand for renewable energy grows. In the UK, we have historically taken on apprentices within the operations, maintenance and engineering side of the business. Apprenticeships last for 18 months and are typically field based, with apprentices driving from site to site, shadowing experienced engineers and learning about performing maintenance tasks across our solar farms. That practical experience complements the technical knowledge they learn in the classroom, as well as providing solar-specific training and skills. In 2021, we’re expanding that apprenticeship programme across the business, bringing young talent into teams such as business development, HR and communications. We like the diversity of thought that apprentices have. They bring a fresh perspective to the way we work. There’s also an element of reverse mentoring, as their digital skills in particular rub off on others. When apprentices in operations use mobile technology to help them on a job, for example, alongside engineers who only really ever use their phones to make calls, it can really accelerate the evolution of skills among the whole workforce and identify new opportunities for improved efficiencies. We’re open to a wide range of educational backgrounds when recruiting candidates, but definitely look for an interest in sustainability. We don’t have to look very hard for it – the younger generations are much more used to thinking and talking about renewables as a key priority for the future. We want our apprentices to have an entrepreneurial spirit, and be agile thinkers who can adapt fast to changing technology. These are also our future customers and the fact that we can access their insights is of incredible value to us as an organisation. The future of renewable energy really lies in the hands of today’s apprentices. As employers, we have an amazing opportunity to nurture this next generation of motivated, sustainability-minded leaders who will meet the world’s growing demand for renewable technology. They are likely to move across verticals – whether wind, solar or hydrogen – and being open-minded about collaboration across the sector will only help us to achieve the goals we’re all working towards. Apprenticeships are an investment in an individual’s future, but they’re also an investment in the renewable sector’s future. Heather Hayes is the global HR director for Lightsource bp.

Cottonwood trees bend, tall grass lies flat and 18-wheel trucks tip over along Interstate 80. It only takes a breeze of about 6mph to get the long white arms of an electricity-generating wind turbine turning, at full speed they can power thousands of homes. As one of the US’s windiest states, Wyoming has enormous potential to help power the country’s green revolution, but renewable energy in the west has long been dogged by a fundamental problem of transmission. Wind and solar farms tend to be located in remote areas separated from populated cities by hundreds of miles of rugged terrain, a tangle of government regulations and resistance from landowners who don’t want power lines buzzing over their yards. After more than a decade of trying, a corporation that made billions drilling for oil is poised to add a critical piece in the renewable energy puzzle. This month, TransWest Express LLC announced that it had acquired almost all the permits, permissions and partnerships needed to begin seeking customers for a 732-mile high voltage power line that would carry 20,000 GWh of renewable energy a year – roughly three-quarters of the energy needed to power Los Angeles – from southern Wyoming to a distribution hub near Las Vegas where it could tap into the grid that feeds Phoenix and Los Angeles. With extreme heat bearing down on desert cities, the Colorado River running so low that the Hoover dam’s energy production has dwindled by a quarter, wildfires raging from June through October and freak winter storms knocking out gas operations, western energy managers need new and diverse sources of power to avoid more blackouts. If it comes to fruition, the TransWest Express would provide crucial alternatives while helping western states meet their ambitious renewable energy commitments. The company behind TransWest, Anschutz Corporation, amassed a fortune in the 20th century in the oil-rich shale deposits of Wyoming. Today, the Denver-based corporation controls the Washington Examiner, the Los Angeles Kings hockey team and the Coachella music festival. It’s also the largest private oil and gas company in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, drilling on more than 155,800 hectares (385,000 acres). Anschutz , which has a deep rooting in fossil fuels, says it sees the potential in renewables and, specifically, the opportunity in overcoming the field’s debilitating transmission obstacle. But the path has been riddled with obstacles. “These big interregional connections across the whole grid system have not been built in decades,” said Kara Choquette, communications director for TransWest Express. The price of navigating the west’s regulatory quagmire is a significant deterrent, but TransWest is backed by a fossil-fueled empire. Anschutz also has a vested interest in connecting Wyoming wind to larger markets, because it happens to be building what would be the largest windfarm in North America on a ranch in Carbon county: the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Project, which could come online in 2026. Since 2008, TransWest has spent tens of millions of dollars to secure permissions across private and public land in 14 counties and four states, Choquette said. Historically, the sheer size of the region has limited connectivity. Whereas eastern states are generally small and tightly knitted, the American west encompasses some 1.8m sq miles. Currently, there is only about 136,000 miles of electricity transmission network, said Vijay Satyal, regional energy markets manager for Western Resource Advocates, a conservation nonprofit based in Colorado. On top of that, much of the infrastructure is ageing, and municipal utility companies have been reluctant to upgrade or join larger, more competitive interstate grids. “It is the fear of giving up, in many cases, expensive and less efficient systems,” Satyal said. “It’s like riding a clunker car down to the ground.” When it comes online around 2024, the TransWest Express will comprise two systems: a direct-current line suited to long-distance transmission between Sinclair, Wyoming and Delta, Utah, and an alternating current line linking the Utah terminal to southern Nevada and, eventually, beyond. Its support towers would reach 180 ft tall, and its 250-ft wide path would cross sagebrush, high desert and low montane forest. For that reason, the project has drawn concern from environmentalists worried its footprint would harm prime wilderness and sensitive habitat for vulnerable species like the desert tortoise and greater sage grouse. Wyoming is home to about 37% of the country’s remaining sage grouse, an iconic western bird whose populations have been reduced by housing development, oil and gas extraction and, especially recently, searing wildfires. Transmission infrastructure poses direct and indirect risks to sagebrush habitat and species like grouse, said Jeffrey Beck, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Wyoming. Some may fly into the wires, but more could die in fires fueled in part by invasive weeds that hitch a ride on work equipment or suffer predation from raptors and ravens that establish nests in overhead support structures. Generally, grouse tend to avoid tall things, and “It’s not like these animals have anywhere else to go,” said Beck. To address these concerns, TransWest proposed multiple routes that predominantly ride shotgun along existing infrastructure, like railroads and highways, and thread the needle between core habitat areas. As a result, the Bureau of Land Management and all the local natural resource departments along the way have approved the project. However, it’s not just environmentalists slowing the west’s renewable energy transition: wind power has struggled against those who see turbines as eyesores and those still deeply invested in coal. In Wyoming, the minerals industry has slowed renewable development by painting the wind and sun as unreliable and expensive, while repeatedly lobbying to raise taxes on the industry. And yet, the TransWest Express – a big green energy transmission project proposed by an oil company, that would run through areas of the west that have historically depended on resource extraction – points to a tectonic cultural shift. The cost of renewable energy is falling and investment in its development is rising. This is just one of at least 22 shovel-ready high-voltage wind and solar power transmission projects that could bump US generation by 50% and add more than 1.2m jobs, according to a report sponsored by Americans for a Clean Energy Grid. Still, “it takes time to build renewable energy projects,” Satyal said. The benefits of interstate renewable energy are clear today, but it hasn’t always been that way, and “utilities have not realized how fast that change would come”. • This article was amended on 30 July 2021.

The amount of clean energy from renewable energy developers bought by companies has tripled in the past two years, driven by a growing corporate appetite for sustainable energy. Tech giants including Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft have emerged as the biggest buyers of renewable energy to help power their data centres. BloombergNEF found that global corporations have purchased enough clean energy in the past 12 years to eclipse the entire energy capacity of countries such as Vietnam or Poland. Tech firms bought almost a quarter of the renewable energy sold to global companies last year, according to the report. The largest buyer is Google, which last year revealed plans for the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said the clean energy deal would include 18 separate agreements to supply Google with electricity from wind and solar projects across the world. The search engine’s green energy portfolio will grow by 40%, giving the company access to an extra 1.6 gigawatts of clean electricity – the equivalent capacity of a million solar rooftops, the company said. BloombergNEF found that 100 companies in 23 countries struck deals to buy 19.5GW of renewable energy last year, up 40% from the record set the year before. The so-called power purchase agreements (PPAs) are likely to have cost between $20bn and $30bn (£15bn to £23bn), making up about 10% of the world’s total renewable energy investments in 2019. The market for PPAs has grown rapidly in North America, where most such purchases are made, but a growing number of deals were struck in Europe and Latin America. Kyle Harrison, the lead author of the report, said: “The clean energy portfolios of some of the largest corporate buyers rival those of the world’s biggest utilities. These companies are facing mounting pressure from investors to decarbonise.” In 2019 alone, nearly 400 companies committed to set evidence-based climate targets, more than doubling the total number of firms with these goals. Sixty-three companies vowed to buy enough clean energy to meet 100% of their energy demand. These sustainability commitments are expected to fuel clean energy investments of almost $100bn over the next decade to build 105GW of new solar and wind power plants globally, said BNEF. Harrison said these sustainability commitments would “ensure that clean energy procurement from corporations continues to thrive” but that support from policymakers and investors would be key to meeting their growing appetite for clean energy. “The ball is in the court of utilities, policymakers and investors. They will need to meet these buyers in the middle, especially in nascent markets for corporate procurement,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/aug/20/electric-car-batteries-what-happens-to-them","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-20T12:00:34Z","webTitle":"Millions of electric car batteries will retire in the next decade.

What happens to them?","bodyText":"A tsunami of electric vehicles is expected in rich countries, as car companies and governments pledge to ramp up their numbers – there are predicted be 145m on the roads by 2030. But while electric vehicles can play an important role in reducing emissions, they also contain a potential environmental timebomb: their batteries. By one estimate, more than 12m tons of lithium-ion batteries are expected to retire between now and 2030. Not only do these batteries require large amounts of raw materials, including lithium, nickel and cobalt – mining for which has climate, environmental and human rights impacts – they also threaten to leave a mountain of electronic waste as they reach the end of their lives. As the automotive industry starts to transform, experts say now is the time to plan for what happens to batteries at the end of their lives, to reduce reliance on mining and keep materials in circulation. A second life Hundreds of millions of dollars are flowing into recycling startups and research centers to figure out how to disassemble dead batteries and extract valuable metals at scale. But if we want to do more with the materials that we have, recycling shouldn’t be the first solution, said James Pennington, who leads the World Economic Forum’s circular economy program. “The best thing to do at first is to keep things in use for longer,” he said. “There is a lot of [battery] capacity left at the end of first use in electric vehicles,” said Jessika Richter, who researches environmental policy at Lund University. These batteries may no longer be able run vehicles but they could have second lives storing excess power generated by solar or windfarms. Several companies are running trials. The energy company Enel Group is using 90 batteries retired from Nissan Leaf cars in an energy storage facility in Melilla, Spain, which is isolated from the Spanish national grid. In the UK, the energy company Powervault partnered with Renault to outfit home energy storage systems with retired batteries. Establishing the flow of lithium-ion batteries from a first life in electric vehicles to a second life in stationary energy storage would have another bonus: displacing toxic lead-acid batteries. Only about 60% of lead-acid batteries are used in cars, said Richard Fuller, who leads the non-profit Pure Earth, another 20% are used for storing excess solar power, particularly in African countries. Lead-acid batteries typically last only about two years in warmer climates, said Fuller, as heat causes them to degrade more quickly, meaning they need to be recycled frequently. However, there are few facilities that can safely do this in Africa. Instead, these batteries are often cracked open and melted down in back yards. The process exposes the recyclers and their surroundings to lead, a potent neurotoxin that has no known safe level and can damage brain development in children. Lithium-ion batteries could offer a less toxic and longer-lasting alternative for energy storage, Fuller said. The race to recycle “When a battery really is at the end of its use, then it’s time to recycle it,” Pennington said. There is big momentum behind lithium-ion battery recycling. In its impact report, published in August, Tesla announced that it had started building recycling capabilities at its Gigafactory in Nevada to process waste batteries. Nearby Redwood Materials, founded by the former Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel, which operates out of Carson City, Nevada, raised more than $700m in July and plans to expand operations. The factory takes in dead batteries, extracts valuable materials such as copper and cobalt, then sends the refined metals back into the battery supply chain. Yet, as recycling becomes more mainstream, big technical challenges remain. One of which is the complex designs that recyclers must navigate to get to the valuable components. Lithium-ion batteries are rarely designed with recyclability in mind, said Carlton Cummins, co-founder of Aceleron, a UK battery manufacturing startup. “This is why the recycler struggles. They want to do the job, but they only get introduced to the product when it reaches their door.” Cummins and co-founder Amrit Chandan have targeted one design flaw: the way components are connected. Most components are welded together, which is good for electrical connection, but bad for recycling, Cummins said. Aceleron’s batteries join components with fasteners that compress the metal contacts together. These connections can be decompressed and the fasteners removed, allowing for complete disassembly or for the removal and replacement of individual faulty components. Easier disassembly could also help mitigate safety hazards. Lithium-ion batteries that are not properly handled could pose fire and explosion risks. “If we pick it down to bits, I guarantee you, it’s not going to hurt anyone,” Cummins said. Changing the system Success isn’t guaranteed even if the technical challenges are cracked. History shows how hard it can be to create well-functioning recycling industries. Lead-acid batteries, for example, enjoy high rates of recycling in part due to legal requirements – as much as 99% of lead in automobile batteries is recycled. But they have a toxic cost when they end up at improper recycling facilities. Spent batteries often end up with backyard recyclers because they can pay more for them than formal recyclers, who have to cover higher operating costs. Lithium-ion batteries may be less toxic but they will still need to end up at operations that can safely recycle them. “Products tend to flow through the path of least resistance, so you want to make the path which goes through formal channels less resistant,” Pennington said. Legislation could help. While the US has yet to implement federal policies mandating lithium-ion battery recycling, the EU and China already require battery manufacturers to pay for setting up collection and recycling systems. These funds could help subsidize formal recyclers to make them more competitive, Pennington said. Last December, the EU also proposed sweeping changes to its battery regulations, most of which target lithium-ion batteries. These include target rates of 70% for battery collection, recovery rates of 95% for cobalt, copper, lead and nickel and 70% for lithium, and mandatory minimum levels of recycled content in new batteries by 2030 – to ensure there are markets for recyclers and buffer them from volatile commodity prices or changing battery chemistries. “They aren’t in final form yet, but the proposals that are out there are ambitious,” Richter said. Data could also help. The EU and the Global Battery Alliance (GBA), a public-private collaboration, are both working on versions of a digital “passport” – an electronic record for a battery that would contain information about its whole life cycle. “We are thinking about a QR code or a [radio frequency identification] detection device,” says Torsten Freund, who leads the GBA’s battery passport initiative. It could report a battery’s health and remaining capacity, helping vehicle manufacturers direct it for reuse or to recycling facilities. Data about materials could help recyclers navigate the myriad chemistries of lithium-ion batteries. And once recycling becomes more widespread, the passport could also indicate the amount of recycled content in new batteries. As the automobile industry starts to transform, now is the time to tackle these problems, said Maya Ben Dror, urban mobility lead at the World Economic Forum. The money pouring into the sector offers an “opportunity to ensure that these investments are going to be in sustainable new ecosystems and not just in a new type of car”, she said. It’s also worth noting that sustainable transport goes beyond electric cars, said Richter. Walking, biking or taking public transportation should not be overlooked, she said. “It’s important to remember that we can have a sustainable product situated within an unsustainable system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/feb/07/michael-mccormack-says-agriculture-could-be-excluded-from-2050-net-zero-emissions-target","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-02-07T02:32:16Z","webTitle":"Michael McCormack says agriculture could be excluded from 2050 net zero emissions target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/07/michael-mccormack-says-agriculture-could-be-excluded-from-2050-net-zero-emissions-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/feb/07/michael-mccormack-says-agriculture-could-be-excluded-from-2050-net-zero-emissions-target","fields":{"headline":"Michael McCormack says agriculture could be excluded from 2050 net zero emissions target","bodyText":"The Coalition is facing an increasingly testy party room as it struggles to land on a climate policy, with the Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, declaring he is “not worried about what might happen in 30 years’ time”. The deputy prime minister said excluding agriculture from Australia’s attempts to reach net zero emissions by 2050 may be one option. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said he would like to see Australia reach such a target but has not formally committed to it. New Zealand has set a framework for its path to net zero emissions by 2050 but has provided an exemption for farming. Some Australian Nationals MPs, including the former party leader Barnaby Joyce and Senator Matt Canavan, have been increasingly vocal about quarantining industries such as agriculture and mining from any target Australia signs up to. McCormack told Sky News on Sunday that while Australia must do its “international bit”, regional Australia should not be made to suffer. “There is no way we are going to whack regional Australia, hurt regional Australia, in any way shape or form just to get a target for climate in 2050,” he said. “We are not going to hurt those wonderful people that put food on our table.” Australia is facing increasing pressure to commit to a net zero 2050 target in line with the Paris agreement after the election of the US president, Joe Biden, who has made climate policy a priority. Morrison has not advanced Australia’s progress on the issue, instead committing to make changes “through technology, not taxation” – despite taxation not being an option put on the table by any major party, including the opposition, which is yet to lay out its plan. The prime minister has indicated his government is considering a formal target but has yet to commit. “Our goal is to reach net zero emissions as soon as possible, and preferably by 2050,” he said last week. But in a sign of just how difficult crafting a consensus climate policy can be within the Coalition, Morrison’s deputy said the future was not a priority for him. “We are not worried, or I’m certainly not worried, about what might happen in 30 years’ time,” McCormack said. “The concentration at the moment, indeed for me, for the National party and, indeed, for regional Australia is getting back on our feet after what’s been a very challenging year.” Australia is not on track to meet its 2030 target of a 26% to 28% emissions reduction below 2005 levels. The latest projection shows Australia falling short by 4% to 6%, with just 10 years left to the deadline. The projected drop – 6.8% this decade – is prefaced on changes in the energy market, with a surge of wind and solar power expected to come on line. The government has also ruled out subsidies to make new generation electric vehicles cheaper, as other developed nations have done, and assumes transport emissions will continue to rise over the coming decade, with the cost and lack of infrastructure leading to a slower take-up of electric vehicles than across the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2021/dec/30/pop-rock-and-classical-music-in-2022-abba-to-zappa","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-30T06:00:43Z","webTitle":"Abba to Zappa: pop, rock and classical music to look forward to in 2022","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/30/pop-rock-and-classical-music-in-2022-abba-to-zappa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2021/dec/30/pop-rock-and-classical-music-in-2022-abba-to-zappa","fields":{"headline":"Abba to Zappa: pop, rock and classical music to look forward to in 2022","bodyText":"Black Country New Road – Ants from Up There Knotty, arty, indebted to the post-rock of Slint, bedecked with sprechgesang vocals and unruly sax, Black Country New Road’s debut album, For the First Time, was acclaimed as one of 2021’s best: Chaos Space Marine, the first track to be released from its follow-up, suggests things continuing in a suitably abstruse vein. • Released on 4 February Dave One of many artists belatedly touring a highlight album of 2021 – We’re All in This Alone Together was as well-received as Dave’s Mercury prize-winning 2019 debut, Psychodrama. There’s a convincing argument that he’s currently the best rapper in Britain: it’s hard to think of anyone else addressing serious issues so eloquently. • Tour begins 15 February, Motorpoint Arena Nottingham Guns N’ Roses – Hard Skool Not an album, but an EP, containing two new songs – Hard Skool and Absurd, both leftovers from 2008’s preposterous Chinese Democracy – but the fact that it’s the first new GNR release to feature guitarist Slash and bassist Duff McKagan for more than 25 years gives it cachet. • 25 February Stormzy A belated victory lap, biggest-ever tour for UK rap’s biggest star – including three nights at London’s O2 Arena – that was meant to be in support of his 2019 album Heavy Is the Head but ended up being delayed twice as a result of Covid. • Tour begins 13 March, Motorpoint Arena Cardiff Midlake – For the Sake of Bethel Woods The first album in eight years from the revered US folk-rock band – who apparently reconvened after keyboard player Jesse Chandler’s late father appeared to him in a dream and told him to “get the band back together”. Single Meanwhile… is an enticing taster: a lovely, softly psychedelic glide. • 18 March Let’s Eat Grandma – Two Ribbons Three years on from their award-winning second studio album I’m All Ears, the off-beam duo of Rosa Walton and Jenny Hollingworth return. The two tracks released thus far see them staying on the path that’s led from weird teenage curiosity status to a cheeringly idiosyncratic take on pop. • 8 April Wet Leg – Wet Leg Wet Leg were one of 2021’s big alt-rock breakthroughs: the deadpan Chaise Longue was one of the year’s best singles. But it also had a certain kind of novelty about it – the funny track at No 6 in John Peel’s Festive 50, for those old enough to remember such things. Their eponymous debut album should establish whether they’re in it for the long haul. • 8 April Dua Lipa The weird time-lag caused by Covid in full effect: here’s Dua Lipa finally touring the biggest pop album of 2020, Future Nostalgia, at the point where, ordinarily, you would be thinking about a follow-up. Still, the songs are fabulous pop-disco confections and given the strong visual identity she has developed, you’d imagine the staging will be something else. • Tour begins 15 April, AO Arena Manchester Michael Kiwanuka The 2020 Mercury prize winner is one of Britain’s finest singer-songwriters: his loose, emotive, powerful hybrid of soul, psychedelia and funk is hugely impressive; his live performances, where the songs are allowed space to stretch out, are consistently fantastic. • Tour begins 6 May, O2 Academy Glasgow Lorde Her third album, Solar Power, won a decidedly mixed response: for every critic enthralled by its homespun, understated quality, another found it underbaked and solipsistic. But she’s a reliably compelling and inventive live performer: it should be intriguing to see what she cooks up for this tour. • Tour begins 25 May, O2 Academy Leeds Abba Quite what form Abba’s virtual return to the stage will take remains a closely guarded secret. “Abbatars” are involved, as is a full live band, but not, as most people seemed to assume, holograms. It has to be something special to warrant the hype that has built up around the shows in recent months. • Tour begins 27 May, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London Billie Eilish Another female artist whose eagerly awaited 2021 album saw her deliberately stepping back from the overheated climate of pop mania – the sonically muted Happier Than Ever largely depicted being a teenage superstar as a life of misery. Whether that mutes the chorus of teenage screams at these arena gigs remains to be seen. • Tour begins 3 June, SSE Arena Belfast Diana Ross Ross’s most recent album, Thank You, was pretty awful, but – with all due respect – who goes to see Diana Ross in 2022 in the hope of hearing new material? Better to focus on the setlist from her 2020 US dates, which was as packed with Supremes and disco-era hits as anyone could wish. • Tour begins 10 June, Cardiff Castle Download An impressive number of big-hitters at the summer’s biggest metal event, fully covering the hard rock waterfront: Kiss, Iron Maiden and Biffy Clyro headline; Deftones, Korn, Megadeth and Sepultura lurk a little further down the bill; should Dying Fetus, Venom Prison or Malevolence be more your thing they’re appearing, too. • 10-12 June, Donnington Park, Derby Sam Fender Fender’s UK arena tour in spring is already sold out, evidence of a soaring popularity founded in the fact that there isn’t really anyone else like him at the moment: a young artist making stadium-ready guitar rock with a furious political bent. There is strong support at this 40,000-capacity gig from Fontaines DC and Beabadoobee, among others. • 15 July, Finsbury Park, London All Points East/Field Day Six events over two weekends, with a spectacular lineup: Gorillaz, Idles, Kraftwerk, the Chemical Brothers, Tame Impala, Nick Cave, the National, Dry Cleaning, Self Esteem, Greentea Peng, Floating Points, Perfume Genius and a host more, making it the ideal event for anyone who fancies an eclectic array of artists. • 19, 20, 25-28 August, Victoria Park, London End of the Road Only one artist is thus far confirmed for the 2022 End of the Road – Pixies – but the lineup is invariably well-curated and eclectic, lurking somewhere between leftfield alt-rock, folk dance music and, increasingly, jazz. The beautiful surroundings, complete with peacocks, make End of the Road one of the most loved of the larger boutique festivals. • 1-4 Sepember, Larmer Tree Gardens, near Blandford, Dorset The Cure In 2022, the Cure will be 44 years old. With a mammoth back catalogue to wrangle, their gigs have become epics: when they last played live, in 2019, their average set featured 27 songs. They last put out a new album in 2008, but two – possibly their last – are apparently planned for release at some point. • Tour begins 1 December, 3Arena Dublin Rosalía – Motomani Rosalía’s 2018 album El Mal Querer – a brilliant fusion of flamenco and experimental electronic music – catapulted the Spanish singer-songwriter to global stardom. Its follow-up is, in her own words, “brave”, “very different” and apparently influenced by the sound of reggaeton. • Release date TBC Arctic Monkeys That the band are headlining the Reading and Leeds festivals indicates a new album is incoming (they were spotted recording it in Suffolk over the summer). However, details are scarce about the follow-up to 2018’s Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino – a relative commercial disappointment compared with its immediate predecessor, the multi-platinum global smash AM. • Release date TBC Classical and opera The Ordering of Moses Seventy years after it was composed, Canadian American Robert Nathaniel Dett’s oratorio “from scripture and folklore” finally receives its first performance in Britain. Joshua Wielerstein conducts the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and Chorus; Chrystal E Williams and Rodrick Dixon are the soloists. • Symphony Hall, Birmingham, 23 February Toward the Unknown Region – RVW 150 To mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of Ralph Vaughan Williams, the Hallé Orchestra and the BBC Philharmonic share a cycle of his nine symphonies. Ryan Wigglesworth, Mark Elder and Andrew Davis and John Wilson are the conductors, and the programmes include other VW works, including Job and Toward the Unknown Region. • Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, 26 February – 12 May Tamara Stefanovich: 20 Sonatas A history of the piano sonata in three recitals: the ever-imaginative Tamara Stefanovich presents a marathon guide to the evolution of the most significant of musical forms. Domenico Scarlatti and Soler provide the baroque starting points for her survey, which extends into the 20th century with works by Hindemith, Eisler and Ustvolskaya. • Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, 27 February America, the Beautiful The centrepiece of violinist Pekka Kuusisto’s residency with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra is the UK premiere of Shrink, the concerto written for him in 2019 by Nico Muhly. It’s embedded in an all-American programme that also includes Missy Mazzoli’s Dissolve, O My Heart, Barber’s Adagio for Strings and Copland’s Appalachian Spring. • Holy Trinity, St Andrews, 16 March; Queen’s Hall, Edinburgh, 17 March; City Halls, Glasgow, 18 March Peter Grimes Deborah Warner follows her much admired 2019 Royal Opera production of Billy Budd with another Britten staging, which was first seen in Madrid last May. Allan Clayton takes the title role, with Maria Bengtsson as Ellen Orford and Bryn Terfel as Balstrode; Mark Elder conducts. • Royal Opera House, London, 17-31 March SoundState Five days of new music with the London Philharmonic and Philharmonia orchestras, London Sinfonietta, Arditti Quartet and Bang On a Can All-Stars. Soloists include Nicolas Hodges, Meredith Monk, Mark Knoop and Clare Chase, while among the dozen premieres are works by Rebecca Saunders, George Lewis, Mason Bates, Tansy Davies, Betsy Jolas, Liza Lim and Alex Paxton. • Southbank Centre, London, 30 March-3 April The Strauss Project Andris Nelsons conducts both his orchestras in four concerts devoted to Richard Strauss. His Barbican appearances with the Leipzig Gewandhaus focus on the symphonic poems, while at the Royal Festival Hall the Boston Symphony programmes feature An Alpine Symphony and the Symphonia Domestica, prefaced by the Four Last Songs and extracts from the opera Salome respectively. • Barbican, London EC2, 9 and 10 May, Royal Festival Hall, London, 12 and 13 May The Wreckers Glyndebourne’s summer season opens with the first professional production in Britain in more than half a century of Ethel Smyth’s best known opera. Directed by Melly Still and conducted by Robin Ticciati, it will be sung for the first time in French, the original language of the libretto, with a cast headed by Markus Brück and Clémentine Margaine.• Glyndebourne Opera House, Lewes, 21 May-24 June Violet Originally scheduled for last summer’s Aldeburgh festival, Tom Coult’s first opera finally reaches the stage, in Music Theatre Wales’s production, directed by Jude Christian. With a libretto by Alice Birch, it’s the story of a woman who seizes the chance to escape her humdrum life as time accelerates around her. • Snape Maltings, Aldeburgh, 3 and 5 June, then touring Parsifal Opera North follows its hugely successful concert staging of The Ring cycle with a similar treatment of Wagner’s final music drama. Richard Farnes conducts once again, with PJ Harris the director this time; Toby Spence is Parsifal, Brindley Sherratt Gurnemanz and Katarina Karnéus Kundry. • Grand theatre, Leeds, 4-10 June, then touring to 26 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2021/dec/27/engineering-the-future-meet-the-africa-prize-shortlist-innovators","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-27T10:00:49Z","webTitle":"Engineering the future: meet the Africa prize shortlist innovators","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/27/engineering-the-future-meet-the-africa-prize-shortlist-innovators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2021/dec/27/engineering-the-future-meet-the-africa-prize-shortlist-innovators","fields":{"headline":"Engineering the future: meet the Africa prize shortlist innovators","bodyText":"From a solar-powered crib that treats jaundiced babies to fibre made from water hyacinth that absorbs oil spills, innovators from nine African countries have been shortlisted for the Royal Academy of Engineering’s 2022 Africa prize. This year half of the shortlist of 16 are women, and for the first time it includes Togolese and Congolese inventors. The entrepreneurs will undergo eight months of business training and mentoring before a winner is chosen, who will receive £25,000, and three runners-up, who win £10,000 each. All the projects are sustainable solutions to issues such as access to healthcare, farming resilience, reducing waste, and energy efficiency. The Guardian spoke to three of the shortlisted candidates. Virtue Oboro, Nigeria Soon after her son, Tonbra, was born in 2015, Virtue Oboro’s mother noticed the baby’s eyes and skin looked yellow and they rushed him to hospital in Yenagoa, in the southern state of Bayelsa. But three of the hospital’s five phototherapy units for jaundiced babies were faulty and the other two were in use. Tonbra was eventually found a place in a phototherapy unit but, when there was a power cut, he developed severe jaundice. “He had to have an emergency blood transfusion, which was traumatising. We had to buy blood from an external source, which made us nervous. It was really tough,” says Oboro, 32, a graphic artist and product designer. Her boy recovered, but the experience inspired Oboro and her husband to form Tiny Hearts Technology, the creators of Crib A’Glow, a solar-powered portable phototherapy crib that treats and monitors jaundiced newborns. So far, about 300,000 babies have been treated directly with the cribs in hospitals and homes in Nigeria and Ghana. Today, the Tiny Hearts team comprises engineers, designers and paediatricians, and also educates health workers and pregnant women about jaundice, which Oboro believes has saved many more babies. “I didn’t spot the symptoms myself,” she says. “Like many new mothers, I didn’t know about jaundice.” Newborns develop jaundice when their levels of bilirubin – a natural substance formed when red blood cells break down – are abnormally high. It can lead to death and also cause brain damage, cerebral palsy and hearing loss. Although it is common – affecting about 60% of newborns worldwide – devices to treat babies with blue-light therapy are expensive and unsuitable for poorly resourced hospitals with unreliable electricity. About 100,000 deaths from jaundice are recorded annually and many more babies suffer permanent injury. It took Oboro five attempts to perfect the design for Crib A’Glow, which runs on solar power, is foldable and costs about a tenth of phototherapy devices used in developed countries. The light rays focus on the baby’s body to ensure maximum efficiency, and using LED lights avoids skin burns, dehydration and rashes that can be common side-effects of such devices, she says. “Not only does the crib provide access to phototherapy, it provides phototherapy that is sustainable and lasts long enough for the baby to recover. This also reduces congestion in hospitals in Nigeria because babies recover more quickly,” says Oboro, adding that the cribs can be moved next to their mothers’ beds during treatment. “Because of Covid, other causes of infant mortality, such as jaundice, have not been given much attention. But Covid didn’t make the other problems go away. “The crib will reduce infant mortality and disabilities in Nigeria, and make the job of healthcare workers easier,” says Oboro, who is developing a solar-powered incubator and hopes to form partnerships with development agencies and donors to take her innovations across the continent. The crib is already used in 70 hospitals across Nigeria. “We import a high proportion of medical devices – but it is important to have homegrown solutions that are accessible and affordable for every community here. Healthcare providers can quickly provide feedback on homegrown devices,” she says. “The hardest part for us was acceptability. At first, it was difficult to convince people the crib would be effective,” Oboro says, “partly because I’m not from a medical background. But it’s as if a battle was fought and won – now my son and I feel like winners every day.” Divin Kouebatouka, Republic of the Congo So destructive is the water hyacinth plant to lakes and rivers in Africa that fishermen call it “the curse”, says Divin Kouebatouka, a 32-year-old engineer who is the first Congolese innovator on the shortlist. “When I returned to my mother’s village on the banks of Lake Djoue after studying engineering abroad, I saw an invasive plant that had literally invaded the lake, blocked marine navigation and asphyxiated the fish,” he says. “It had halted fishing activity, which is the main economic resource of the village.” Kouebatouka, a Colorado State University graduate who says he is motivated by protecting the environment after being struck by the impact of the climate crisis on the Congo at a young age, began to think about possible benefits of the water hyacinth plant, which is native to the Amazon basin but now found across the world and whose rapid spread has been intensified by global heating. “We studied the properties of hyacinth and found it is rich in nitrate, which is good for compost; rich in protein, which is good for animal feed; and it has a high absorbency,” he says. “It could also solve another environmental problem: the leakage of oil – the main cause of marine pollution in the Congo. So we decided to create a ‘bridge’ between two environmental problems – each one should be a solution to the other.” His team at Green Tech Africa developed a way to turn the plant’s stems into highly absorbent fibre that can suck up oil from the ground or water, or plug an oil leak in a container. Today more than 10 companies buy the product, called Kukia, which can hold up to 17 times its weight in hydrocarbons, the compounds that form the basis of crude oil. In 2018 the idea was nominated for the African entrepreneurship award. The Republic of the Congo has large reserves of crude oil and natural gas. Oil spills are common in industrial processes and the automotive and shipping industries. Kukia is sold to petrochemical and pollution control companies and the public through fuel stations and wholesalers. The project has also provided employment for local people who collect the plant and produce the fibre, earning more than the average agricultural wage. There are almost 900 collectors, 80% of whom are women. “We collected more than 5,000 cubic metres of water hyacinth – equivalent to two football stadiums of water hyacinth – on the banks of the Congo River, which made it possible to restore the waterways, promote the resumption of fishing and restore economic activities for a population of more than 100,000 people,” says Kouebatouka. “Parts of the plant that aren’t useful for the fibre are used elsewhere – roots are composted and leaves turned into animal feed. Once the stem fibre has been used on an oil spill or leak, it can be repurposed as a fuel source by cement factories,” he says. For Green Tech Africa, the next step is to establish a biorefinery to produce energy and a range of products from the invasive plants. “We’ve turned a botanical problem into a solution for an environmental problem, creating employment and skills development along the way. Kukia is simple, scalable and effective, and can make an enormous difference in Congo and worldwide.” Norah Magero, Kenya “I get emotional when I think about how many children missed out on vaccinations because of Covid,” says Norah Magero, a mechanical engineer. “The pandemic put huge pressure on hospitals and healthcare workers. In Africa, 23 million children [under the age of one] did not get vaccinated because of Covid.” In Kenya, the pandemic highlighted the lack of “cold-chain” infrastructure for storing vaccines, which 33-year-old Magero experienced. “Soon after I had my child in 2018, I moved from Nairobi to a rural area. I realised it was really hard to get her vaccinated. There were so many blackouts and ice-packs melted, so vaccines were no longer viable. “Digging deeper, I realised the problem was not just the lack of reliable power, but also that women who had gone once or twice to get the vaccines might not go back a third time. It might be expensive or difficult to travel and so they just gave up. I might have had the same thought myself – this is just too difficult. “I am an engineer and an energy manager and so I asked myself: why isn’t there an engineering solution to this problem. I am passionate about bringing up technology because it plays a huge role in closing the gaps. But it has to be affordable.” The organisation Magero founded, Drop Access, hopes to close the gap with VacciBox, a mobile solar-powered fridge that safely stores and delivers temperature-sensitive vaccines to communities and hospitals where there is a lack of cold-chain infrastructure. “Hospitals are in a race against time with vaccines and that is the case in most rural communities,” she says. “We need a solution to stop thousands of people missing out on life-saving vaccines.” The solar fridge has a data-monitoring facility and battery backup so it does not run out of power. Costing €800 (£680) to produce, the 40-litre box can be carried on motorbikes, bicycles and boats. “So far, we have piloted the fridge at two rural healthcare facilities. The first is at Merrueshi village health centre in Kajiado county in Kenya, located in a Maasai conservancy. The facility faces frequent power outages and used to use a soda fridge to store vaccines. It is the nearest health centre for a population of at least 400,000. “Every Wednesday, Maasai women would walk for miles to bring their children to be vaccinated. Currently, with VacciBox, the health centre can conduct field-based and door-to-door vaccinations, which has increased their monthly vaccination numbers by 150%.” The second trial is at the Usungu dispensary in Makueni county, 14 miles (22km) from the nearest electricity grid. The health worker used to transport vaccines twice a week from the nearest hospitals and return what was left at the end of the day or when ice-packs began to melt. With VacciBox, the dispensary can stock up to 1,000 vaccines a week without worrying about the vaccines spoiling. Magero says so far the team has carried out 2,100 vaccinations, mostly of children, and intends to expand into Covid vaccinations. “The AstraZeneca vaccine operates within that 2C to 8C [35.6F-46.4F] temperature range we cover,” she says. By 2024, she hopes to have produced 1,500 units and to have vaccinated 3 million children. The box can also be used to transport blood and tissue and can be monitored remotely before deciding to send out a technician if it stops working. An app helps keep track of the condition of the unit as well as the stock and distribution. “Throughout this process, I have been through a range of emotions – from frustration to scepticism to pride,” says Magero. “I had the feeling that I cannot just vaccinate my daughter – she needs classmates and friends. So this is for the mothers – and for all of Kenya.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2020/sep/03/tory-peer-sandip-verma-accused-of-breaching-ministerial-code-with-uganda-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-03T12:01:28Z","webTitle":"Tory peer accused of breaching ministerial code with Uganda deals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/03/tory-peer-sandip-verma-accused-of-breaching-ministerial-code-with-uganda-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2020/sep/03/tory-peer-sandip-verma-accused-of-breaching-ministerial-code-with-uganda-deal","fields":{"headline":"Tory peer accused of breaching ministerial code with Uganda deals","bodyText":"A Conservative peer has been accused of breaching the ministerial code after her family firm signed multimillion-pound deals to supply Uganda’s government with solar power equipment. Sandip Verma’s company, Nexus Green, has signed two deals worth more than £88m after meetings with the sub-Saharan country’s notoriously homophobic president, Yoweri Museveni. Lady Verma appears to have broken ministerial rules after joining the company as chair and director without informing the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba). She was present when Nexus Green signed an £8m deal to provide the Ugandan military with solar power, eight months after leaving her job as a junior development minister. According to rules to ensure transparency, ministers are supposed to declare all roles and jobs for up to two years after leaving office. The deals have surprised other suppliers in the African solar power market. Verma and her son Rikki are the only directors, they have no previous experience in the industry, and the company does not have a website. The Ugandan government also signed an agreement with the firm last September to build a factory to make solar equipment. According to the agreement, most of it would be financed by applying for a loan worth more than £80m from UK Export Finance (UKEF), which is an export credit agency and a government department. Preet Kaur Gill, the shadow development secretary, called for Boris Johnson to launch an inquiry, saying: “The guidance on accepting an appointment after leaving ministerial office is clear. “The prime minister must immediately instigate a full investigation to confirm whether Baroness Verma broke the high standards expected of ministers by both the ministerial code and the public. “Ministers cannot be allowed to abuse their position for personal gain and if she is found to have broken the code then the prime minister must act to reassure the public that he will not tolerate such violations.” Verma, 61, a former parliamentary candidate who was made a life peer in 2006, was a junior minister in the Department of Energy and Climate Change from 2012 to 2015, and then for International Development (DfID) from May 2015 to July 2016. She stood last year to become mayor of her home city of Leicester, many of whose residents were forced to leave Uganda in the 1970s. Contacted by the Guardian, Verma said she believed she did not break the rules on declarations of interest because Nexus Green was an energy firm and not connected to her last role in DfID. “If it relates to a ministerial position then you have got to declare it. “I did not have to declare this because I had left energy many years earlier,” she said. Museveni, Uganda’s leader since 1986, has been internationally condemned for refusing to relinquish power, intimidating, torturing and jailing political opponents and for introducing anti-LGBT laws that punish gay sex with long prison sentences. The former soldier, who was involved in toppling previous leaders Idi Amin and Milton Obote, has met Verma, on at least three occasions. In an hour-long New Year’s Day speech in 2018 he mentioned Nexus Green’s plans to supply solar equipment. Verma, whose Twitter account displays a rainbow flag flying above parliament and describes herself as an “activist for equal opportunities, diversity and inclusion”, said she did not raise Uganda’s anti-LGBT legislation when she met Museveni. “I go there for whatever purposes I am going for and I am not raising that issue [of gay rights] at this moment in time,” she said. Verma met Ugandan government officials on at least one occasion while she was a minister – on 12 September 2015 in London, at a convention to discuss investment opportunities in sectors such as energy. The following month Rikki became director of Nexus Green, a company based in a building in Leicester jointly owned by his parents. Rikki, who sometimes uses the title “honourable” because he is the son of a peer, has been described as the chief executive of the company, while his mother is the chair. The £8m agreement with the Ugandan government to provide its military facilities with off-the-grid solar energy infrastructure was signed in February 2017 and was witnessed by Museveni and Verma. In January this year, as part of a push to strike deals outside the EU, DfIT announced 27 deals across Africa, including Nexus Green’s plan to export £80m of solar-powered water pumping systems for irrigation in Uganda. The Ugandan parliament’s national economy committee has written (pdf) that Nexus Green plans to establish a factory in Uganda to make solar-powered irrigation equipment and install the systems. Last September, the committee signed off a proposal to try to borrow up to £90m from UKEF for the development of solar-powered irrigation. It is understood that an application for a loan has been received but has not been approved. A UKEF spokeswoman said she could not comment on speculation about potential transactions for reasons of commercial confidentiality. “UKEF undertakes rigorous due diligence including checks against financial crime, bribery and corruption, prior to any support being provided.” A spokesperson on behalf of Verma said there had been no impropriety in the activities of Nexus Green. “Baroness Verma has never lobbied the UK government on their behalf and has never sought to inappropriately use her ministerial career for the company’s benefit. Any suggestion Baroness Verma has is farcical, not least because when in office her ministerial brief did not cover Uganda,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/oct/13/liz-truss-conservatives-tories-labour-uk-politics-latest-live-news-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T21:47:47Z","webTitle":"Kwasi Kwarteng says ‘let’s see’ when asked about potential U-turn on corporation tax – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/oct/13/liz-truss-conservatives-tories-labour-uk-politics-latest-live-news-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/oct/13/liz-truss-conservatives-tories-labour-uk-politics-latest-live-news-updates","fields":{"headline":"Kwasi Kwarteng says ‘let’s see’ when asked about potential U-turn on corporation tax – as it happened","bodyText":"Kwasi Kwarteng’s response was “let’s see” when grilled about an imminent U-turn on his flagship cut to corporation tax. The chancellor told the Telegraph that ensuring corporation tax stayed “competitive” remained a “great idea”, but did not rule out increasing the current 19% rate. In response to a question about how markets “have improved today because they think you’re about to do a U-turn on corporation tax”, Kwarteng said: “Let’s see.” The chancellor earlier said his “total focus is on delivering on the mini-budget” in response to speculation about a U-turn on the measures. Kwarteng said he is “not going anywhere”. Liz Truss is on the cusp of putting up corporation tax as part of a Downing Street plan to back down from the huge package of unfunded tax cuts in her mini-budget, sources claim. Senior Conservatives are holding talks about replacing Liz Truss with a joint ticket of Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt as part of a “coronation” by MPs, according to The Times. Party grandees are understood to be in talks about replacing Truss with a “unity candidate” Former home secretary Priti Patel has become the latest high-profile Tory MP to suggest the government could be forced into a further U-turn over the mini-budget. Patel was asked if Liz Truss’s commitment not to raise corporation tax should be reversed to calm the markets. “There is an irony to this,” Patel told Sky News. “In that market forces will probably dictate some of these changes now. “The market is going to dictate this, primarily because we want to see stability.” The former Conservative chancellor George Osborne has questioned why Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng would wait till 31 October to perform an “inevitable U-turn” on their mini-budget. Osborne tweeted: “Given the pain being caused to the real economy by the financial turbulence, it’s not clear why it is in anyone’s interests to wait 18 more days before the inevitable u-turn on the mini budget.” Labour MP Christina Rees has been stripped of the party whip after allegations of bullying her constituency staff, the Guardian can reveal. Rees, who was shadow Wales secretary during Jeremy Corbyn’s time as leader, will now sit as an independent in the House of Commons. It is understood that there will be an internal Labour party investigation into the allegations and Rees, the MP for Neath, will have her party membership suspended until the case is resolved. Downing Street has refused to rule out the prospect that some government departments could face cuts to their budgets. Overall government spending will continue to rise in real terms, the PM’s official spokesperson said. The latest YouGov/Times voting intention poll shows Labour maintaining the massive lead they opened up over the Conservatives last month. The figures show the Tories on 23% of the vote (up by one point from the previous poll) to Labour’s 51% (which is down one point). Labour has pledged to ban fracking “once and for all” as it hit out at suggestions that the government could move to ban solar farms from much of England’s farmland. The party intends to work with MPs who oppose fracking to force the government to maintain the ban, one of several issues to divide the Conservatives since Liz Truss became leader. The new administration’s environmental commitments have come under severe scrutiny in recent weeks after lifting England’s fracking ban, in place since 2019 following a series of earth tremors, and giving the green light to the expansion of oil and gas operations in the North Sea. Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow climate secretary, will visit Bassetlaw on Friday to meet with the party’s candidate Jo White and local residents to listen to concerns about the potential for fracking in their area. Labour is working to bring forward an opposition day motion to maintain the current ban, Miliband is expected to tell locals during his visit. He said: “Labour will stand with communities in opposing the Conservatives’ dodgy plans to impose expensive, dirty, and dangerous fracking on the British people. “Fracking would make no difference to energy prices, and could risk the health of local communities, nature, and water supplies.” A senior Tory MP believes it is “premature” for the party to think about getting rid of Liz Truss, amid reports that some Conservatives are holding talks about replacing the prime minister with a joint ticket of former leadership contenders Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt. The MP told the PA news agency that it would be seen as “completely bonkers to have three prime ministers in one year”. Anna Soubry, a former Conservative MP, has said it is time for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to be prime minister. In response to a tweet asking “is it time for Rishi”, Soubry, a criminal lawyer, said: “It’s time for #KeirStarmer - he’d be a prime minister we could trust to deliver what we desperately need - stability, competence and honesty.” Senior Conservatives are holding talks about replacing Liz Truss with a joint ticket of Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt as part of a “coronation” by MPs, according to The Times. Party grandees are understood to be in talks about replacing Truss with a “unity candidate”. An MP told the newspaper: “Rishi’s people, Penny’s people and the sensible Truss supporters who realise she’s a disaster just need to sit down together and work out who the unity candidate is. “It’s either Rishi as prime minister with Penny as his deputy and foreign secretary, or Penny as prime minister with Rishi as chancellor. “They would promise to lead a government of all the talents and most MPs would fall in behind that.” Here is a selection of some of Friday’s front pages. In the latest round of extraordinary polling, a survey by People Polling for the Daily Telegraph has found Labour’s lead has stretched to a huge 34 points, with Labour on 53% and the Conservatives at just 19%. In worse news for Liz Truss, just 9% of the public have a favourable view of her. Prof Matthew Goodwin, the pollster behind the research, told the newspaper [£]: “These numbers mean that Liz Truss is more unpopular than Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn ever were – she is basically in what I would call Prince Andrew territory.” Liz Truss has bowed to intense pressure from Conservative MPs and the markets by agreeing to redraw her mini-budget, paving the way for a major U-turn on her signature corporation tax cut. In another serious blow to her authority as prime minister, government sources told the Guardian that a climbdown on the plan to scrap the rise in corporation tax was now “on the table”. After weeks of defending the proposal, Downing Street officials and ministers are now trying to balance the books after announcing a huge package of unfunded tax cuts. Read our full story of the day’s events here The former minister Johnny Mercer has hit out at the government as he shared how his constituents have been impacted by rising interest rates after the mini-budget. He described the impact on mortgage holders and people seeking to buy a home as “politically unsurvivable”. He tweeted: “Dozens of these across Plymouth. I want you to know that I get it, that most of us get it, and that we will do all we can to change it. “Heartbreaking. Unconscionable. Politically unsurvivable. I got into politics to help people like this. Will not stand and watch it burn.” Alicia Kearns, the new chairwoman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, suggested the government’s tax cuts should be scrapped to calm the markets. She was asked on LBC’s Tonight With Andrew Marr whether she would like to see the tax cuts reversed. “Do I think we should be borrowing en masse where our children have to pay this back for decades to come? No, I don’t,” she said. Pressed by Marr, she stressed that sometimes governments need to take “extraordinary steps”. “But clearly, in the approach and the manner in which this has been done, that is the issue. Because the markets are not woke, the markets are not left. “The fact they are not lefty, anti-government, the fact they have been spooked, is something that should be taken incredibly seriously. And often it is about the manner, and the fact is we govern only with the support of the people, and we are not bringing them with us currently. “We all want Liz Truss to succeed in that the country needs her to succeed. And it is about recognising that actually, sometimes baby steps can result in more meaningful and embraced change than perhaps a bonfire.” Giles Wilkes, a former special advisor to Theresa May, believes Liz Truss is facing “possibly the most difficult situation a prime minister has been in this side of the Second World War”. Wilkes, a senior fellow at the Institute of Government, told Sky News: “I can’t think of somebody who’s put themselves into such a position where they’re forced to defend something that nobody else thinks is defensible, and forced to contemplate really tough measures like slashing benefits or slashing important government spending budgets in order to try to keep a policy that nobody else believes can go on the road. “It’s an incredibly difficult position, but right now, she’s playing for survival stakes. She has to think, ‘what do I need to throw overboard in order to keep things going?’ And if it’s pretty much all the policies announced in the so-called mini budget, then that’s the only thing I can think she can do.” Wilkes said it is difficult to see how the Conservative party could justify a change of leadership without a general election and a U-turn on the mini-budget “might be the only way the government can actually get out of this self-made disaster”. The prime minister has been warned not to row back on key social care reforms as this would be to “abandon some of the most vulnerable people in our society”. Sir Andrew Dilnot said pulling back on promised reforms would be “deeply regrettable”, and that he hopes Liz Truss is the PM who “finally” sees through substantial change for the sector. Sir Andrew, who led a review into the future of funding social care under the coalition government and was the architect of the original plans for a care cap, said it is “absolutely essential” the current government’s planned reforms while “less generous” than those he set out, go ahead as scheduled. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Reforming social care is a priority. That’s why we’re backing the sector with £5.4 billion over the next three years to support our planned reforms, bolster the workforce and protect people from unpredictable care costs. “We are working with local authorities, our charging reform trailblazers, care providers and other stakeholders - including the Local Government Association - to implement the changes and make sure everyone can access the care they need, when they need it.” Liz Truss put adherence to principle at the heart of her bid for the leadership of the Conservative party, often using her support for cutting corporation tax to illustrate a wider preference for letting people and businesses keep more of their own money. However, now the policy has been mooted as one of those that could be chopped to help fill a £65bn black hole of unfunded revenue loss in the mini-budget. These are the pledges Truss and some of her most senior supporters made during the course of her campaign and premiership so far: Former home secretary Priti Patel has also spoken about her time as a politician, citing her personal experience of harassment. She told Sky News: “I’ve had consistent levels of, I think, harassment and abuse. “So harassment is just intimidation, unkind things that obviously are said to me.” The BBC has found Gary Lineker in breach of the broadcaster’s own impartiality guidelines after he tweeted about the Conservative party taking money from Russian donors. The Match of the Day presenter made the comment in February while responding to the then-foreign secretary, Liz Truss. She had said English football teams should not play in the Champions League final then to be held in Russia, due to the invasion of Ukraine. Lineker quote-tweeted Truss’s demand with the observation: “And her party will hand back their donations from Russian donors?” Jim O’Neill, a crossbench peer who worked as a Treasury minister for George Osborne, said Kwarteng should abandon his mini budget and announce the reversal today. “As tough as it is politically, the quicker they reverse the better. To carry on down this path is not far off insanity,” he told Radio 4. The problem is that it gets worse by the day,” he said. “Even if the markets are becalmed by the Bank of England’s intervention.” The former chief economist of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, who is conducting a review of business taxes for the Labour Party, said investors and businesses were suspicious of the government’s sincerity after ministers denied the mini budget had triggered chaos in financial markets. “They have awaken any (investors) who has exposure to UK interest rates or the pound anywhere in the world. It is not just a bunch of nasty people. It is people who have to deal with commercial realities,” said. Three options were open to Kwarteng: to reverse all the measures in the mini budget, or to announce benefits cuts and other savings to close the £60bn shortfall in the government’s finances “Or hope for the best and “wing it”, he said. Which is sort of vaguely what they are trying to do. But the markets could cause chaos and it is slightly frightening that they don’t seem to be aware of that.” The prime minister’s economics guru Prof Patrick Minford says it would be “insane” to rip up the mini-budget. He told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme: “It’s really important we don’t do something really stupid at this point. “Liz Truss’s policies for growth are absolutely right and to be thrown off them by a bit of market turbulence is insane.” He argued against U-turns, saying the Bank of England “needs to be much more active in its policies of intervention in the gilts market”. Asked if he had predicted the market turmoil triggered by the mini-budget, the economist said: “Obviously, at the moment, the markets are facing enormous turbulence because of worldwide tightening of money, and so there’s a great deal of nervousness about. “But I think the way to handle that is to deal with market turbulence in our gilts market directly through QE (quantitative easing) and then to keep the policies going.” Kwasi Kwarteng’s response is “let’s see” when grilled about an imminent U-turn on his flagship cut to corporation tax. The chancellor told the Telegraph that ensuring corporation tax stayed “competitive” remained a “great idea”, but did not rule out increasing the current 19% rate. In response to a question about how markets “have improved today because they think you’re about to do a U-turn on corporation tax”, Kwarteng said: “Let’s see.” Speaking in Washington, he also refused to rule out changing other elements of his £43bn package of tax cuts. “I’m not going to play those games about what’s in or out or any of that. What I’m totally focused on is making sure that we get growth in the economy.” Former home secretary Priti Patel has become the latest high-profile Tory MP to suggest the government could be forced into a further U-turn over the mini-budget. In an interview with Sky News, due to be aired in full later, Patel was asked if Liz Truss’s commitment not to raise corporation tax should be reversed to calm the markets. “There is an irony to this,” Patel said. “In that market forces will probably dictate some of these changes now. “The market is going to dictate this, primarily because we want to see stability. Stability is absolutely crucial, for everyone to carry on living their lives, for the institutions to function, but actually for the British people to have the stability that they need in their lives as well. “And by that, as well, I mean mortgages, interest rates and all those crucial, crucial levers.” UK government bonds and the pound rallied amid speculation that Liz Truss’s government could be forced to U-turn on its unfunded tax cut plans. Pressure on gilts - UK government bonds - also eased as the Bank of England sought to steady market sentiment by increasing its bond-buying activity ahead of a Friday deadline. According to reports, No 10 and the Treasury are holding talks over whether to abandon more of the Government’s £43 billion tax-cutting plan which could include reversing the decision to cancel planned rises in income tax. Foreign secretary James Cleverly earlier declined to rule out further U-turns, but insisted the government will “absolutely stick” to its tax-cutting principles. The prime minister’s official spokesman made clear there will be no further changes. The number of mortgage defaults are expected to rise in the coming months, according to Bank of England data released on Thursday, while the number of new loans will continue to fall amid warnings that the “golden era” of cheap deals is ending. The UK central bank’s latest quarterly credit conditions survey paints a gloomy picture, with the number of mortgage deals already falling before the chancellor’s mini-budget on 23 September. Kwasi Kwarteng’s package of unfunded tax cuts led to chaos for homebuyers, with hundreds of fixed-rate deals withdrawn over the space of a few days, before lenders returned with significantly more expensive deals. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said that while there were “global factors at play” in the economic crisis it was vital that “in that environment, don’t fan the flames”. The government are behaving like pyromaniacs, setting ablaze the UK economy,” she told the PA news agency. “It is ordinary working people who are paying the price for that.” Asked if chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng was on borrowed time, she said: “The Prime Minister and Chancellor introduced this package of measures together. “The Prime Minister has been in office for just one month and has already caused so much damage. “The public are sick and tired of it, they want the Government to think again and to U-turn, and if the Government aren’t capable of providing the leadership the country needs, Labour absolutely is.” Ministers have been accused of “escalating harm to patients” by “failing to properly invest in or resource” the NHS, the Guardian’s Andrew Gregory reports. “Our NHS is falling apart before our eyes”, the chair of the BMA, Prof Philip Banfield, said. His remarks come as the latest figures show the number of people waiting for hospital treatment has hit a record high of seven million in England. The international trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, has urged fellow Tory MPs to unite behind Liz Truss and the government’s growth plans. She said she agreed with the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, that “to even talk about changing the leader at this time would be disastrous”. Speaking during a visit to a distillery in East Lothian, Badenoch dismissed talk of a general election. She said: I’m very focused on the prime minister’s growth agenda, selling exports and making sure that we continue to grow and create jobs for people. That is absolutely not the sort of thing that is on my mind at all. John Stevens from the Daily Mirror quotes Treasury sources as saying that Kwasi Kwarteng has not left Washington DC. The chancellor is not attending an IMF meeting of G20 finance ministers because he is in a bilateral meeting with another finance minister, he said. Downing Street has refused to comment on reports that discussions are ongoing at No 10 on U-turns in the government’s mini-budget. Asked whether an imminent change is possible, a No 10 spokesperson said Again, I just have to repeat that our position hasn’t changed and the Chancellor was very clear that he and the PM are working to deliver the growth plan. Asked if talks are being held on possible U-turns, the official said: Again, work is ongoing between the Chancellor and the prime minister, as you’d expect, ahead of the medium-term fiscal plan. The focus of both the Chancellor and the PM are on delivering the growth plan and the position has not changed. On whether there had been discussion about dropping the corporation tax cut, they said: I wouldn’t comment on meetings the prime minister has. A former Conservative chief whip, Julian Smith, has cryptically tweeted the dictionary definition of the word “confidence”. The chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, reportedly did not attend a meeting of G20 finance ministers at the IMF in Washington. Sky News’ Mark Stone says the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, was at the meeting but was told Kwarteng’s deputy would stand in for him. Asked if he knew why the chancellor was not present at the meeting, Bailey said: “That’s a question for the chancellor.” The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, was speaking to reporters in Washington earlier today where she was asked about reports of a UK government U-turn over its mini-budget. Speaking before Kwasi Kwarteng’s interview, Georgieva said it is sometimes right for a “recalibration” of policies. She said: I do believe it is correct to be led by evidence, so if the evidence is that there has to be a recalibration, it is right for governments to do so. She added: Don’t prolong the pain – make sure actions are coherent and consistent. While the chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, has insisted “our position has not changed” in his earlier interview, the Guardian’s Jessica Elgot points out that this isn’t the same as saying “our position will not change”. A former cabinet minister has told the News Agents podcast’s Jon Sopel that Liz Truss “has unleashed hell on this country”. Sopel says the language being used by senior Tories about the PM is like nothing he has seen before. Despite the chaos in Downing Street as officials rake over bits of the mini-budget, Liz Truss put aside around 50 minutes for one of her first “listening exercises” with a handful of Tory MPs. She sought to defuse tensions in the party by inviting them to chat about issues and pet projects in their area over tea and Pret a Manger sandwiches. The PM and a seemingly random assortment of backbenchers from different intakes and regions chatted predominantly about infrastructure, sources told the Guardian. One Truss supporter who attended said she was “very buoyant”, but a sceptic said it was just incredibly awkward. “It’s so fucking transparent,” they sighed. “We’re only there because she’s in trouble.” There was no mention of the elephant in the room – the looming prospect of further U-turns on the mini-budget. The editor of ConservativeHome, Tim Montgomerie, says he would resign if he were in Liz Truss’s position after the country and markets “resoundingly” rejected the PM’s signature agenda. The work and pensions secretary, Chloe Smith, refused point blank to answer questions about the possibility of more U-turns when quizzed following a speech in Westminster about getting more people into jobs. Asked if more tax cuts might be reversed, Smith said: I think you know that I’m not in a position to answer your question this afternoon. She added: I’m going to have to say that quite straightforwardly to you and anyone else who would like to ask the same question – as you know, that will be a matter for the chancellor. Asked a similar question later on in the Q&amp;A, Smith simply ignored the question. The former Conservative chancellor George Osborne has questioned why Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng would wait till 31 October to perform an “inevitable U-turn” on their mini-budget. Labour’s former shadow chancellor Ed Balls says he agrees with Osborne. Here are some more lines from the chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, who has just been speaking from Washington where he is attending the International Monetary Fund’s annual meeting. He said: Our total focus is on delivering on the mini-budget shortfalls and making sure that we get growth back into our economy. That’s the central prize. That’s the main focus of my job. Asked if it was “humiliating” that officials were discussing filleting the fiscal statement he made just weeks ago, Kwarteng replied: I speak to No 10. I speak to the prime minister all the time. We are totally focused on delivering the growth plan. Asked if he would consider his position as chancellor if he had to U-turn on a major part of the mini-budget, he once again refused to answer this directly and said he was “totally focused on the growth agenda”. The chancellor was also asked if he would acknowledge there were specific problems in the UK following his statement. He said: What I am going to acknowledge is the fact that it is a very dicey situation globally. That’s what people are saying to me. He added: I think there was some turbulence after the meeting, but we’re sitting here talking about the global challenges. Everybody is focused on inflation, everybody is affected by potential interest rate rises, everybody’s affected by the energy price spikes, which have been exacerbated by Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine. So everybody across the global financial community is really focusing on the same problems. The chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, said his “total focus is on delivering on the mini-budget” in response to speculation about a U-turn on the measures. Kwarteng said he is “not going anywhere” and refused to rule out any changes in the future. He acknowledged that there was “some turbulence” after the mini-budget but said it’s a “very dicey situation globally”. Speaking from an International Monetary Fund summit, he said: I speak to Number 10, I speak to the prime minister all the time - and we are totally focused on delivering the growth plan. Asked whether Liz Truss will be prime minister next week and whether he will remain chancellor, Kwarteng replied: Absolutely 100%, I’m not going anywhere. The Conservative former minister, Dame Andrea Leadsom, has jumped to Liz Truss’s defence and said the prime minister “needs a chance to settle in” and “get things under control”. Speaking as she picked up her damehood at Buckingham Palace on Thursday, Leadsom said: I think we all have to give the prime minister a chance to settle in. There’s been a huge amount of turmoil over the last few weeks within the nation, and the prime minister must be given a chance to get things under control and start to make progress on what is a very important agenda of growing the economy. The Guardian’s Peter Walker is at a speech by the work and pensions secretary, Chloe Smith, about how to get people into work. Journalists have been told to keep questions “on the topic of the speech” rather than mini-budget U-turns, he says. As the Mirror’s Ashley Cowburn points out, that might not work exactly as Smith’s team hopes. Liz Truss is on the cusp of putting up corporation tax as part of a Downing Street plan to back down from the huge package of unfunded tax cuts in her mini-budget, sources claim. The prime minister has been under intense pressure from jittery Conservative MPs to stage a major economic U-turn to calm the markets in the face of a financial storm. However, the move would represent a massive climbdown as her promise to cancel Rishi Sunak’s plans to put up corporation tax from 19% to 25% was a central pledge of her leadership campaign. One government source told the Guardian that No 10 officials were reviewing the mini-budget in order to shore up Truss’s premiership after Kwasi Kwarteng’s disastrous economic growth plan last month. Another source suggested that the option of raising corporation tax was “on the table” as the prime minister tries to balance the books – although this may be by just one or two per cent. They indicated that no decision would be announced until the chancellor had returned from Washington, where he is at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund, on Friday. However, there was speculation on Whitehall that the scale of the U-turn could make it impossible for Kwarteng to continue in post. Read the full story: The chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, has told Channel 4 News’ Siobhan Kennedy that he will not be pre-empting his Halloween statement. The Spectator’s James Forsyth writes that the government is now facing a new problem. Amid rumours the government could make a U-turn on its plan to not raise corporation taxes, the market has rallied. Now, Liz Truss can’t afford not to U-turn. Robert Shrimsley from the Financial Times has also made this point. The former Conservative chancellor, Lord Norman Lamont, said the choices facing Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng are “appalling” and that he would support a reversal of the mini-budget. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme, he said: Sometimes it’s said that politics is the art of the possible. I think it’s the art of choosing between the incredible and the utterly impossible. The government has three choices, he said: reverse the changes in the mini-budget; make public expenditure cuts, which the PM has ruled out'; or try to “fudge the arrangement” with the Office for Budget Responsibility. He added: If they do reverse the budget, I would support them, but I personally think that’s rather unlikely. The Conservative MP, John Baron, said Liz Truss’s government has displayed a lack of “compassionate conservatism” which has led to a feeling of “caution and concern” among backbenchers. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme, Baron said: The mood, generally, is one of caution and concern. For me, it’s about the lack of compassionate conservatism, the breaking of the link between benefits and inflation during the cost-of-living crisis is wrong. But the optics are also wrong when we’ve also been proposing a cut in the 45p rate of tax. So, that, together with a lack of reassurance to the markets when it came to the mini-budget, about the borrowing and the spending requirements and cuts too, you know, has all added to the general air of concern. Asked if he thinks Truss is a compassionate Conservative, Baron replied: I do. I just think the messaging has been poor and the optics have been terrible. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said reports of potential U-turns on the mini-budget demonstrate that the government is in a state of “utter chaos”. Reeves said: Today’s mess shows the utter chaos this government is in. This is a crisis made in Downing Street and working people are paying the price. Labour has said repeatedly that they need to reverse the kamikaze budget and restore confidence. This is now urgent as the Bank of England’s intervention in the markets ends tomorrow. The Tories cannot allow the chaos caused by their mini-budget to continue any longer. Prof Sir John Curtice, a political scientist and professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, has been talking to the BBC’s World At One programme about the latest polls and the view of Liz Truss in the country. Liz Truss is now deeply unpopular. She is more unpopular than Boris Johnson was at the worst period of his premiership, which was in the middle of January this year when the Partygate scandal was at its height. He says she’s about as popular as John Major was a few weeks after Black Wednesday in September 1992 and he says it feels like history is repeating itself. He says there is a public perception that the government does not know what it is doing and that is leading to market instability. He points out Major was not able to recover from Black Wednesday, despite delivering the economic growth Truss has pinned her future on. Asked how the public feel about Truss, he points out: She has got two problems: one is that she isn’t really liked. Her personality is not one that warms the general public. Secondly, she is regarded as incompetent. The Sun’s Harry Cole is reporting that the prime minister is plotting a “spectacular” U-turn, having made a vow to cancel Rishi Sunak’s corporation tax hike from 19% to 25% the centre of her campaign to be the Tory leader. A senior Labour MP has been stripped of the party whip after allegations of bullying her constituency staff, the Guardian can reveal. Christina Rees, who was shadow Wales secretary during Jeremy Corbyn’s time as leader, will now sit as an independent in the House of Commons. It is understood that there will be an internal Labour party investigation into the allegations and Rees, the MP for Neath, will have her party membership suspended until the case is resolved. Local party members claimed that several of her staff had made detailed statements, which they said were backed up with evidence, to Labour headquarters about claims of bullying. One senior constituency figure claimed the alleged behaviour had been going on for years. Rees, who won the South Wales seat in 2015, taking over from Labour former cabinet minister Peter Hain, will become the 14th MP to sit as an independent, equalling the number of Lib Dem MPs in the Commons. Read the full story here: Many Tory MPs are still waiting to hear the chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, present his debt-cutting plan on 31 October before making a decision about whether to support him and Liz Truss, according to ITV News’ Anushka Asthana. The pound has risen in the last half hour as rumours circulate that the government could make a U-turn on its planned cuts to corporation and dividend taxes. The pound has surged 1.4% to $1.1259 against the dollar. For more business updates, do follow our live blog: BBC Newsnight’s Nicholas Watt has been told by one former cabinet minister to “brace for the mother of all U-turns” on the mini-budget today. Bloomberg is also reporting that officials at No 10 and the Treasury are working on a U-turn for Liz Truss’s mini-budget. Officials are drafting options for Truss but no final decision has been taken and they are waiting for the chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, to return to London from Washington, the news outlet quotes a person familiar with the matter. From Bloomberg’s Kitty Donaldson: Sky News’ Sam Coates writes that “active” discussions are under way in Downing Street over whether to scrap parts of the mini-budget. This is despite the fact that Downing Street has just promised there will not be any more U-turns on the government’s mini-budget. There is “a conversation going on inside government” about “whether or not to junk some of the measures from the mini-budget”, according to Coates. The Tory MP, Christopher Chope, says he has “absolute confidence” in Liz Truss as prime minister and that he believes the Conservative party will win the next general election Descriptions of last night’s 1922 Committee meeting “bear no resemblance to the truth”, Chope told Times Radio. He added: The truth is that the prime minister was in good form. She was calm and confident. If I was a betting man, I would now be going out and putting money on the Conservatives winning the next general election. Downing Street has refused to rule out the prospect that some government departments could face cuts to their budgets. Overall government spending will continue to rise in real terms, the PM’s official spokesperson said. They added: When it comes to departments there is a process to go through which is led by the Treasury. We have made some specific commitments to departments. The prime minister has talked about defence spending, for example. Beyond that, I am not going to get drawn into specific budgets. It is between those departments and the Treasury. The leader of the House of Commons, Penny Mordaunt, has joked that her “resting face” is that of a “bulldog chewing a wasp”. During an exchange in the Commons, Labour’s shadow Commons leader, Thangam Debbonaire, said her counterpart “couldn’t even muster a nod for her prime minister” at yesterday’s PMQs. Mordaunt responded: Let me address the comments the honourable lady makes about my facial expressions: my resting face is that of a bulldog chewing a wasp, and people shouldn’t read too much into that. The i’s Paul Waugh writes that Mordaunt’s performance today in the Commons gives her a prime opportunity to portray herself as a PM-in-waiting. Paul Mason, formerly of Channel 4 News, writes that the smart money is on the imminent exit of Kwasi Kwarteng and his budget. Downing Street has promised there will not be any more U-turns on the government’s mini-budget. Asked if the prime minister promises there will be no further reversals, her official spokesperson said: Yes, as I said to a number of questions on this yesterday, and the position has not changed from what I set out to you all then. Pressed on whether Liz Truss is committed to the timeframes set out for measures in the mini-budget, the official said: Yes, and obviously as you know the date for the medium-term fiscal plan has been brought forward. The former culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has urged Conservative MPs to #backliz just days after calling for a general election. Tory MPs who are discussing who should replace Truss as leader “are not taking into account the fact that they cannot foist upon the British public another prime minister that the public have not voted for”, Dorries wrote on Twitter. Just last week, Dorries suggested Truss should call a general election to obtain a mandate for her policies and said there was “widespread dismay” about the PM’s approach. The government had “no mandate from the people” to scrap its policy promises under Boris Johnson and start from scratch, Dorries argued last Tuesday. She added: If we don’t want to deliver on the deal, the promises, we need a fresh mandate. “It’s how democracy works,” Dorries explained. It appears she is now fine with Britain having had one unelected prime minister, but having two would be a “totally untenable position”. Conservative commentators are beginning to turn against Liz Truss, with rightwing newspapers such as the Sun and Daily Mail rounding on her for making a “pig’s ear” of the mini-budget, while other observers suggest her premiership could be extremely short-lived. Though she was initially heralded by some as a prime minister to drive through true-blue policies with the most radical reforms in decades, unease is growing in Tory circles about her leadership. Recent market turmoil, a series of screeching U-turns and the expectation more will follow are compounding jitters about Truss’s future. The Daily Mail, in its editorial on Thursday, reserved the top slot in its three-pronged editorial column to savage the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, but used the second to raise concerns about Truss. It said her “dash for growth is already limping badly after she made a pig’s ear of presenting her ambitious mini-budget and was forced into humiliating U-turns”. Though critical of her leadership, the Mail, which endorsed Truss during the leadership contest, did say the principle of tax cuts and pursuance of growth was the right one and urged Tory rebels to get behind it. Emblazoned across the rest of the page was a comment piece by its columnist Stephen Glover. One extract read: In her abject powerlessness she is like a leader who has been in office for years and has run out of options and support. But she has only just started! And she has a majority of nearly 70. Meanwhile the Sun, which did not endorse either Truss or Rishi Sunak, used its editorial on Thursday to go after the new prime minister. Read the full story: The latest YouGov/Times voting intention poll shows Labour maintaining the massive lead they opened up over the Conservatives last month. The figures show the Tories on 23% of the vote (up by one point from the previous poll) to Labour’s 51% (which is down one point). Keir Starmer continues to hold a lead over Liz Truss in terms of the party leader Britons think would make the best prime minister, by 42% to 13%. The Times’ Henry Zeffman paints a picture of the scale of the potential rebellion Liz Truss faces from her own MPs. The Home Office has taken the modern slavery brief away from the minister responsible for safeguarding and classed it as an “illegal immigration and asylum” issue, updated online ministerial profiles show. The move is seen as a clear sign that the department is doubling down on Suella Braverman’s suggestion that people are “gaming” the modern slavery system and that victims of the crime are no longer being prioritised. The previous safeguarding minister, Rachel Maclean, had modern slavery on her official list of ministerial responsibilities but her successor, Mims Davies, has no mention of the crime on her list. Instead, modern slavery is listed at the bottom of the “illegal immigration and asylum” brief of immigration minister Tom Pursglove. Under Theresa May, the government pledged to be world leaders in combating modern slavery but Braverman said last week that trafficking claims from “people gaming the system” were “derailing the UK’s policy on illegal migration”. The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: The largest single group of modern slavery victims under the referral system last year were British children – including those who were exploited through county lines. The evidence shows the majority of exploitation takes place in the UK rather than across borders. The government should be treating this as an enforcement and safeguarding issue and taking stronger action against the crime of modern slavery wherever it takes place. Read the full story here: King Charles’s “dear, oh dear” comments to Liz Truss were a sign of his “empathy” towards her, according to the foreign secretary, James Cleverly. Footage emerged yesterday from the prime minister’s audience with the monarch at Buckingham Palace. As Truss curtseyed, and said: “Your Majesty”, Charles replied: “So you’ve come back again?” While Truss replied: “It’s a great pleasure,” he could only mutter: “Dear, oh dear. Anyway …” The clip, which came after another day of turmoil in the economic markets and mutinous plotting on the Conservative party backbenches, quickly went viral. Asked on LBC about the video, Cleverly accused host Nick Ferrari of characterising the King’s comments as a “political statement”. Cleverly said: I view it as much more an empathetic statement. He recognises that all of us - everyone in the country - is dealing with a really tough winter ahead. Here’s the clip in which the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, says removing Liz Truss as prime minister would be a “disastrously bad idea”. And some reaction from journalists to Cleverly’s morning round: Michael Savage from the Observer says Cleverly was being evasive in refusing to rule out further U-turns, instead insisting the government would “absolutely stick” with its tax-cutting principles. HuffPost UK’s Kevin Schofield says it’s astonishing senior cabinet figures are publicly discussing a change in leadership so soon after Truss’s appointment. Kate McCann from TalkTV says Cleverly’s line gives some indication of how badly Truss’s circle think things are going. Liverpool Echo’s Liam Thorp wonders how Cleverly thinks the British economy is doing, if he believes getting rid of Truss would be bad “politically and also economically”. Attending a Nato meeting, the UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said there was no risk that western allies would run out of arms supplies to aid Ukraine against Russia. Wallace said: The UK-Danish joint-led International Fund is all about placing orders in a manufacturing space to make sure that we can go on between ‘23, ‘24, and keep going on. He said the UK would provide Ukraine with air defence systems that would complement US-provided systems. Ukraine faced a barrage of missile strikes earlier this week, damaging civilian infrastructure and knocking out electricity supplies in some cities. For more live updates from the Russia-Ukraine war, head over to our live blog: ConservativeHome editor and former Tory MP, Paul Goodman, has said some Conservative backbenchers are considering pushing for Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt to replace Liz Truss as prime minister. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme, Goodman said: All sorts of different people are talking about all sorts of different things because the Conservative backbenchers are casting around for a possible replacement for Kwasi Kwarteng, even for a possible replacement for Liz Truss. All sorts of names are being thrown about, Rishi Sunak, even Boris Johnson, Kit Malthouse, Sajid Javid. One idea “doing the rounds” is for Penny Mordaunt and Rishi Sunak to “come to some kind of arrangement and essentially take over”, Goodman added. The pair are popular as between them they got “pretty much two-thirds of the votes of MPs”, he said. Asked if this would be decided without the party members, he replied: Yes, I suppose the arrangement would be to come to an agreement about one candidate so the members are a cut-out. I have to say I’m not very enthusiastic about this kind of idea myself, nor am I enthusiastic about the prospects of the Conservative Party junking what would be its fourth leader in seven years. Belfast is the place to be this week, underlining renewed efforts to find a settlement on the Northern Ireland protocol issue. On Monday, it was the Northern Ireland secretary and minister Chris Heaton-Harris and Steve Baker. US state secretary Antony Blinken’s special adviser Derek Chollet was also there. On Wednesday it was Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney’s turn. Today a seven-member trade delegation from the European parliament will hold talks with civil society and the Business Brexit Working Group and party representatives. The delegation is made up of MEPs Nathalie Loiseau (France), Bernd Lange and Sven Simon (Germany) Seán Kelly and Barry Andrews (Ireland), Inma Rodriguez Pinero (Spain) and Ernő Schaller-Baross (Hungary). Kelly said: It is essential that we hear the issues of most concern to people and businesses first-hand. These are the people that will need to live with, and accept, the Northern Ireland Protocol. Their voices must be heard in the outcome of any agreed solution between the EU and the UK. I am particularly conscious that without an Assembly formed, Northern Ireland is somewhat lacking a clear voice on these issues, which is unfair and regretful. Liz Truss is facing a rebellion from Jacob Rees-Mogg’s business department over plans to ban solar power from most of England’s farmland. The prime minister and her environment secretary, Ranil Jayawardena, want to ban solar from about 41% of the land area of England, or about 58% of agricultural land, the Guardian revealed earlier this week. But her business secretary, Rees-Mogg, is understood to believe it is “unconservative” to tell farmers what they can and cannot do with their land. Her climate minister, Graham Stuart, said on Wednesday he would be speaking to Defra about the plans as more ground-mount solar is needed to meet renewable energy targets. In a piece for the Guardian, Rees-Mogg, who has previously decried “climate alarmism”, insists he is convinced by the need to boost renewable energy. He also reveals new policies including loosening regulations for businesses to put solar power in place and giving homeowners grants to install panels on their houses. In the piece, he says he is “not a green energy sceptic”, adding that his department would give “unprecedented support” to renewable energy sources. Rees-Mogg also brands coalmines and oil rigs as “dark satanic mills”, vowing to replace them with windfarms. On solar, he adds: We are exploring options to support low-cost finance to help householders with the upfront costs of solar installation, permitted development rights to support deployment of more small-scale solar in commercial settings and designing performance standards to further encourage renewables, including solar PV, in new homes and buildings. Read the full piece by Jacob Rees-Mogg here: Here are some more lines from James Cleverly’s morning interview round. Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said removing Liz Truss as prime minister would be a “disastrously bad idea” and only worsen market turmoil. The PM deserves support to push through her economic growth plan, he said: We have got to recognise that we do need to bring certainty to the markets. I think that changing the leadership would be a disastrously bad idea, not just politically but also economically. He acknowledged that recent turmoil in the financial markets was linked to the mini-budget, but argued “many of the challenges we are facing are challenges shared by countries around the world”. He defended the decision by the chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, to scrap the planned rise in corporation tax in his controversial mini-budget: I think that it is absolutely right that we want to invest in businesses. It is absolutely right that we help them stay competitive, we help them stay afloat. We have got to make sure we can compete internationally with the other places businesses can choose to locate. We have got to make sure we are tax-competitive. He declined to rule out further U-turns but insisted the government should “absolutely” stick with Kwarteng’s budget: Ultimately, what that mini-budget was about was protecting tens of millions of people from unaffordable energy prices. That was the bulk of that proposal. It was about making sure that taxes for 30 million people were reduced a little bit and those are really strong principles. I think we should absolutely stick with those. He said the planned statement by the chancellor on 31 October will set out a more “holistic” view of the government’s plans, but the “foundations” of the mini-budget were “really key for the growth agenda the prime minister has put forward”. The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said the government will be making “professional and tough decisions” on public spending. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: There are always areas of public expenditure where we can make sure that the growth doesn’t outmatch the growth in economy. Defence is going to grow to 3% of GDP. That is above inflation growth. That is committed to. There are other areas where we are going to have to keep it much closer to inflationary growth, but the Prime Minister said we are not going to be cutting public services. We are going to be making professional and tough decisions and we are going to grow the economy because the economic growth is going to be the thing that unlocks all those options for us. They are not mutually exclusive. He added that people should not have been surprised by Liz Truss’s plans for growth which formed the basis of Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget. The PM had “said she would protect people and businesses who were facing an unprecedented increase in their energy bills”, Cleverly said: That is what she said she would do. That is what she is doing. The fact that that seems to have taken some people by surprise is not her fault. We are going to stick with the plan. The plan is to grow the economy. Good morning. Liz Truss is facing intense pressure from within her own Conservative party to abandon her economic plan following a market backlash to the measures. The prime minister’s leadership is in fresh peril with calls growing among senior Tories to reverse more proposed tax cuts and MPs accusing her of “trashing” Conservative values. The PM’s allies rallied around her after she endured a bruising appearance at a meeting of her backbenchers on Wednesday evening. MPs described her performance as “just appalling” and raised serious concerns about mortgage rates and polls showing a hefty Labour lead. At a meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee, the chair of the education select committee, Robert Halfon, told Truss she had “trashed the last 10 years of workers’ Conservatism”. One MP later described the atmosphere as “funereal” and another described the situation as impossible. But foreign secretary, James Cleverly, came to her defence this morning, arguing that getting rid of Truss as prime minister would be a “disastrously bad idea”. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Cleverly said the government needed to do things that would “bring certainty to the markets”. He acknowledged that recent turmoil in the financial markets was linked to the mini-budget, but argued “many of the challenges we are facing are challenges shared by countries around the world”. Cleverly said: I think changing the leadership would be a disastrously bad idea politically and also economically. We are absolutely going to stay focused on growing the economy. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning. Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill - second reading. 2pm.

He imagines the great things that could happen by 2040, when his daughter will be a young woman. Gameau is clearly concerned to move his rhetoric away from anything righteously angry or confrontational – he doesn’t, for example, insist on immediate veganism, just a progressive lessening of meat-eating – and gives us an easygoing can-do approach in which there is no great emphasis on sacrifice and not even any obvious sense of emergency. Sometimes this gives the film a slightly naive apolitical flavour, with repeated, cutesy vox pops from kids about how they want the world to be a nicer place; and occasionally, the film itself treats its audiences like a class of primary schoolkids. But more often there is something likable and practical about what Gameau is proposing. He talks about solar power, and how it can enable householders and communities to donate or sell excess power to create micro-grids of electricity. He imagines a world in which car ownership will go the way of owning films on videocassette or DVD, and travel will be about leasing or using driverless electric cars and an expansion of public transport. He talks about new farming models that can capture or sequester carbon in the atmosphere and about new approaches to the cultivation of seaweed to promote marine biodiversity. In the larger sphere, he wonders aloud about greater education of women, which will mean their having fewer babies later, thus reducing pressure on resources. The focus on what individuals can do right now is attractive. • 2040 is released in the UK on 8 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2021/nov/23/carmarthenshire-west-wales-llandeilo-laugharne-ferrytown","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-23T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Brooding beauty: why Carmarthenshire is Wales’ best-kept secret","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/nov/23/carmarthenshire-west-wales-llandeilo-laugharne-ferrytown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2021/nov/23/carmarthenshire-west-wales-llandeilo-laugharne-ferrytown","fields":{"headline":"Brooding beauty: why Carmarthenshire is Wales’ best-kept secret","bodyText":"Thank God no boozy poet or philandering painter was born or buried in Llandeilo in the heart of Carmarthenshire. If there were, it would probably be flooded with pilgrims. As it is, the small inland town on the mighty Tywy (or Towy) – the longest river that has its source and outlet in Wales – has a degree of quaintness, but not too much, and only a handful of gawpers admiring the pastel-painted facades. Most are, like me, on road trips, as the A40 which runs through Llandeilo is a greenery-fringed alternative to the busier Heads of the Valleys road just to the south, and there are coffees and buns and bowls of cawl (a local lamb and veg stew) to be had here. Carmarthenshire – or Sir Gâr – known as the Garden of Wales, is one of the 13 historic counties. Still largely agricultural, it’s criss-crossed by quiet back roads and is where the M4 runs out. It’s one of many places in Wales people pass through without stopping and is something of a Cinderella county. But the shiny English SUVs dashing for the beaches of Pembrokeshire are missing out. Close to Llandeilo is the Black Mountain range at the western end of the Brecon Beacons; here the national park is taken up by the 300 square-mile Fforest Fawr Geopark, which contains mountains and moorland, woods, meadows, towns and villages and some small lakes. Beloved of locals but attracting nothing like the numbers who clamber around the likes of Pen y Fan, the peaks here are a little lower and smoother; the sense is of great age and a brooding, sombre calm. I spend a glorious half-day on an eight-mile hike from the village of Llanddeusant, which takes me up past a trout hatchery and weir, then on to a steeper path along a ridge above the glacial lake of Llyn y Fan Fach. The terrain is semi-rugged but not at all technical. A brisk breeze ships in weather and the temperature dips, but this is more than compensated for by the dance of clouds over pale-green slopes. The route continues via Picws Du; this peak, along with neighbouring Fan Foel, are the highest in the area, and while they rise only to 730 metres-plus (2,400 feet), they look much loftier due to their dramatic contours. There’s a bronze age barrow at the top of Picws Du, from where I can see back to the Cambrian Mountains and south to Swansea and the silvery shimmer of the Bristol Channel. From here it’s down to Llyn y Fan Fawr, another, slightly larger lake surrounded by peaty land, where I swing back to the starting point. One of the reasons I like South Wales is that its open spaces abut industrial and post-industrial landscapes. The better-known and perhaps rougher-looking areas are around Merthyr and down by Port Talbot, but the Carmarthenshire coast played its own part in Wales’ gritty recent history. I ditch the car to start a coastal jaunt at Llanelli, which looks out at the gorgeous Gower, but is all the things that the picturesque peninsula is not. Once known as “Tinopolis”, it used to produce huge quantities of tin and tin-plate, as well as coal. A westbound walk along the Wales Coast Path (WCP), from the bridge that crosses the tidal waters and treacherous mudflats of the River Loughor, takes in views of the Tata-owned Trostre steelworks, the twittering edges of a Wildfowl and Wetland Trust nature reserve, the former heavy industry hub of North Dock – overlooked by a Grade II-listed former hydraulic accumulator tower built around the 1900s – as well as patches of brownfield, marsh and scrub. In front of Llanelli’s Furnace Theatre, in town, a monument called Industrial Symphony honours male and female workers; the title could be used equally for the mix of landscapes. It’s a little over 18 miles from Llanelli and Ferryside. Most of it is flat and there’s plenty on the way to look at. The Gower is always there, of course, pretty and pastoral in the haze, or drizzle. Closer by, Burry Port is where Amelia Earhart and her co-pilot and mechanic touched down in 1928 after crossing the Atlantic. Stretches of sand dune, salt marsh and old military installations lead to the verdant parkland and pine forest at Pembrey country park. At Kidwelly I head inland and up a little to admire the imposing walls of the Norman castle. Ferryside is one of Carmarthen’s best-kept secrets. It faces on to one of the many estuaries that cut deep into the coast and over to Llansteffan and another castle. A community-based tourism project has made it the natural place to break a long walk. In 2015, seeing no one in officialdom helping to put Ferryside on the map, 10 trustees took out a 99-year lease on a disused ex-county council building. First they opened the lovely Pryd o Fwyd (A bite to eat) cafe and, in summer, they opened a new five-room hotel, Calon y Ferri. A post office, art gallery, restaurant and “Men’s Shed” share the same space. Locals still know the building, which has solar power, as The Billets in reference to an RAF air/sea rescue base that used to occupy the site. Ferryside is an unmanned stop on the main London/Cardiff-Milford Haven/Pembroke line – just in case you want to speed up your walking. Founded by the Romans, Carmarthen has never received the kind of attention that York and Chester, or even Peterborough have enjoyed – because it’s in Wales. Chosen because of the Tywi and its raised position, the city of Moridunum had public baths and a temple. Fought over by the Normans and Welsh princes in medieval times, it was here that Henry VII’s father, Edmund Tudor (a family of Welsh origin), died from the bubonic plague in 1456 during the War of the Roses. This tussling for power is a reminder that the so-called Landsker line – the once-fortified division between Anglophone and Welsh-speaking Wales – passes close to here. I heard plenty of Welsh spoken in the lovely little market. There’s plenty of good picnic grub and pubs here, but I had lunch out at one of my favourite places not only in Wales but in the UK: Wrights Food Emporium, in Llanarthne – 8.5 miles east of the town centre – which has successfully reinvented itself post-Covid-19 as an outdoor eatery with a limited but lovely menu of pork rillettes and chicken cooked in perry. Just nine miles away is the National Botanic Gardens of Wales. As well as a Norman Foster-designed glasshouse (toasty in the cold months), it recently concluded the Regency Restoration project – a community-led £7m scheme to return the site to its position, 200 years ago, as one of the UK’s finest waterparks. The five-year project, which included a large lake, waterfall, cascades, bridges and a dam set in 300 acres of wooded parkland, has just been nominated for a prestigious ICE People’s Choice engineering award. Carmarthenshire has intriguing horticultural and herbal connections. A bed in the Apothecary’s Garden contains plants that might have been used by the “Physicians of Myddfai”. Folk legend has it that, in the 12th or 13th century, Rhiwallon and his three sons dispensed natural remedies and started a line of doctors that lasted till the 18th century. Flukily, one of the tales relates how the family received their initial commission from a mysterious lady of the lake – and the lake was Llyn y Fan Fach, which I had skirted two days earlier. Today, Prince Charles, who has a house at nearby Llwynywermod, keeps up the local tradition with his Duchy plant extracts and his homeopathic leanings. Laugharne, 13 miles south-west of the county town, is Carmarthenshire’s one truly famous township – thanks to its boozy poet (Dylan Thomas) and, to a lesser extent, its philandering painter (Augustus John, a frequent visitor). It is possessed of a natural beauty that still stuns me – I lived there for three years – thanks to a glistening estuary, skeletal castle ruin and lovely sloping main street of Georgian houses. Visitors from all around the world come here to see the former homes and the grave of the poet. His descriptions of Laugharne as the “strangest town in Wales” and his evocations of its “heron-priested shore” are earworms for local residents, but Laugharne has survived Thomas as much as it has memorialised him; it has its own poetry, thanks to the people, the topography, the enduring remoteness. As well as the obvious pleasures of enjoying a pint in Brown’s (an old pub turned boutique hotel), the so-called Birthday Walk (after a Thomas poem) up to Sir John’s Hill is a joy; from the top of the headland there are views over to Worms Head on the Gower and to the white silken beach of Cefn Sidan – places I passed on my coastal hike. For many, such a prospect would be a natural conclusion to a Carmarthenshire tour, but I preferred to wind up the trip on Pendine Sands. This seaside resort – all chalets, fish and chips and windbreaks – is understated, and underrated, in the way Tenby and Saundersfoot, a few miles to the west, are not. But the beach is a remarkable seven-miles long and, at high tide, gapingly wide strand. Used for numerous attempts to break the land speed record and for the Welsh TT in years gone by, it’s now a great empty beauty, too windy and exposed for delicate folk. After a bracing walk back into the cooling westerly, I find a cuppa at the top of the coast path walkway set into the cliffside. If Pembrokeshire is Little England, then perhaps Carmarthenshire is Little Wales: a patchwork of all the key elements, untainted by tourism. Let the smart SUVs roll on by; this is as good as anywhere. All the coastal sections can be undertaken without a car; trains and buses connect all points. Good buses connect Carmarthen with Llanarthne/Wrights Food Emporium. For the Black Mountain range and National Botanic Gardens of Wales, local taxis are your best bet Chris Moss is the author of Wales Coast Path: Tenby-Swansea (Aurum Press) • This article was amended on 23 November 2021 to remove a mention of the Cambrian period in relation to the Llandeilo area."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/jul/23/sydney-auditors-still-licensed-in-australia-after-being-banned-in-us-over-work-on-renewables-firm","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-23T07:01:17Z","webTitle":"Sydney auditors still licensed in Australia after being banned in US over work on renewables firm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jul/23/sydney-auditors-still-licensed-in-australia-after-being-banned-in-us-over-work-on-renewables-firm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/jul/23/sydney-auditors-still-licensed-in-australia-after-being-banned-in-us-over-work-on-renewables-firm","fields":{"headline":"Sydney auditors still licensed in Australia after being banned in US over work on renewables firm","bodyText":"Two Sydney auditors who US authorities banned over their work on a renewable energy company have retained their licences to practise in Australia. The US public company accounting oversight board (PCAOB) last month banned Darryl Swindells, Aidan Smith and the firm they work for, HLB Mann Judd, over audits of BlueNRGY Group covering the years 2012 to 2017. BlueNRGY was a solar power business that at one point held the franchise to use the Westinghouse brand. The former deputy prime minister and National party leader Mark Vaile was chairman of the company, under its old name of CBD Energy, between 2008 and January 2013. There is no suggestion Vaile has done anything wrong and he could not be reached for comment. Swindells and HLB Mann Judd may reapply for registration after three years and Smith after one, but a spokeswoman for the firm said it had no intention of doing any more work in the US. The board handed out its bans on 29 June but on Wednesday afternoon Swindells and Smith were still listed as registered auditors by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. “We’re aware of the PCAOB findings and the penalties imposed,” an Asic spokesman said. “We are still reviewing the matter and cannot comment further at this time.” Swindells and Smith did not respond to Guardian Australia’s detailed questions about the case. However, a spokeswoman for HLB Mann Judd confirmed the board’s ruling related to the firm’s audits of BlueNRGY. She said that the board inspected the firm in 2018 as part of a “routine review of audits”. “HLB Mann Judd cooperated fully with this inspection and was disappointed that the PCAOB decided to take further action,” she said. “HLB Mann Judd has a team of experienced and highly qualified auditors and takes its responsibilities, both to clients and to the appropriate regulatory authorities, very seriously. “Whilst the firm had a defence against the allegations made by the PCAOB, HLB Mann Judd chose to reach a settlement on a ‘no admit/no deny’ basis.” She said the firm had paid fines totalling US$75,000 imposed on it by the board and had “no intention of carrying out any further US audit work”. “The firm has made Asic aware of the order issued by the PCAOB.” HLB was required to be registered with US authorities because BlueNRGY was at one time listed on the American Nasdaq exchange. The firm re-audited BlueNRGY’s 2012 and 2013 accounts after the previous auditors, PwC, resigned. The PCAOB alleged Swindells failed to properly consider the differences between Australian and US audit standards. Other failures include not properly assessing the risk of fraud in the 2015 and 2017 audits and failure to properly test revenue in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, the board said. It alleged Smith failed to properly assess the value of goodwill in the business in the 2017 audit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2020/dec/11/ultimate-grey-and-illuminating-pantones-2021-colours-of-the-year-spark-hope-and-despair","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-11T00:55:03Z","webTitle":"Ultimate Grey and Illuminating: Pantone's 2021 colours of the year spark hope and despair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/dec/11/ultimate-grey-and-illuminating-pantones-2021-colours-of-the-year-spark-hope-and-despair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2020/dec/11/ultimate-grey-and-illuminating-pantones-2021-colours-of-the-year-spark-hope-and-despair","fields":{"headline":"Ultimate Grey and Illuminating: Pantone's 2021 colours of the year spark hope and despair","bodyText":"In 2020 Pantone’s colour of the year choice, Classic Blue, proved eerily prescient. Announced weeks before the first Covid-19 cluster was discovered, it is a shade used for medical scrubs around the globe. Perhaps knowing that lightning is unlikely to strike twice, for 2021 the US-paint brand’s team of trend forecasters have selected two shades – Ultimate Grey and Illuminating – the second time they have done so in the Colour of the Year’s two decade history. Used by fashion, graphic and interior designers, the Pantone Institute’s colour matching services are a resource for predicting palettes that might prove popular with consumers. Their colour of the year choices are often contentious. This year, the combination has been likened to the shades of hi-vis vests, road markings and “screaming sickly urban melancholy, a brutalist facade, cold sunshine and cement”. Vogue described it simply as “really weird”. Pantone say their choices this year as “a message of happiness supported by fortitude”. But darker readings of Ultimate Grey, a pale shade of dove they liken to “pebbles on the beach and natural elements” aren’t hard to come by. The track pants we’ve all been pulling on each morning; the sameness of days blurring into one another; the vinyl floors of an ICU ward. Their second choice Illuminating is a buttercup yellow, which Pantone describe as “bright and cheerful”; “sparkling with vivacity” and “imbued with solar power”. It is the first time in over a decade a shade of yellow has been chosen. In 2009, when they selected a warmer yellow, Mimosa, they said “no other colour expresses hope and reassurance more than yellow”. A lot may have changed in 10 years, but it seems Pantone’s interpretation of yellow has not. Speaking with Vogue, Pantone’s trend forecasters explained they selected two colours because, “it became apparent that there was never going to be one colour that could express everything that needed to be expressed — that it was, instead, critical to have two independent colours that could come together.” Back in 2016, when they selected Rose Quartz a shade that became more popularly known as Millennial Pink; paired with a soft blue Serenity, the dual choice represented “wellness” and “movements toward gender equality and fluidity”. Pantone’s Colour of the Year choices often make a social statement – the climate crisis was a clear leaping-off point for 2019’s choice Living Coral and 2017’s shade Greenery. In September this year, the paint brand also launched a vibrant shade of red Period in a bid to end stigmas around menstruation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2021/mar/04/biden-energy-department-loan-program","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-03-04T13:49:59Z","webTitle":"Biden’s energy department revives loan program to boost clean technology","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/04/biden-energy-department-loan-program","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/mar/04/biden-energy-department-loan-program","fields":{"headline":"Biden’s energy department revives loan program to boost clean technology","bodyText":"As part of its clean-energy agenda, the Biden administration is reviving an energy department program that disbursed billions of dollars in loan guarantees to companies such as electric car maker Tesla and the failed solar company Solyndra, the energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, says. The loan program helped launch the country’s first utility-scale wind and solar farms as part of the Obama administration’s efforts to create “green jobs” but largely went dormant under Donald Trump. The program boosted Tesla’s efforts to become a behemoth in electric cars, but it stumbled with a major loan guarantee to Solyndra, the California solar company that failed soon after receiving federal money a decade ago, costing taxpayers more than $500m. Republicans and other critics cite Solyndra as an example of wasteful spending under Barack Obama’s stimulus program, and the loan guarantees have largely dried up in recent years. The energy department provided $12bn in guarantees for the Vogtle nuclear power station in Georgia, but few other loans were offered under Trump. When running for office, Joe Biden put forth a $2tn plan to eliminate all greenhouse gas emissions from the US electricity grid within 15 years, a goal that was applauded by climate campaigners but was criticized for the enormous overhaul it will require. The restart of the energy department’s loan program – which was once a major tool the federal government had to incentivize clean energy innovation – gives the Biden administration a chance to redeem it after Solyndra’s fall. Granholm said up to $40bn in guarantees will be made available for a variety of clean-energy projects, including wind, solar and hydro power, advanced vehicles, geothermal and even nuclear. “It’s got to be clean. That’s it,” she said. “And when I say clean, you know, it’s technologies that are being researched in the lab,” like projects to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions, so-called green hydrogen fuel and other energy sources, she said. The program will be overseen by Jigar Shah, a longtime clean-energy entrepreneur who helped pioneer solar power in the US. Shah told Bloomberg News that his leading the program will “make it more accessible and make entrepreneurs feel like someone who has been in their shoes before is there and will give them a fair hearing.” While Republicans are likely to focus on avoiding a repeat of Solyndra, Granholm, a former Michigan governor, said Tesla is a better example. The company’s founder, Elon Musk, repaid the loan in full years ahead of schedule and Tesla is now one of the world’s leading makers of electric cars and battery storage. “I mean, obviously that was two administrations ago,” she said, referring to Solyndra, which went bankrupt in 2011. “We’ve learned a lot since then. People understand that when you invest in technology that is new, you’re going to have some that don’t succeed.” Still, the loan program overall has returned more than $500m to taxpayers, “people paying back their loans with interest”, Granholm said. On other topics, Granholm said she thinks electric utilities can reach Biden’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035. The head of a utility lobbying group said last month that the 2035 date would be “an incredibly difficult situation to handle” for most US electricity providers. Getting to 80% or 90% of clean electricity is “doable”, she said. “And the last bit is going to be harder, but we have to do it.” The good news is that companies have time to make the transition and improve the technology needed produce clean power at a larger scale, she said. Granholm also pledged that the energy department would be part of Biden’s commitment to environmental justice. Shalanda Baker, deputy director for energy justice and Granholm’s equity adviser, will lead the effort, targeting disadvantaged communities that have lost jobs in coal mines or power plants or are located near refineries, incinerators or other hazards. Biden has pledged that 40% of the benefits of clean-energy investments will go to disadvantaged communities, “so that they are not forgotten, not unseen”, Granholm said. Granholm, who took office 25 February after being confirmed by the Senate, said her first week on the job “has been an amazing, under-the-firehose learning experience”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/apr/06/new-renewable-energy-capacity-hit-record-levels-in-2019","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-06T15:41:14Z","webTitle":"New renewable energy capacity hit record levels in 2019","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/06/new-renewable-energy-capacity-hit-record-levels-in-2019","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/apr/06/new-renewable-energy-capacity-hit-record-levels-in-2019","fields":{"headline":"New renewable energy capacity hit record levels in 2019","bodyText":"Almost three-quarters of new electricity generation capacity built in 2019 uses renewable energy, representing an all-time record. New data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) shows solar, wind and other green technologies now provide more than one-third of the world’s power, marking another record. Fossil fuel power plants are in decline in Europe and the US, with more decommissioned than built in 2019. But the number of coal and gas plants grew in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In the Middle East, which owns half the world’s oil reserves, just 26% of new electricity generation capacity built in 2019 was renewable. The world has invested about $3tn in renewables over the past decade, according to Irena, but annual investments must double by 2030 to tackle the climate emergency. “While the trajectory is positive, more is required to put global energy on a path with sustainable development and climate mitigation,” said Francesco La Camera, director general of Irena. “At this challenging time, we are reminded of the importance of building resilience into our economies.” La Camera said the huge spending planned by governments in response to the coronavirus pandemic must support green initiatives rather than fossil fuels. “In responding to today’s crisis, governments may be tempted to focus on short-term solutions,” he said. “Yet distinctions between short-, medium- and long-term challenges may be deceptive. The pandemic shows that delayed action brings significant economic consequences.” The global oil market is in turmoil, hit by collapsing demand due to Covid-19 lockdowns and a savage price war between Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US. La Camera said: “Renewable energy is a cost-effective source of new power that insulates power markets and consumers from volatility.” Solar and wind power are now the cheapest form of electricity in two-thirds of the world. The Irena data shows the increase in new renewable energy capacity slowed slightly in 2019 - from 179GW to 176GW – but that new fossil fuel power also fell. The total green energy installed to date around the world grew by 7.6%, with the UK’s total rising 6.1%. The UK is now 11th in the world for installed renewables. New solar power provided 55% of the new capacity, most of which was installed in Asia, with China, India, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam leading the way. Other major increases were seen in the US, Australia, Spain, Germany and Ukraine. Wind power made up 34% of the total, with almost half in China and significant additions in the US. Global wind power capacity remains just ahead of solar, with 95% being onshore turbines. Other green technologies – hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal and marine energy – all grew modestly year-on-year. While small compared with solar and wind power, geothermal energy – tapping the heat of deep rocks – is growing, with Turkey, Indonesia and Kenya leading the way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2020/aug/20/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2020-08-20T20:00:30Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/aug/20/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2020/aug/20/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• An article said that “181 NHS staff have died of Covid-19 in England”, attributing this figure to the charity Full Fact.

But though Russia’s president Vladimir Putin insisted he was “genuinely interested in galvanising international cooperation so as to look further for effective solutions to climate change as well as to all other vital challenges”, he made no mention of reducing oil and gas supply or consumption. Putin also failed to provide any assurance that Russia would submit a new national plan on cutting carbon, a requirement this year under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Russia’s greenhouse gas emissions have risen strongly in recent years, and its status as one of the world’s biggest fossil fuel suppliers has been bolstered by a deal to supply gas to Germany, and could be strengthened still further if Putin’s attempts to drill under and find shipping lines through the shrinking Arctic ice cap are successful. Paul Bledsoe, a former US government climate official and now a consultant in Washington, said: “Russia is a climate criminal. Its emissions are out of control, growing faster than any other major emitters in the last few years, and Putin seems to want to make Russia’s oil and gas his personal fiefdom. Russia is a complete outlier in climate terms.” Putin’s presence at the White House virtual climate summit, which took place on Thursday and Friday, was because “he fancies himself as a global leader, but he stuck out like a sore thumb”, said Bledsoe. Russia was not the only country regarded as a climate villain to attend the summit. King Salman of Saudi Arabia told other world leaders: “Enhancing the level of international cooperation is the optimal solution to meeting the challenges of climate change.” But though the world’s largest oil producer has committed to meeting half of its own energy needs through solar power and other renewable sources by 2030, and crown prince Mohammed bin Salman received praise for his plans to plant 50bn trees, King Salman made no mention of reducing oil exports. Saudi Arabia has a history of obstructing agreement at successive UN climate conferences in the past three decades. As the world prepares for vital UN climate talks, called Cop26, later this year, diplomats are hoping that the pressure from the rest of the world can overcome any such attempts this time. Bledsoe warned: “Saudi was up to its usual tricks [at the White House summit]. They murmur pleasant things but then try to undermine consensus at every major juncture. We can look for them to play the same kind of blocking attempts at Cop26.” Oil producers were not the only countries with a difficult track record on climate to be courted by Biden. Brazil prevented agreement at the last UN climate conference, called Cop25 in December 2019, and president Jair Bolsonaro has overseen a return to the widespread destruction of the Amazon that is close to irreversible. At the White House summit, Bolsonaro insisted Brazil was intent on protecting the Amazon and repeated his goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. He vowed to end illegal deforestation by 2030, and double funding for enforcement, and said his efforts would result in a halving of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Few green campaigners believed him. Leila Salazar-Lopez, executive director of Amazon Watch, said: “Bolsonaro once again lied to the international community. He said he strengthened regulatory bodies to protect the environment, when in fact he weakened them. Environmental regulations have been systematically rolled back and the rates of deforestation have tripled.” Sarah duPont, president of the Amazon Aid Foundation, added: “Brazil’s promises made during the summit are considered insincere and met with great suspicion. Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon has soared. Many of Bolsonaro’s new, as well as possible future, policies relax regulations around illegal deforestation and the protections of indigenous people. The expression ‘watch what they do, not what they say’ is appropriate in this case.” Bolsonaro is in talks with the Biden administration and with the UK, as host and president of Cop26, over a potential deal that could see some measure of protection for the rainforest in return for billions. Critics regard the potential deal as appeasement. Australia also used the summit to showcase its leader’s climate credentials, but omitted to make any new commitments. Scott Morrison, prime minister, said future generations would “thank us not for what we have promised, but what we deliver” and praised the country’s efforts to increase renewable energy and investments in “priority new technology solutions”. However, he failed to commit to the net zero emissions by the 2050 target that scientists say is necessary to hold global heating within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels, and which countries responsible for two-thirds of global emissions have now espoused. He also failed to make any new commitments to reduce emissions in the next decade, which was the main point of the US summit and will be crucial to the success of Cop26 later this year. Kevin Rudd, former prime minister of Australia, and president of the Asia Society, said: “The fact that the US’ target is almost twice as ambitious as Australia’s, and the UK’s is three times as much, shows just how isolated we have become.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/apr/23/the-us-climate-target-blows-australias-out-of-the-water","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-22T23:18:12Z","webTitle":"The US climate target blows Australia's out of the water | Frank Jotzo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/23/the-us-climate-target-blows-australias-out-of-the-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/23/the-us-climate-target-blows-australias-out-of-the-water","fields":{"headline":"The US climate target blows Australia’s out of the water","bodyText":"The US climate target for 2030 blows Australia’s out of the water. Together with dramatically strengthened targets by several other major countries, it resets expectations. And it puts big pressure on Australia to lift our game. If we don’t, we will be seen in the ranks of countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia and Brazil. If we do, it will help position the economy for the future. The US has now pledged to cut emissions by 50% to 52% by 2030 relative to 2005. In 2019, US emissions were just 13% below 2005 levels. The target is far stronger than most would have thought possible not long ago. To achieve, it would require deep change across the US economy, with comprehensive policies from both federal administration and the states, and rapid action by investors. The UK target is a 78% reduction relative to 1990 by 2035, and the EU 55% at 2030. Japan is expected to ramp up its 2030 target to a 46% cut relative to 2013. Canada’s was increased to 40%-45%, up from 30%. These targets represent the kind of ambition required everywhere to effectively limit climate change. Delivering them will need strong policies. Australia’s 2030 target of a 26%-28% reduction has always been quite weak compared with most other developed countries’ targets. It was meant to be ratcheted up, like all Paris agreement pledges. Now it is totally inadequate compared with those by our best friends and allies. The commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 is important, but it needs to be underpinned by a realistic strategy, meaningful mid-term goals, and immediate measures. Australia’s national emissions were 14% below 2005 levels in 2019 and about 19% lower in 2020, in part due to Covid. Reductions in land clearing mostly achieved before 2013 account for the entire aggregate reduction. Emissions of all other sources combined have actually increased since 2005, with a flat trend over the past five years. We can easily do so much better. Emissions from electricity generation are gradually declining as ever cheaper wind and solar power displaces coal. Policy could and should accelerate the shift towards clean power. Part of that is more predictable and orderly closure of the coal plants, allowing timely replacement investment and support programs in the regions. There is no meaningful effort to lower emissions from fuel use in industry, transport, mining and oil and gas production, which account for more than half of Australia’s greenhouse gas footprint. It would be effective and economically sensible to put a price on emissions in industry and mining. It would be beneficial to have a minimum efficiency standards for cars and to encourage the uptake of electric cars, like most developed countries do. There are no effective emissions policies in agriculture except government payments to some projects that aim to cut emissions. Slogans like “technology not taxes” do not cut it internationally. The Biden administration has already sent a blunt message to Australia that more than technology support is needed in Australia. And the many governments that successfully run emissions markets will shake their heads. The funding announced this week for regional hydrogen hubs and international collaborations on low-emissions energy are positive steps. But they are small given the magnitude of the challenge and the opportunity, and not even a figleaf in the absence of actual policy. Some of the money is for carbon capture and storage, while the large-scale clean energy export industries of the future will ultimately run on zero-emissions energy. Australia’s climate policy has been plagued by party politics. This needs to change. International pressure could help what has seemed impossible in Canberra. Australia will be expected to take on a much stronger 2030 target and to underpin it with policies and measures across the economy. Our allies will not take “maybe later” or reminders that we “meet and beat” our previous soft Kyoto targets for an answer. Secretary of state Antony Blinken has said that any country not pulling its weight on emissions “will hear from us”. Europe meanwhile is primed to levy carbon penalties on imports from countries without proper emissions measures. As a political pragmatist, Morrison should reposition his government. The ever-louder calls for sensible climate policy by much of the business and finance community will help with that. Scaremongering about the costs of action will lose its political appeal. Expect the government’s policy position to gradually soften. Perhaps the door will be left open for climate policy measures after the election. This in turn would widen the Labor party’s political room to manoeuvre on climate policy, with its new emphasis on the economic upside. With any luck, the political contest over climate change will be more and more over what to do and how best to do it. That would be the starting point for sounder policy whoever is in power, and the beginning of healing after a decade lost to adversarial politics. The crux of the matter is that decarbonising means making Australia’s economy fit for the low-emissions future that the world is embarking on. Locking into the high-pollution model of the 20th century is no recipe for prosperity. We need to genuinely push towards net zero, starting now, using this continent’s zero-carbon energy advantage. • Frank Jotzo is a professor at the ANU Crawford School of Public Policy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2021/feb/04/modern-nomads-nomadland-van-life-us-public-lands","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2021-02-04T10:00:32Z","webTitle":"Off-road, off-grid: the modern nomads wandering America's back country","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/feb/04/modern-nomads-nomadland-van-life-us-public-lands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2021/feb/04/modern-nomads-nomadland-van-life-us-public-lands","fields":{"headline":"Off-road, off-grid: the modern nomads wandering America's back country","bodyText":"If you look closely on city streets, campgrounds and stretches of desert run by the Bureau of Land Management, you’ll see more Americans living in vehicles than ever before. It was never their plan. “I wasn’t prepared when I had to move into my SUV. The transmission was going. I had no money saved. I was really scared,” said April Craren, 52, bundled in blankets atop a cot inside her new minivan, a 2003 Toyota Sienna. She flipped the camera on her phone to show me the camp stove she uses to make coffee and her view of the sun rising over the Colorado River. She has no toilet, shower or refrigeration. After separating from her husband, April found herself homeless in June 2020, exacerbating the depressive disorder for which she receives $1,100 a month in disability benefits. “I could have gotten an apartment but in a crappy unsafe place with no money to do anything at all,” she explained. Last year, where April lived in Nixa, Missouri, the average rent for an apartment was $762, slightly less than the national average. Like nearly half of American renters, she would have been crippled by the cost. It’s not surprising, then, that job loss, divorce or, say, the sudden onset of a global health or financial crisis can push so many over the edge. “If the Great Recession was a crack in the system, Covid and climate change will be the chasm,” says Bob Wells, 65, the nomad who plays himself in the film Nomadland, an early Oscar contender starring Frances McDormand. Bob helped April to adopt the nomad way of life and change her life in the process. Today, he lives exclusively on public lands in his GMC Savana fitted with 400 watts of solar power and a 12-volt refrigerator. His life mission is to promote nomadic tribalism in a car, van or RV as a way to prevent homelessness and live more sustainably. ••• Before becoming a nomad in 1995, Bob lived in Anchorage, Alaska, with his wife and two boys. He worked as a union clerk at the same Safeway where his father had worked until retirement, only to die two years later. Bob didn’t want his father’s fate, but there he was. As days became decades, he went to a job he hated, worked with people he didn’t like, to buy things he didn’t want. By his own telling, he was the living embodiment of Thoreau’s “quiet desperation”. He knew he wasn’t happy, but it never occurred to him to live differently. After all, this was the American dream, right? Then, when he was 40 years old, the divorce happened. After paying alimony and child support, he was taking home $1,200 a month, $800 of which went towards rent. One day, fretting about impossible finances, he saw a green box van for sale and thought: “Why don’t I buy that van and move into it?” The idea struck him as crazy, but with the prospect of homelessness closing in, he drained the last $1,500 in his savings account and bought the van that was just “too ratty-looking” for its previous owner. He gave his landlord notice that night, threw a sleeping pad in the back of his new home, and cried himself to sleep. Then came the first of the month, and something clicked: he didn’t have to pay rent. As his finances improved, he installed insulation, a proper bed, even a dream-come-true PlayStation fortress for his boys. He started working only 32 hours a week, and since every weekend was a three-day weekend, he spent more time camping with his kids, which “tremendously helped” his mental outlook on life. Finally, he was truly happy. Realizing he had something valuable to share, he bought the domain name Cheap RV Living in 2005. He posted tips and tricks about better vehicle-dwelling, but what he was really offering was a road map to a better life. Four years later, when close to 10 million Americans were displaced after the Great Recession, traffic to his site exploded. Finding himself at the center of a growing online community, he decided to create a meet-up in Quartzsite, Arizona. He dubbed it the Rubber Tramp Rendezvous (RTR), and in January 2011, 45 vehicles showed up. Eight years later, an estimated 10,000 vehicles convened for what was said to be the largest nomad gathering in the world. The event’s explosive growth is undoubtedly a reflection of America’s increasing interest in van life as an answer to the affordable housing crisis, an idea made accessible by Bob on his YouTube channel, also named Cheap RV Living, created in 2015. Whether he’s sharing a philosophical exploration, as in Why I Live in a Van, or explaining the mechanics of Pooping in a Car, Van, or RV, Bob’s videos are a prized free resource, making him a beloved celebrity in the nomad community. With 460,000 subscribers, the videos are also making him money via ad and affiliate sales. His most popular video, Living in a Car on $800 a month, has more than 4m views. Fame, however, isn’t Bob’s jam. He doesn’t like the term “follower” and definitely doesn’t want to be thought of as a guru. Rather, he’s driven by a quieter demon-cum-angel. After the devastating loss of his eldest son in 2011, he was plagued by despair and, for the first time, suicidal thoughts. “Why am I alive when my son isn’t?” he asked himself obsessively. With a desperate plea to a higher power, he finally found the will to bear the pain by being of service and building a community. “If I’m going to be alive, there’d better be a reason, and this is the reason. You are the reason,” he said to a crowd at the RTR in 2020, in what was published later as a video about mental illness for his online audience. The culmination of this drive to serve is the Home on Wheels Alliance (Howa), a charitable 501(c)(3) non-profit he founded in 2018. With the help of his team and volunteers, Bob helps advance clients who are being squeezed out of traditional housing from a state of crisis to financial stability to finally being contributing members of the mobile community. To date, funded by sponsors and donations, Howa has given away seven minivans, two trailers, one skoolie (a converted school bus) and too many tents, brake pads and tires to count. April had been watching Bob’s videos for years when a nomad friend online suggested she apply to Howa for assistance. “That’s really for someone more needy,” she replied. At the time, she was living in her car with the faulty transmission. “I don’t know, April, you’re pretty needy,” her friend prodded. April conceded and applied. “When I found out I was awarded the minivan, that changed everything,” she said. To join Howa’s program, April had to sign a three-year contract, prove she had sufficient income to regularly maintain her vehicle, and agree to put $200 a month in an escrow account until she reached the value of the minivan, after which the vehicle title and escrow account would be released to her. “Most of Howa’s applicants are older women. They’re disabled, or retired and divorced without sufficient SSI [supplemental security income] because they were homemakers, or simply don’t earn enough to afford rent,” Bob explained. By learning to save money and live rent-free in their vehicles, Howa’s clients preserve their independence, self-sufficiency and dignity while also making friends within the larger nomad community. ••• Today, April camps on public land alongside Cliff, a veteran nomad and Howa volunteer. Together, they make runs to a nearby laundromat, grocery store and gym where she works out and showers. She’s lost 20lb and feels healthier, thanks to eating fresh foods at Cliff’s urging and living a more active outdoor lifestyle. “I’m not just surviving, I’m thriving,” she said. After Covid, she’d like to volunteer and join a caravan, a popular program Howa organized to help nomads stay safe and fend off loneliness. Howa vets establish camping locations and then members use Meetup to learn where groups are headed. Some caravans are small, while others have gotten as big as 45 rigs. “I heard it’s like a party,” April chirped. Expecting homelessness to continue rising, in part due to climate disaster, Bob’s dream for the tribe is to see the expansion of Long-Term Visitor Land (LTVA), including areas in national forests. Most public lands allow visitors to camp for only two weeks, but LTVA campers can stay for as long as seven months. These campgrounds don’t offer hookups – most nomads use solar power, anyway – though a few do have dump stations and fresh water. “Thousands of nomads could winter in the south and summer in the forest for longer stretches of time,” he explained. While Bob concedes the limits of his solution – it doesn’t address PTSD, mental illness or drug addiction, three main causes of homelessness – he does see it as a way to lower our carbon footprint and make ourselves more financially resilient in trying times ahead. “I want to leave a world behind that’s habitable. For every person I’m able to help into a vehicle, that’s one less person in a house,” he reasoned."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2020/nov/26/british-coal-plants-fired-up-to-meet-temporary-electricity-shortfall","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-26T15:07:04Z","webTitle":"British coal plants fired up to meet temporary electricity shortfall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/26/british-coal-plants-fired-up-to-meet-temporary-electricity-shortfall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/nov/26/british-coal-plants-fired-up-to-meet-temporary-electricity-shortfall","fields":{"headline":"British coal plants fired up to meet temporary electricity shortfall","bodyText":"Britain has fired up some of its last remaining coal power plants to help keep the lights on as the country’s wind turbines slow over a few days and the demand for electricity rises. Three of the UK’s last coal power plants, operating at Drax, West Burton, and Ratcliffe, were called on to supply 6% of electricity on Thursday morning. Coal’s share of the electricity mix was roughly double the share of wind and solar power in the electricity mix, and six times the average contribution made by coal plants in the final months of last year. The coal plants are likely to keep running over the next few days, alongside a fleet of gas-fired power plants, before breezy weather returns to help meet the rising demand for electricity from renewable energy sources. The electricity system operator said that the UK still had enough electricity to meet demand, but the cushion of extra power supplies was lower than usual “owing to a number of factors” including “varying renewable generation levels and colder temperatures”. It is the third time in recent weeks that National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) has warned that energy supplies are under pressure. Tom Edwards, an energy analyst at Cornwall Insight, said the supply squeeze had caused market prices for electricity generated in the early evening, when electricity demand typically spikes, to climb to over £313 per megawatt hours (MWh). He said that renewable electricity was in relatively short supply in western Europe too, meaning the UK would need to keep running its coal plants while exporting power to France and to the Netherlands via cable interconnectors. The UK is poised for a multi-billion pound boom in renewable energy in the next 10 years, alongside big investments in energy storage technology and nuclear power to help cut fossil fuels from the energy system. SSE and the Norwegian energy firm Equinor on Thursday gave the green light to the first two phases of the world’s largest offshore windfarm, at Dogger Bank, after completing the financing for the £3bn project. The Dogger Bank windfarm is also one of the most cost competitive offshore windfarms in the world after driving its costs down to record lows of between £39.65/MWh and £41.61/MWh in the government’s support contract auction last year. Orsted, the offshore wind power company, and Shell, have agreed to buy the electricity generated by Dogger Bank when it starts operations in the middle of the decade. Orsted will take a 40% share of the electricity generated, and Shell a 20% share."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2021/nov/19/madonna-drugs-and-helicopter-trained-dogs-the-dark-starry-life-of-william-orbit","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-19T10:00:32Z","webTitle":"Madonna, drugs and helicopter-trained dogs: the dark, starry life of William Orbit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/19/madonna-drugs-and-helicopter-trained-dogs-the-dark-starry-life-of-william-orbit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2021/nov/19/madonna-drugs-and-helicopter-trained-dogs-the-dark-starry-life-of-william-orbit","fields":{"headline":"Madonna, drugs and helicopter-trained dogs: the dark, starry life of William Orbit","bodyText":"There was a point in the early 00s when William Orbit was poised to go interstellar. He was one of the great pop architects of the Y2K era, the Mark Ronson or Jack Antonoff of his day. He produced Madonna’s Grammy-sweeping Ray of Light, with its magnetic techno-lite, in 1998; Blur’s 13 a year later; and made hits for some of the biggest films around the new millennium: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle, The Next Best Thing and The Beach. The latter’s lead track, Pure Shores, recorded by the British pop group All Saints, was the second most successful UK single of 2000. Echoes of its breathy acoustica and bleepy-bloopy electronica can still be heard in the charts; it was recently championed by Lorde, who said the song was an inspiration for this year’s much anticipated album Solar Power. Occasionally, Orbit, 65, will be in his local branch of Whole Foods in Kensington, west London, and Pure Shores will waft over the speakers. These days, he will think: “Oh yeah, it’s all right this track, I get it now.” At the time, it had taken so long to make that he thought it was “pure shite. When you really slave over something, it takes years until you can really listen to it with pleasure. That or a couple of bottles of wine,” he hoots. In the 80s, Orbit had been in the synth-pop band Torch Song and started Guerilla Studios, working with some of the edgiest acts of the decade – Gary Numan, Cabaret Voltaire and Laibach among them. The following decade, he made house music as Bassomatic. But by 2000, as chillout boomed in popularity, you couldn’t move for Orbit’s ambient-pop twinkliness. Indulging his other great love, orchestral music, Orbit’s classical-electronic fusion album Pieces in a Modern Style went to No 2 in 2000, off the back of a successful remix of Samuel Barber’s Adagio for Strings by the Dutch trance DJ Ferry Corsten. Orbit was so successful that, between 2002 and 2005, he took up residence at the Leonard hotel near Hyde Park, where he recorded Bono’s vocals for U2’s song Electrical Storm. “I had some serious money and I bought a big fat house in Connaught Square and did it up – and I couldn’t bear to move in,” he says. “So the hotel that I particularly liked, I just moved in there. It was like: this is the life. This is like the Chelsea hotel [in New York], but in London.” He could have been a superproducer turned star, the UK’s Rick Rubin by way of Moby. But that didn’t quite happen. “It should have,” he nods sagely, long grey hair falling around his face. *** When we speak, Orbit is in another hotel room, in an upmarket health resort in Austria, where he has gone to “get toned up a bit”. He has pushed his body to the limit to finish his new album, his first since 2014. It is a triumphant full stop after a tough period, about which he is surprisingly candid. “I did my rock’n’roll excess thing about four years ago, when I was 61,” he says. “I waited that long. I went a bit over the top, learned my lesson. I did go a bit crazy. Drugs will do that to you., you know, if you’ve got a certain predisposition to being in the clouds, as I suppose I do …” Today, Orbit seems more down to earth. He is terrifically gossipy, in a foppish, conspiratorial way, firing off stories about working with Pink (“one of the grumpiest singers, but one of the best”), hanging out with billionaires (“they’ll be like: is your dog helicopter trained?”) and why he is considering buying a Gandalf staff (“my limbs don’t work because they’re shit”). He talks at length about Madonna, with whom he made three albums – her unique musicality, her toughness, how she is a better arranger than him – and about whom illuminating anecdotes tumble out of nowhere. “We were at the Hit Factory [studio in New York] once and I walked in on her on the lav – she hadn’t locked it,” says Orbit. “She’s doing a No 2 and I’m like: ‘Oh God, I’m so sorry.’ She said: ‘William, look, I was brought up in a family of six kids with one loo, so don’t sweat it.’” The first time they worked together, on Ray of Light, “killed me”, says Orbit. “I was in a crisis with my family, which I put on hold. I remember getting very ill that winter; at the age of 43, I was done in physically.” It took months to complete. Madonna, who was a new mum at the time, cracked the whip. As hard as it was, it was an atmosphere in which he thrived. “I flourish under that,” he says. “She’s a fabulous producer. When it says ‘produced by Madonna and William Orbit’, people don’t always give her the credit for that. But she’s as responsible as me.” After his initial string of successes, however, Orbit became a chart-pop shill for Ricky Martin, Mel C and Chris Brown (and those are just the songs that were released). “I got into this songwriting scene in America and I thought: ‘I’m not suited to this,’” he says. “The inner voice was saying: ‘You did Ray of Light, why are you doing remixes now? You should be the don.’ I didn’t listen. My inner voice got suffocated by my own misguidedness and I felt increasingly impotent to do anything about it.” He made a couple of his own albums, “but they really fell off. I didn’t get returns to my calls. It’s been yonks since I’ve made any proper statement of my own, rather than trying to do a song for some pop artist who’s got 10 other people on speed dial.” In the end, he got “more and more frustrated, believing that I was useless and washed up”. The last album he worked on with Madonna, 2012’s EDM-fuelled MDNA, was a commercial and critical failure. “It was disappointing,” says Orbit, adding that he thinks ageism had “a profound negative effect” on its reception. Britney Spears’s 2013 album Britney Jean arrived shortly afterwards. Executive-produced by will.i.am, the album received lukewarm reviews, little to no promotion and felt strangely impersonal, despite claiming to be the opposite. Orbit worked on its opening track, Alien, in which she compares herself to a lonely extraterrestrial. In light of what we now know about her conservatorship, did the album feel similarly controlled? “That end of the pop spectrum is more controlled, if you like,” says Orbit, who says that they made Alien remotely. “Here’s the difficult thing, because I’m friendly with Will and with Britney. All I’ll say is that there was a frisson there. If I work with an artist, they are the goddess, they are the boss. If I want to be the boss, I’ll make my own records. You’re here to be in the service of a true pop star – if you don’t have that attitude, you shouldn’t be in the game.” *** Eventually, Orbit took a turn for the worse. Four years ago, he moved back to England from Los Angeles and got in with a party crowd. He took up painting, but mainly cocaine. “Instead of worrying about my career, I could just be a hedonist,” he says. “I’d never done coke before and in a short space of time I’d be the guy that could do the most. And then I went to some festivals and I did LSD, mushrooms, MDMA, coke, some hormones that everybody was experimenting with. Codeine. I wasn’t aware of what I was doing and I ended up having a psychotic episode.” Even that wasn’t enough to stop him. “I cringe when I think about it. I was in a bad space, but not terminally so. Then it got to the point where I started smoking tons of weed – eight joints a day. It never agreed with me and I became manic.” As a result, last March, “I had a second breakdown”, he says. He was lying in the street, convinced he was a secret operative tasked with saving the royal family. He was sectioned. “Fortunately, once the drugs were out of my system, I finally got back to being normal – and out I was,” he says, with a what-a-wally tone. Almost as soon as he was released from psychiatric hospital, though, the first UK lockdown was announced. “I was deeply disappointed with myself and there was fucking Covid at the same time,” he says. His new manager put Orbit in touch with a rising alt-pop singer called Maeve and Orbit taught himself how to use Pro Tools on his laptop, via online tutorials, to produce some tracks. He hadn’t made any music for ages “and, bit by bit, I started to enjoy it”. Now, a new Orbit album is almost finished: “The best thing I’ve done in 20 years!” he enthuses. “You’ve caught me at a turning point. You can have a turning point at any age and this is mine.” But first there is an EP, out next month, for the electronic label Anjunadeep. It feels like what he should have made after Pieces in a Modern Style: symphonic trance crescendos, some chillout meanderings, a major ambient-rave tune. The Canadian-Colombian artist Lido Pimienta appears on vocals, hinting at the direction that his full album might take next year (guest singers aplenty). He is not worried about being an old man in a young gun’s world; he is energised to see that his sound is having a moment once more. “Ambient music has gone mainstream,” he says. “Radio 1 have got into chill – I’m doing a Wind Down mix for them. Somebody sent me a link to one of my tracks [in a video] on Instagram and it said: ‘Music for calming dogs on Bonfire Night.’” He is genuinely thrilled, fizzing with enthusiasm. “I realised that I had to grow up a bit,” he says. “I’ve just left my adolescence. It’s great being 65 – it’s easier than being 40, because you’re an old dude and you don’t have an agenda any more. It’s a young game, the pop music game. But I think there’s room for one Bill Nighy. It’s not like it’s a crowded field.” Perhaps not an agenda, but he does have hopes for his music, at least. “I want this very much – and to reinvent is very hard,” says Orbit. “When you’re young, you don’t realise this at the time, but everything is handed to you. I like a challenge. I desperately want this music to be heard. Nothing will stop me now.” • William Orbit’s Starbeam EP is released on 1 December on Anjunadeep • This article was amended on 19 November 2021. Electrical Storm is a song by U2, not an album as previously stated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2020/nov/11/rolls-royce-vows-to-create-6000-uk-jobs-with-nuclear-power-station-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-11T08:40:52Z","webTitle":"Rolls-Royce vows to create 6,000 UK jobs with nuclear power station plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/11/rolls-royce-vows-to-create-6000-uk-jobs-with-nuclear-power-station-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/nov/11/rolls-royce-vows-to-create-6000-uk-jobs-with-nuclear-power-station-plans","fields":{"headline":"Rolls-Royce vows to create 6,000 UK jobs with nuclear power station plans","bodyText":"Rolls-Royce says it can create 6,000 UK jobs within five years if the government backs its plans to build small nuclear reactors around the country. The engineering company is part of a consortium that is pushing for the government to commit billions of pounds to build 16 of the small modular reactors (SMRs) around the UK. The factory-built nuclear power stations are predicted to provide up to 440MW of electricity each, enough to power a city of 450,000 homes over a planned lifespan of 60 years. The UK SMR Consortium, which also includes the building company Laing O’Rourke and the National Nuclear Laboratory, among others, said the reactors can play a major part in the UK’s efforts to fight the climate crisis with zero direct emissions, as well as boosting UK exports. However, it faces opposition on the grounds of safety, security and cost. The consortium this week signed agreements with the US company Exelon Generation and the Czech power company CEZ to consider the reactors. Small nuclear reactors were first developed in the 1950s to use in nuclear-powered submarines. Since then Rolls-Royce has designed reactors for seven classes of submarine and two separate land-based prototype reactors. However, to be cost-effective for civilian use the power generated by the reactors has to compete with renewable sources such as wind and solar power. The costs of installing renewables have fallen dramatically in the last decade and they do not pose the same safety concerns. The Financial Times last month reported that the government was backing the plans to commit between £1.5bn and £2bn, and that it would form part of Boris Johnson’s 10-point plan for the environment. However, the second wave of coronavirus has caused the delay of the Treasury’s multiyear spending review. Proponents argue the plants could be built in factories and then rapidly and cheaply assembled where needed around the UK. An independent review in 2018 said the government should back the plans but a 2017 study by the consortium partner Atkins found that the electricity produced from the small reactors would be a third more expensive than traditional plants. Tom Samson, the interim chief executive of the UK SMR Consortium, said: “We have developed a manufacturing and assembly process that will make reliable, low-carbon nuclear power affordable, deliverable and investable. “By creating a factory-built power station that rolls off the assembly line we have radically reduced many construction risks associated with new nuclear power stations; and by using proven nuclear technology alongside standardised and simplified components, we make it much more cheaply.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/nov/24/uk-government-to-subsidise-onshore-renewable-energy-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-24T00:01:05Z","webTitle":"UK government to subsidise onshore renewable energy projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/24/uk-government-to-subsidise-onshore-renewable-energy-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/nov/24/uk-government-to-subsidise-onshore-renewable-energy-projects","fields":{"headline":"UK government to subsidise onshore renewable energy projects","bodyText":"The government plans to double the amount of renewable energy it will subsidise next year after agreeing to include onshore wind and solar power projects for the first time since 2015. Energy companies will compete for subsidy contracts in a competitive auction to be held at the end of 2021, which could support up to 12GW of renewable energy, or enough clean electricity to charge up to 20m electric vehicles a year. The government expects the auction to be almost double the size of the last 5.8GW auction held in September 2019, in which offshore wind costs tumbled by a third to record lows, and believes it may deliver lower costs too. The next round will include three separate auctions for different renewable energy technologies to compete for a contract which guarantees a price for the clean electricity they generate. There will be one “pot” for offshore wind projects and another for less-established technologies including floating offshore windfarms, energy-from-waste plants and tidal stream projects. The third pot will allow onshore wind and solar farms to compete for a support contract for the first time in six years after the government agreed to drop its opposition to the projects earlier this year. Kwasi Kwarteng, the energy minister, said the new auction would build on the prime minister’s 10-point climate plan to move the UK towards its goal of ending its contribution to rising global carbon emissions by 2050. Boris Johnson’s climate plan includes growing Britain’s offshore windfarms four-fold to 40GW over the next decade, as well plans for green hydrogen and millions of electric vehicles on British roads, which will require a boom in renewable energy. Kwarteng credited the government’s support contracts, known as Contracts for Difference (CfDs) for making the UK “a world leader in clean energy” and added that the next CfD auction would “put us firmly on the path towards building a new, green industrial revolution”. Analysts at the consultancy firm Cornwall Energy said earlier this year that there could be projects totalling 13GW ready to vie for a contract in the next auction. These include 5.5GW of onshore wind and solar farms, 6GW of offshore wind power and the balance made up of more nascent renewable energy technologies. The analysts said this pipeline might change because many renewable energy developers were able to build their projects subsidy-free and might choose not to compete. In the last auction, the cost of offshore wind fell to a price of about £40 per megawatt hour, which is less than the price of electricity in the wholesale energy market and means that consumers will not need to pay extra to support the cost of the projects."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/aug/18/us-public-schools-energy-green-options-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-18T11:00:07Z","webTitle":"The US public schools redesigning buildings with climate in mind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/18/us-public-schools-energy-green-options-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/aug/18/us-public-schools-energy-green-options-climate","fields":{"headline":"The US public schools redesigning buildings with climate in mind","bodyText":"American schools are the second-largest public infrastructure investment. But what most people don’t know is that they are also among the biggest energy consumers in the public sector. K-12 schools consume about 8% of all the energy used in commercial buildings. In turn, they emit as much carbon dioxide as 18 coal-powered power plants. This not only burdens the environment, but children themselves – students suffer from heatstroke, affected hormone and sleep cycles, as well as respiratory issues. Many schools have started redesigning their infrastructure with the climate crisis in mind. From installing more solar panels to replacing old heating, cooling and ventilation systems, or HVAC systems, with more sustainable ones, school districts are increasingly transitioning to cheaper and greener options. But old building habits and funding constraints can pose a challenge. In Maine, one school district has already started making drastic changes. The state’s district 24 is building the Charles M Sumner Learning campus, which will serve more than 500 students from grades six to nine. The 103,000 sq ft building will replace the existing 1950s-era Sumner Memorial high school and feature air-source heat pumps, along with energy recovery ventilation. Arkansas’s Batesville school district, meanwhile, recently installed more than 1,500 solar panels, which now generate about half of the district’s electricity. Before the installations, the district spent over half a million dollars annually on utilities. The solar power changes are now saving the district over $300,000 annually, which is “going to continue to go back into our teachers’ salaries”, said Megan Renihan, the district’s communications coordinator. Similarly, the Santa Barbara Unified school district has launched an ambitious initiative with the Clean Coalition to stage solar microgrids across its 18 school sites. One school, San Marcos high school, is located in the grid-constrained Goleta Load Pocket, an area with extreme fire risk. The solar microgrids will enable the school to operate independently during grid outages and offer indefinite resilience for the most critical loads, such as food service refrigerators and freezers. To architects like Tony Hans, who worked on various zero-energy school projects including the nation’s first net-zero energy school, the best indicator of how energy-efficient a building is going to be is by evaluating how its design team performed when given the goal in the past. “Understanding how that building performed, tracking those metrics, diving into a building after it’s been operational, then learning from that to do better … that creates this cycle of performance-based design,” said Hans, the national director of sustainable projects at consulting engineering firm CMTA. “Most contractors, construction managers and architects believe it costs more to design a more sustainable and energy-efficient school. The truth is it takes more study, a more dedicated team, more iterations and focus on those specific goals,” he said, adding: “It doesn’t take higher construction costs. It takes a paradigm shift.” In 2021, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the country’s schools a D+ in their Report Card for America’s Infrastructure. The report found that 53% of public school districts need to update or replace various building systems. “We know that from anecdotal evidence, the school buildings that were built between the 1950s and 1970s are some of the schools with the most issues,” said Anisa Heming, director of Center for Green Schools at the US Green Building Council. In addition to asbestos, many schools were built with air conditioners that have single-pane windows, often resulting in substantial heat loss during winters. Moreover, many schools have lead soldering in pipes, which experts regard as the major cause of lead contamination of drinking water across the country. As schools battle increasing heatwaves, many also lack the appropriate cooling mechanisms to continue operating. “When we talk about disruptions to our schools, being prepared for hot days is important. It’s not just thinking about singularly adding AC. We need to actually think about how to cool buildings more appropriately in a sustainable way,” said Laura Schifter, a senior fellow at the Aspen Institute’s K12 Climate Action initiative. Numerous schoolyards across the country are made with heat-trapping asphalt, which in turn increases the heat on the playground and community. In an interview with Land and People Magazine, Ricardo Cortes, a parent of a kindergartener at Melrose Leadership Academy in East Oakland, described the effect of hot playground surfaces on his children. “Our kids were coming home sunburned and dehydrated, even from just being out there for a short time at recess. They had headaches. We worried about heatstroke,” he said. As a result, some schools, including Melrose, have started to invest in green sustainable schoolyards, planting various plants and trees to create adequate shade. In addition to heat, poor ventilation has also become a serious issue. More than 41% of schools reported problems with the HVAC systems, “a significant concern for facilities where children routinely spend eight hours a day”. There are significant correlations between air quality and cognitive function among students. Experts have found that increased CO2 levels often result in reduced focus, sleepiness, headaches and increased asthmatic episodes in classrooms. The pandemic has also exacerbated the need for better ventilation systems. Recommendations include “increased ventilation, better filtration, improved air distribution or use of other air cleaning or treatment technologies”. Yet despite the recommendations, not all school districts are equipped to make the changes. In a national survey carried out by ASHRAE and the Center for Green Schools, the most cited challenge to implementation was that many schools were not designed to support the recommended strategies. To address the $38bn annual funding gap for these inadequacies, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island introduced the Reopen and Rebuild America’s Schools Act in January. The act pledges to invest $130bn in public schools. Similarly, the Biden administration’s bipartisan infrastructure deal pledges $50bn in grants and $50bn in bonds for school building improvements, $45bn for eliminating the nation’s lead pipes, including those connected to schools, and $20bn for electrifying school buses. “There are buildings that need to be maintained and retrofitted and so let’s start by never replacing a fossil fuel boiler with another fossil fuel boiler,” says Lisa Hoyos, the national climate strategy director at the League of Conservation Voters. “We need to think about what kind of changes to our physical infrastructure we need to make to make sure those changes don’t exacerbate the problem of climate change.” In addition to mitigating emissions and decarbonizing existing schools, architects and sustainable engineering organizations are designing and building net-zero schools from scratch. Wyck Knox, an architect at VMDO Architects, led the design of Discovery elementary school, the largest certified net-zero energy school in the country, which opened in 2015. The design team prioritised considerations for site footprint, solar orientation, building construction and energy. The 97,588 sq ft building features insulated concrete exterior walls with high thermal mass, bioretention areas that clean and slowly release all of the water from the site, a geothermal well field which supplies heat at a consistent 118F (48.8C), low-flow plumbing fixtures that exceed the energy and water savings targets set by Arlington public schools, and 100% LED lighting. The school also features 1,706 roof-mounted solar panels which were purchased for less than the original budget. “That was kind of the big breakthrough accomplishment that allowed the [Arlington] school district to say, ‘Why would we go back now that we’ve seen that we can get a school to generate all its own clean energy and then some, and put extra clean energy on to the grid for the original price?’” Knox said. As a result, Knox’s next school project was designing Alice West Fleet elementary school, the second of three net-zero energy schools for Arlington public schools. Completed in 2019, the school contains energy-saving features such as optimum solar orientation. Multiple studies have found that schools with optimized daylight increase student performance as natural lighting regulates melatonin and reinforces circadian wellness. In addition to optimized daylight, Alice West Fleet is equipped with high-performance HVAC systems and small individual heat pump units that provide the proper amount of conditioned air only when and where it is needed. The conditioned air is created by exchanging heat with the ground through 72 560ft deep wells underneath the school. The third net-zero energy school, Cardinal elementary school, is set to open in September and will feature a stormwater detention vault to address flooding concerns after the area experienced a record-breaking and damaging deluge in July 2019. Addressing the challenges surrounding these projects, Wyck said: “It’s really about balancing all the competing interests, particularly in urban and dense suburban areas,” adding: “It means having a broader conversation with more people … as resiliency requires comprehensive solutions.” With many American schools undergoing sustainable transitions, they are becoming living laboratories for students as classrooms design educational assignments based on sustainable initiatives, such as calculating the amount of daylight a school building saves. “It really isn’t just about building more sustainable schools, but also cultivating that sort of sustainable mindset in the schools,” Tony Hans said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/may/18/no-new-investment-in-fossil-fuels-demands-top-energy-economist","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-18T05:00:44Z","webTitle":"No new oil, gas or coal development if world is to reach net zero by 2050, says world energy body","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/18/no-new-investment-in-fossil-fuels-demands-top-energy-economist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/may/18/no-new-investment-in-fossil-fuels-demands-top-energy-economist","fields":{"headline":"No new oil, gas or coal development if world is to reach net zero by 2050, says world energy body","bodyText":"Exploitation and development of new oil and gas fields must stop this year and no new coal-fired power stations can be built if the world is to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050, the world’s leading energy organisation has said. In its strongest warning yet on the need to drastically scale back fossil fuels, the International Energy Agency (IEA) also called for no new fossil-fuel cars to be sold beyond 2035, and for global investment in energy to more than double from $2tn (£1.42tn) a year to $5tn (£3.54tn) The result would not be an economic burden, as some have claimed, but a net benefit to the economy. Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director and one of the world’s foremost energy economists, told the Guardian: “If governments are serious about the climate crisis, there can be no new investments in oil, gas and coal, from now – from this year.” He said strong new policies were needed from governments around the world: “More and more countries are coming up with net zero commitments, which is very good, but I see a huge and growing gap between the rhetoric [from governments] and the reality.” The IEA has released its most comprehensive report yet into what is needed to achieve the world’s climate goals, the implications of which will be felt around the world. Few governments intend to halt fossil-fuel exploration. The UK is licensing new oil and gas fields in the North Sea, China is building coal-fired power plants, and oil companies are still investing in new output. Birol said they must reconsider. “Our report does not ban anyone from anything. If governments are planning investments, it is up to them. But if governments make commitments to net zero emissions, they should see what the implications are.” Last month, the IEA warned that emissions would leap by the second biggest rise on record, largely owing to a resurgence of coal following last year’s lockdowns. Pledges made by governments in the run-up to the Cop26 UN climate talks, due to be held in Glasgow this November, are also inadequate and need to be strengthened if the world is to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, he said. That limit, beyond which scientists predict dire consequences from climate breakdown, is the aspirational goal of the 2015 Paris agreement, and will require greenhouse gas emissions to be halved this decade. The report found that these measures would create 30m new jobs, and add 0.4 percentage points a year to global GDP growth. Birol said about 5m jobs would be lost in sectors such as coal, but governments could do much to ease the transition. Birol said that the technology to halve emissions by 2030 was already available and must be rolled out even faster. “A huge part can be done with existing technologies, there are no problems there,” he said. John Kerry, the US climate envoy, caused controversy when he suggested at the weekend that half of the carbon reductions needed to reach net zero by 2050 would be made using new technology. Climate experts including Michael Mann have become increasingly worried that some new critiques of climate action, such as the book published recently by the software billionaire Bill Gates, have focused too much on an idea that futuristic technologies will save the world from climate chaos, rather than focusing on what can be done today. Since the climate responds to cumulative emissions rather than current emissions, if cuts to carbon are left to the future and not made in this decade, it will be too late to stay within the 1.5C limit. Birol made it clear that the technology needed to reach net zero is neither blue-sky nor futuristic. He said: “These technologies are already invented, but not yet in full development. Innovation is critical, but the technologies are here with us.” The crucial new technologies in development are: advanced batteries, particularly for use in electric vehicles; hydrogen; and carbon capture. These will be needed because some sectors are especially hard to decarbonise, such as steel and cement manufacturing, aviation and shipping, and those using heavy-duty road vehicles. Birol said that most of the rest of the global economy could be decarbonised using economical technologies that are already in widespread use, such as wind and solar power. The IEA has set out 400 milestones for governments to reach, including the phasing out of new fossil-fuel cars from 2035 and the decarbonisation of global electricity generation by 2040. Its analysis also took into account a global population rise of about 2 billion people, as well as the need to supply electricity to 785 million people who do not have access to it, and clean cooking to the 2.6 billion people who currently lack it. Doing so would cost about $40bn a year, or 1% of global annual energy sector investment, and would cut premature deaths from indoor air pollution by about 2.5m a year. The IEA undertook the report – the most comprehensive yet into the global requirements to meet the net zero emissions target – at the request of the UK government. Alok Sharma, president-designate of Cop26 and a former UK business secretary, said: “We must act now to scale up clean technologies in all sectors and phase out both coal power and polluting vehicles in the coming decade. Our first goal for the UK as Cop26 presidency is to put the world on a path to driving down emissions, until they reach net zero by the middle of this century.” The UK has begun the process of licensing new oil and gas fields in the North Sea and has also mooted a new coalmine for coking coal. Birol said that governments should consider what would happen to future demand and whether they might be left with stranded assets in the future. He added that the IEA predicts that global oil demand will decline from the 90m barrels a day at present to about 24m barrels a day by 2050. “Therefore there will not be a need for new investments in oil and gas fields, or new investments in coalmines,” he said. “It depends how governments take climate change seriously.” • This article was amended on 18 May 2021.

But some experts say that’s fine as the kind of stimulus programs that have been pursued in harder-hit countries weren’t needed. “I think we were in dire need last year. I think we are in slightly less dire need right now because our unemployment rate has bounced back because we got it largely under control,” says University of New South Wales economics professor Richard Holden. “That said, it is very clear from this budget and it is very clear from Treasury and Reserve Bank analysis of how low the unemployment rate can get before inflation really starts moving that we are going to be targeting an unemployment rate around 4% or maybe even lower ... That’s a lot of jobs that need to be created, a lot of people that need to be put to work.” In total the federal budget papers estimate that A$291bn has been spent in direct economic support since the beginning of the pandemic. This equals 14.7% of GDP. However, this is lower than the spending estimate of the Centre for Economic Policy Research’s economic stimulus index, which includes state government revenue and spending measures. As of 6 May, before the federal budget was handed down, its data shows Australia had announced fiscal measures equal to 17% of GDP – significantly lower than Japan, which had committed funding equal to 54% of GDP. Singapore had committed 29%, the United States 26% and Germany 20% of their respective GDPs. The Oxford University Economic Recovery Project has been tracking Covid-19 recovery spending announced by 50 countries around the world. “Covid-19 has brought with it the greatest global economic correction since world war two; worldwide unemployment is high, economic product is low, and poverty has increased for the first time in a quarter of a century,” says Brian O’Callaghan, Australian economist and the engineer who leads the Economic Recovery Project. “Public investment acts as a stimulus to get the economic gears of a nation turning at full pace once again. Governments can use recovery spending to orient an economy towards future growth industries while also providing immediate boosts to employment and economic production (GDP).” Guardian Australia added recent infrastructure and Covid-19 packages from Australia, the United Kingdom, United States and South Korea. This included $15.2bn and $28.5bn Australian dollars the federal government recently announced in infrastructure spending and tax measures. “[The Australian infrastructure spending] is a lot. That is one-and-a-half times the normal level of investment in transport,” says the Grattan Institute’s transport and cities program director Marion Terrill. “The budget took us back to transport megaprojects. And that’s after a short break in the past budget where the biggest single contribution from the commonwealth was $750m. In this budget the commonwealth put in $2bn or more into three whopping great big projects.” The budget included $2bn for an intermodal terminal in Melbourne, $2.6bn for the Anzac Highway in South Australia and $2bn for the Great Western Highway in NSW. But many other countries have been comparatively more ambitious. The UK has committed £58bn and £20bn for road and rail upgrades, and its long-term housing strategy. Spain has earmarked upwards of €8bn for energy and infrastructure projects. China has announced a stream of new projects, from renovating old roads to high-speed rail, and nuclear and solar power. Terrill questions whether big infrastructure projects are necessarily good stimulus, especially as they often have long lead times. The sheer number of large infrastructure projects around the world will also drive up costs. “They are drawing on the resources of an industry that is already overstretched. Before the pandemic, engineering and construction was already hitting its limits. The number working in the sector had surged by 50% in the three years leading up to the pandemic. And it’s not like the mining boom where we imported more skilled workers from overseas to make up the shortfall. The borders are shut now and government transport construction has been pretty recession-proof.” O’Callaghan also notes that the kind of mega projects Australia is pursuing are more traditional infrastructure, of the “gas-led recovery” variety, rather than renewable energy or other clean projects that others are pursuing. “Australia has been one of the worst high-income nations on green recovery, if not the very worst. Whereas nations like Denmark, Germany, the UK, and Korea have dedicated up to 60% of recovery spending to green initiatives, prior to the federal budget, only 2% of Australian recovery spending was green”, says O’Callaghan. Richard Holden noted that this may be due to a lack of such projects in the pipeline long before the pandemic hit. “We should have a lot of green, shovel-ready projects to do green stimulus if we are in a need to stimulate the economy we ought to be able to rollout, whether it is dune care or building cycleways or waterway cleanup – a whole range of things that tend to be relatively labour-intensive that would be a good way to spend money, “says Richard Holden. “It would put people back to work in a recession and things like that, and also help the natural environment.” Notes and methods: Ceyhun Elgin, Gokce Basbug and Abdullah Yalaman used the IMF’s policy response tracker to decide what fiscal measures to include in their dataset Guardian Australia supplemented the Oxford Recovery Observatory dataset with measures announced after 28/02/2021 (and listed in the IMF’s policy response tracker) for the United States, United Kingdom and South Korea Guardian Australia used the Australian federal government’s list of Covid-19 economic support measures to supplement the Oxford Recovery Observatory dataset for Australia Categorisation of the American Rescue Plan sourced from the Wall Street Journal South Korea’s Extra Budget data sourced from the Yonhap News Agency Newly announced infrastructure and revenue measures from Australia, South Korea, the US and UK were added to the Oxford Recovery Observatory dataset and classified according to the typologies in their methodology.

The rest need not actually turn to desert or be under water, but just won’t be able to sustain the people stuck there. It will be very, very ugly. So let’s try to prevent it happening. CanalChris The effects are very unpredictable and often downright perverse. If (for example) the Gulf Stream gets turned off by polar meltwater, one likely effect is that the north-west coast of Europe will become icebound every winter, Britain being on the same latitude as Labrador. Some regions will become disastrously dry, while others will become disastrously wet. AnChiarogEile Some friends did this exercise some years ago and apparently Winchester is at a good height to avoid rising waters. I would avoid anywhere in the Netherlands for this reason. Cider_Woman James Lovelock suggested in 2008 that Britain would be an oasis compared to some other places (the rest of Europe). So select somewhere well above sea level (not Winchester; Winchester is already full). Whatever you do, avoid Winchester … MeinHerr The Winchester, till it all blows over, surely? GrannyBev You should stay where you are, change your lifestyle and help those around you to also change theirs. There is only this one planet and there is no “away” to go to. Face the problem and do something that will help to create a viable future. Reterritorialisation The romantic in me would like to think that moving to the isolation of the Scottish Highlands is the answer; sadly, it’s not. London – that’s where the finances are, that’s where the politics is. It’s the place least likely to be affected by shortages and the first place that will attract protective measures (there’s a reason London had a technologically advanced flood barrier built in the 80s and not the other UK port cities). honeytree What struck me was the profound selfishness of this question. It reflects the cult of individualism that has partly created the problems we are facing. We have a collective responsibility to deal with the crisis of planet heating. The questions you should be asking are: “What can I do to be part of the solution and what can I stop doing that’s making me part of the problem?” Maggie Wicks, Wakefield You will have to think upper northern hemisphere, which rules out most of the UK, with the possible exception of northern mainland Scotland, Shetland and Orkney (the only issue being accessible potable water in sufficient quantities). Outside the UK, think polar and subpolar regions such as northern Canada, northern Scandinavia, Alaska, China and Russia. As the climate warms, these regions will transform to become much more habitable; they will also have access to significant amounts of fresh water. ArcticIslander Habitable, yes, yet still without much sunlight in winter – and agriculture will be difficult. Mnemon I would have said northern Canada, Patagonia, Siberia; well above sea level. But the recent extreme weather in north-west Canada – 49C! – has made me think again. The problem is not just everywhere becoming hotter than at present, but the disruption of climate as masses of air (and water) change their patterns, initially chaotically, possibly in the fullness of time (decades? centuries?) establishing moderately stable new patterns. Conceivably, Britain may be relatively well placed, depending on what happens with the Gulf Stream and jet stream. pol098 Admit that asking this question, 40 years after the global south asked this question, means you are already in the safest place.

GardChr So far, it appears that the North American midwest, where I live, has less climate change than other areas. LONAHANSEN Michigan. A geopolitics and globalisation expert, Parag Khanna, says in a newly published book, Move: The Forces Uprooting Us, that the Great Lakes region – and specifically Michigan – may become the best place on the planet to live by 2050 because of climate change. TimInMichigan I can’t think of a better place than Mwanza, Tanzania. On the shores of Lake Victoria, so abundant fresh water. An equable climate, 1,000 metres above sea level. And a stable government that is not corrupt. JimToddMwanz The question aptly demonstrates the reason why climate change is being addressed so ineffectually. Some people, even nations, believe that they can escape unscathed … Legomania Even if we think a location might be good, there are possible negative and positive feedback mechanisms that are yet to kick in or might accelerate in ways we had not imagined. Perhaps a better question is which location has the best options for adapting to any potential impacts? Plato301 We’re betting on Galicia in Spain. We’re 5km from the Atlantic, so, by definition, a maritime climate with few spikes in temperature and blissfully cool summer nights compared with the Languedoc. Rainfall is spread throughout the year, although autumn is usually the wettest season. True, the largest cities are at sea level, but it’s plenty hilly enough that you can move up – our house is at 100 metres. The only risk from climate change I can foresee is if summers get dryer (which they already are, to a lesser extent) – the risk of forest fires. There are a lot of eucalyptus trees here, although it’s forbidden to plant new ones now. Oh, and our wines here are 11-12.5%. winebore Top of the priority list is water. If you don’t have a secure source of water, move immediately. sonicuniverse Not near a nuclear power station. Dirkum Climate-change effects, if not controlled now, will be incremental and knock on in a variety of ways – it’s not simply a matter of finding the Garden of Eden and planting potatoes. There will be unrest like you’ve never known. Undesirables roaming the countryside. Sickness. Lack of services. Probably war. Nowhere will be safe. All I’d suggest for now is you move to a more remote region to a house with a large garden and a spring, preferably within a friendly farming community. If you really want some idea, try to imagine what the world will be without electricity. SawdustCaesar This ideal, tiny, perfect place will quickly be filled with a couple of million others, who will quickly go at each other’s throats because there’s not enough space and resources at this best place … MichaelHoe When I saw the effects of the recent heatwave in Canada in an area that normally has a temperate climate, I realised that it is impossible to predict exactly what is going to happen and that nowhere is predictably, reliably safe. The only thing is to try to build a resilient community where you are. Take steps now to reduce your carbon footprint and start building a resilient local community. mrsdoom I wish to nominate Upper Edinbane on the truly magnificent and wondrous Isle of Skye. The reasons being: the wind sweeps in mainly from the west, clearing the air of pollution. It is not over-inhabited. It is located on a hilly incline, so no danger whatsoever of flooding. There are beautiful views, including those of the village of Edinbane below. There is a true community spirit. One day, I intend to retire there and write poetry to inspire others. John Osborn You need to move the opinion of everyone you come into contact with, so they become activists and destroy the power of the inactivists. Mark Hayden You shouldn’t – and such an attitude is akin to rich guys rushing to the lifeboats on a sinking ship. Instead, you should support effective climate action by contributing time, money and effort, then changing your lifestyle accordingly. If you must move, buy an intensive farm and switch it to regenerative methods and/or silviculture, but stop trying to avoid the problem when you should be trying to help solve it. Iain Climie This has already been well documented. May I suggest the book Six Degrees by Mark Lynas and maybe How to Blow Up a Pipeline by Andreas Malm. The only places people will be able to live: the south coast of Alaska; the coast/west side of the Rockies, from British Columbia up and down into Oregon; the south-west region of Chilean Patagonia and Fireland; the Antarctic peninsula; the central ridge of New Guinea; the Himalaya foothills in east India; western parts of China and maybe the Tibetan plateau; parts of Scandinavia; small enclaves in the Pyrenees, Alps and British mountains; and the coastal regions of Greenland. MV Italiaander, the Netherlands (yes, still, haha) I chose to move to an abandoned farm in the barely inhabited woods of inland Sweden and based my decisions on these guidelines: far away from large population centres far away from places that are strategically desirable (ports, military bases, fertile land, minerals, power plants) a society with high levels of trust in government and neighbours and with little or no “pre-existing conditions” such as unresolved internal conflicts from the past As land is cheap here, I was able to buy a lot of land around the house. I’m not the only anticipated climate refugee in this area, so others have come to similar conclusions. Anticipated Climate Refugee (from Belgium) May I suggest Antarctica. Temperature has already reached 18.3C (64.9F) in summer and it has the world’s fastest increasing temperatures. In the past 50 years, the peninsula warmed almost 3C (5.4F), significantly higher than the global average of 0.9C (1.6F). It’s getting greener, too, and it will soon be possible to keep cattle and grow food. Fresh water will probably be in good supply – thanks to all the melted glaciers. Sadly, there will no penguins. Anders Jalakas, Uddevalla Personally, I think there are too many unknowns and that survivalism requires too much personal investment to stand even a small chance of success. In my opinion, the climate crisis is first and before all a food crisis in disguise. So my best bet is to find a place in a village with a strong sense of community, with a tradition for growing their own food locally, wherever that may be. Far from the maritime coasts, obviously, and preferably in or near mountains, but not too close to forests, to avoid the risk of uncontrollable fires. Based on the assumption that we expect more warming than cooling, a land that is not necessarily facing south all day. I chose a village in the Tatra mountains of Slovakia. Yannick Cornet In the late 60s, an anarchist magazine in Germany or the Netherlands published a map of Europe post-nuclear war. The only parts of Europe to avoid fallout were the peninsulas in south-west Ireland. As a result, these places filled up with hippies. As long as you weave your own yoghurt sandals, you couldn’t put a foot wrong in Castletownbere or Ballydehob. Pascal Desmond I am in the process of moving to Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands. A land of near permanent sunshine and solar power. A land of almost limitless wind for wind power. We don’t waste precious water washing cars, flushing the toilets etc, as all supplied water is desalinated sea water. Drinking water is bottled (yes, I wish it wasn’t plastic bottles). If only other countries harnessed wind and solar in the same way and used desalinated water for most everyday jobs – the world would be a better and safer place. Malcolm Weston Llandrindod Wells!

But there is good news: we already have every tool we need to beat it. The challenge is not identifying the solutions, but rolling them out with great speed. Some key sectors are already racing ahead, such as electric cars. They are already cheaper to own and run in many places – and when the purchase prices equal those of fossil-fueled vehicles in the next few years, a runaway tipping point will be reached. Electricity from renewables is now the cheapest form of power in most places, sometimes even cheaper than continuing to run existing coal plants. There’s a long way to go to meet the world’s huge energy demand, but the plummeting costs of batteries and other storage technologies bodes well. And many big companies are realising that a failure to invest will be far more expensive as the impacts of global heating destroy economies. Even some of the biggest polluters, such as cement and steel, have seen the green writing on the wall. Buildings are big emitters but the solution – improved energy efficiency – is simple to achieve and saves the occupants money, particularly with the cost of installing technology such as heat pumps expected to fall. Stopping the razing of forests requires no technology at all, but it does require government action. While progress is poor – and Bolsonaro’s Brazil is going backwards – countries such as Indonesia have shown regulatory action can be effective. Protecting and restoring forests, particularly by empowering indigenous people, is a potent tool. Recognition of the role food and farming play in driving global heating is high, and the solutions, from alternatives to meat to regenerative farming, are starting to grow. As with fossil fuels, ending vast and harmful subsidies is key, and there are glimmers of hope here, too. In the climate crisis, every fraction of a degree matters and so every action reduces people’s suffering. Every action makes the world a cleaner and better place to live – by, for example, cutting the air pollution that ends millions of lives a year. The real fuel for the green transition is a combination of those most valuable and intangible of commodities: political will and skill. The supply is being increased by demands for action from youth strikers to chief executives, and must be used to face down powerful vested interests, such as the fossil fuel, aviation and cattle industries. The race for a sustainable, low-carbon future is on, and the upcoming Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow will show how much faster we need to go. Transport Responsible for 14-28% of global greenhouse gas emissions, transport has been slow to decarbonise, and faces particular challenges in areas such as long-haul flight. But technical solutions are available, if the will, public policy and spending are there, too. Electric cars are the most obvious: petrol and diesel vehicles will barely be produced in Europe within the decade. EV sales are accelerating everywhere, with the likes of Norway well past the tipping point, and cheaper electric vehicles coming from China have cut the fumes from buses. Meanwhile, combustion engines are ever more efficient and less polluting. Bike and scooter schemes are growing rapidly as cities around the world embrace electric micromobility. Far cleaner ships for global freight are coming. The potential of hydrogen is growing, for cleaner trains where electrification is impractical, to be followed by ships and even, one day, planes. Manufacturers expect short-haul electric aircraft much sooner. Most of all, the pandemic has shown that a world without hypermobility is possible – and that many people will accept, or even embrace, a life where they commute and travel less. Gwyn Topham Deforestation Deforestation and land use change are the second-largest source of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. The destruction of the world’s forests has continued at a relentless pace during the pandemic, with millions of hectares lost, driven by land-clearing in the Brazilian Amazon. But there are reasons for hope. The UK has put nature at the heart of its Cop26 presidency and behind the scenes, the government is pushing hard for finance and new commitments from forested nations to protect the world’s remaining carbon banks. Indonesia and Malaysia, once global hotspots of deforestation, have experienced significant falls in recent years, the result of increased restrictions on palm oil plantations. However, the 2000s soy moratorium in Brazil shows these trends are reversible. Finally, there is a growing recognition of the importance of indigenous communities to protecting the world’s forests and biodiversity. In the face of racism and targeted violence, a growing number of studies and reports show they are the best guardians of the forest. Empowering those communities will be vital to ending deforestation. Patrick Greenfield Technology Emissions from technology companies, including direct emissions, emissions from electricity use and other operations such as manufacturing, account for 0.3% of global carbon emissions, while emissions from cryptocurrencies is a huge emerging issue. Mining – the process in which a bitcoin is awarded to a computer that solves a complex series of algorithms – is a deeply energy-intensive process and only gets more energy-intensive as the algorithms grow more complex. But new mining methods are lighter, environmentally. A system called “proof of stake” has a 99% lower carbon footprint. Scrutiny of the whole sector is increasing, spearheaded by tech workers who walked out in their hundreds to join climate change marches in 2019. The companies have pledged to do better: Amazon aims to be net zero carbon by 2040 and powered with 100% renewable energy by 2025. Facebook has a target of net zero emissions for its entire supply chain by 2030 and Microsoft has pledged to become carbon negative by 2030. Apple has committed to become carbon-neutral across its whole supply chain by 2030. They’re still falling short when it comes to delivering, but employee groups continue to push. Kari Paul Business For decades Exxon Mobil has arguably been corporate America’s biggest climate change denier. But this year, the activist investor Engine No 1 won three seats on the company’s board with an agenda to force the company to finally acknowledge and confront the climate crisis. Across corporate America and all around the world there are signs of change. The Federal Reserve, the world’s most powerful central bank, is beefing up its climate team. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investor, has made environmental sustainability a core goal for the company. This isn’t about ideology: it’s about “common sense.” According to BlackRock, failure to tackle climate change is simply bad for business. The investor calculates that 58% of the US will suffer economic decline by 2060-2080 if nothing is done. Much more needs to be done, and some question whether corporate America can really solve this crisis without government action. But the days of denial are over – what matters now is action. Dom Rushe Electricity The rocketing global market price for gas has ripped through world economies, forcing factories to close, triggering blackouts in China, and threatening to cool the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. But it has also spelled out a clear economic case for governments to redouble their efforts in developing homegrown, low-carbon electricity systems. The good news is that renewable energy is ready to step up and play a greater role in electricity systems across the globe. The precipitous fall in the price of wind and solar energy has helped to incentivise fresh investments in electricity vehicles and energy storage technologies, such as batteries, where costs are plummeting too. Soon, wind and solar power will help to produce green hydrogen, which can be stored over long periods of time to generate electricity during days that are a little less bright or breezy. All of these advances are made possible by cheap renewables, and will help countries to use more renewable energy too. There has never been a better time to step back from gas and go green. Jillian Ambrose Buildings The built environment is one of our biggest polluters, responsible for about 40% of global carbon emissions. Over the past two decades, the carbon footprint of buildings “in use” has been greatly reduced by energy-saving technologies – better insulation, triple-glazing, and on-site renewables such as solar panels and ground-source heat pumps. Onheat pumps, the UK lags far behind: Norway, through a mixture of grants and high electricity prices, has installed more than 600 heat pumps for every 1,000 households. As national energy grids are decarbonising, the focus is shifting to reducing the “embodied energy” of materials – which can account for up to three-quarters of a building’s emissions over its lifespan – for example by reducing the amount of concrete and steel in favour of timber. There is also a growing movement to prioritise refurbishment and reuse over demolition, driven by the realisation that the most sustainable buildings are the ones that already exist. Oliver Wainwright Food and farming The hoofprint of the global livestock industry is a significant one, accounting for about 14% of total annual greenhouse gas emissions. But it is increasingly recognised and accepted by national governments. New Zealand now has a legal commitment to reduce methane emissions from agriculture by 10% by 2030, while Denmark has passed a legally binding target to reduce climate emissions from the agricultural sector by 55% by 2030. While global meat production is increasing, there is a growing shift towards fish and poultry, which have a comparatively lower emissions footprint than red meats. The food industry is also developing a range of lower-carbon products using plant-based proteins such as soy and pea, and insect and lab-grown meat alternatives. Tom Levitt Manufacturing Decarbonising the manufacturing of every product needed by a modern economy is a vast and varied task. Some sectors are well on their way. For instance, Apple, the world’s third-largest maker of mobile phones by volume, has pledged to produce net zero carbon throughout its supply chain by 2030. For many others, advances in efficiency of factories and their products will be accelerated by machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies that are still in their infancy. There are even hopeful signs in some of the hardest sectors to decarbonise, such as plans by Volvo to replace coal with hydrogen in the steel it uses in cars. One of the greatest reasons for optimism is manufacturers’ increasing awareness of circular design principles. Making products easier to recycle from the start will help to cut emissions from fresh resource extraction– although a bigger question remains as to whether rich societies can reduce consumption, the most obvious way to cut emissions.

We have such a special bond.” According to a DNA test, the sandy-furred pup is mostly chow chow and great pyrenees, with a little bit of boxer and lab in the mix, which accounts for the fact she has tripled in size in the six-and-a-bit months since her adoption. “She was a little wolf baby; a peanut!” the 22-year-old singer-songwriter exclaims, mooning nostalgically over one particular image depicting the then seven-week-old puppy peeking out of some bushes. Dog ownership might have become quite the ultimate lockdown cliche, but for Cottrill committing to a pet represented a rare opportunity to lay down some roots. Certainly, pre-pandemic she hadn’t had much chance to pursue a life of quiet domesticity; not since the autumn of 2018 at least, when the lo-fi bedroom pop of Pretty Girl went viral, just weeks after she started college in Syracuse. Its winningly DIY video racked up more than 1.5m YouTube views pretty much overnight (it now stands at almost 75m), and Cottrill was heralded as a vital new voice, and part of a wave of creatively autonomous, emotionally articulate Gen Z artists, alongside the likes of Billie Eilish and Rex Orange County. Cottrill’s rapid rise – not to mention her signing with the Fader label and Chance the Rapper’s management team – was not without controversy. A small but vocal subset on Reddit circulated the rumour that Cottrill was an “industry plant”, a conclusion they arrived at following their discovery that her father Geoff was previously chief marketing officer at Converse and co-founder of its affiliated recording studio Rubber Tracks. She has recently addressed the allegations directly, telling Rolling Stone, “I definitely am not blind to the fact that things have been easier for me.” Largely though, Cottrill has sought to prove her detractors wrong through the quality of her compositions. First came Diary 001, an esoteric, six-track set mining skeletal hip-hop and the wipe-clean grooves of PC Music-inspired pop. That was followed in August 2019 by Immunity, the full-length debut she co-produced with ex-Vampire Weekend man Rostam Batmanglij. More revelatory than Diary 001, it detailed a suicide attempt (Alewife) and her struggles with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (I Wouldn’t Ask You) with striking candour. Sonically, it paired tender, electronics-tinged introspection with swooning guitar-pop. Sofia, which now boasts 280m streams on Spotify, catapulted Cottrill into another league of fame entirely, leading to collaborations with Charli XCX, Mura Masa and Arlo Parks, plus arena tours in support of Khalid and Tame Impala. Cottrill was busy with the latter when Covid hit the US. On hearing the news, she headed straight to Atlanta, Georgia, to see out lockdown with family, a period of isolation originally scheduled to last a fortnight but which went on for eight months. Just how intense was it spending the best part of a year holed up with her parents? “It was awesome,” she insists, now back at the Brooklyn apartment she shares with fellow musicians and former college pals Claud and Josh Mehling. “My older sister came home as well. And I found it interesting that no matter how much you’ve progressed as an adult in your own life, the family roles revert back to exactly how it was as a kid.” First and foremost, enforced confinement provided the opportunity for Cottrill to deepen her relationship with her mother. “The conversations I had with my mom about motherhood, and the things she sacrificed for us, are really important to me,” she says. “Also, it’s like you don’t actually know who your mother is before she’s Mom, before she’s Wife, because there isn’t a huge documentation of who she was as an individual. And I realised that I might be in the period of my life now where I’m in my individual phase: before I am Mom, before I am Wife, or whatever I end up being. It was a bit scary to recognise that I could eventually have a family, and then this whole identity that I’ve had on my own for a long time can, in some ways, disappear.” These existential ideas form the basis of Cottrill’s much-anticipated second album. Recorded in the autumn of 2020 at Allaire Studios – situated on a mountain top in upstate New York – Sling finds Jack Antonoff co-producing. Perhaps more significantly, the record also features backing vocals from Lorde – on Reaper as well as the lead single Blouse – an alliance that led to Cottrill returning the favour on the New Zealander’s latest, Solar Power. “I met Lorde [when I was] on FaceTime with Jack,” she says of the link-up. “He was like: ‘Hey, I’m with a friend, can we say hi?’, and it was Lorde. And I freaked out, of course, but she’s the nicest person ever. “We talked a lot about how cool it was in the Laurel Canyon era, where people would secretly do background vocals on each other’s music – like Joni Mitchell with Carole King – rather than as a way to benefit the business side of things. Back then it was just like: ‘I love your voice: will you lend your talent to my song?’ So that’s what I asked her, and I was just lucky enough that she wanted me on hers as well.” The legacy of Laurel Canyon looms over Sling, which swaps the sparse electronic flourishes of Immunity for lush, acoustic folk, often embellished with swooning vocal harmonies, delicate strings and the warm swell of brass. Reference points for the record included Hejira-era Mitchell, the Carpenters and Harry Nilsson, alongside less obvious touchpoints, such as cult jazz musician Blossom Dearie. Most influential, perhaps, was Innocence &amp; Despair by the Langley Schools Music Project, which features a choir of 1970s school kids covering hits of the day, and has since been hailed as a significant piece of outsider art. “To me, that record merged my two worlds for Sling,” Cottrill explains. “I wanted that warm 70s feeling, but also I was thinking so much about kids, and especially the clumsy, sweet kid that Joanie embodies.” There is a darker side to the record too, as Cottrill grapples with the reality of life navigating an industry that she memorably describes – on Bambi – as “a universe designed against my own beliefs”. On Blouse she describes her experiences being sexualised by record execs, while on Management she parodies the industry’s fascination with youth in lines like “She’s only 22”. “[The attitude is] ‘There’s a lot more that we can squeeze out of her before she’s done.’ Because I think that what this industry does a lot is drain young women of everything until they’re not youthful any more.” For Cottrill, as much as Sling is an album, it is a document of her endeavours to reassess what it is she wants from life. And adopting Joanie was only the first step: in two weeks’ time she plans to move into the house she recently purchased, in a tiny Massachusetts town in close proximity to both the Berkshire and Catskill mountains. “It’s so awful that it took something like lockdown happening for me to reevaluate how I wanted to move forward. But it’s now about putting my mental health first, because I deserve to have nice things that I do care about. [Things] outside of music, like a house and a dog.” As we say goodbye, I get another glimpse of Joanie, who has been snoozing throughout the interview. Sprawled on the floor at the end of Cottrill’s bed, blissfully unaware of her significance in our conversations, it’s a pretty fitting encapsulation of the pace of life that Cottrill has finally embraced. Sling is out on Friday 16 July"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/sep/07/australian-coal-plants-on-a-hiding-to-nothing-and-likely-to-close-before-schedule","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-06T23:41:26Z","webTitle":"Australian coal plants 'on a hiding to nothing' and likely to close before schedule","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/07/australian-coal-plants-on-a-hiding-to-nothing-and-likely-to-close-before-schedule","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/sep/07/australian-coal-plants-on-a-hiding-to-nothing-and-likely-to-close-before-schedule","fields":{"headline":"Australian coal plants 'on a hiding to nothing' and likely to close before schedule","bodyText":"Australia’s ageing coal-fired power plants make little money and are likely to shut sooner than planned due to the amount of cheap renewable energy coming into the grid, the chair of Australia’s Energy Security Board said. Kerry Schott said the expected early coal closures and the rise of variable renewable energy, including the surge of solar power in the middle of the day, are among changes demanding a major revamp of rules governing the national energy market. A consultation paper released on Monday sets out the board’s proposals. “With so many renewables coming in it is more likely coal plants go sooner than their technical life date because they’re not making much money,” she told Guardian Australia. “In fact, when there is wind and solar available they don’t get dispatched [into the grid] yet they are sitting there burning coal like sort of chuggers. “You pay to run them and then you get dispatched a few hours a day, and the more renewables that come in the less you get dispatched. In that sense, they are on a hiding to nothing.” Schott said a challenge that needed consideration was ensuring there was enough flexible capacity for the grid to cope if a large coal plant shut abruptly. In Victoria and New South Wales, in particular, the coal fleet was old and “the probability of having a boiler blow up that’s not worth fixing is not trivial”. Coal plants were often dispatched not for energy, but because they provided frequency and inertia – services needed for grid stability. Placing a value on those services could keep coal plants running longer, but those services could also come from batteries and synchronous condensers which were increasingly being introduced to support wind and solar plants. Coal still provides about two-thirds of electricity in the five eastern states, which are connected through the national market. But with renewable energy installations increasing significantly since 2017, some old plants run well below capacity. A recent report by the Australia Institute found the NSW coal fleet was running at about 60% of its total capacity and the Queensland fleet less than 70%, increasing the likelihood of plants closing before their scheduled dates. The only coal plant scheduled to shut in the next eight years is Liddell, in NSW, by early 2023, but government analysis suggests 60% of the fleet would close by 2040. Renewable energy makes up about a quarter of all generation. Solar panels are installed on more than 2.2m houses, up from 100,000 a decade ago. The record pace of large-scale renewable installations was expected to slow in coming years after a dramatic fall in investment in new projects over the past year, but Schott said the influx of solar power already meant demand from the grid in the middle of the day was low, creating network stability issues. “At the moment it is getting managed by turning people [solar] off, which is not ideal,” she said. “We’ve got to find ways of managing that and providing value, and getting people to use their power in different hours of the day and manage it all easily.” Schott said the revamped market rules would need to reflect that consumers in an increasingly digitised world would be able to manage their electricity use to suit their needs and lower costs. The CSIRO and Energy Networks Australia found a two-sided market in which consumers were paid for savings they made in what was required from the grid could save households on average $414 a year. She said it was likely at least two more markets for energy-related services would need to be created that valued services other than pure electricity generation. Likely future markets could be in reserve generation capacity – effectively for the flexible energy that can be called on when needed to back up variable wind and solar – and providing the frequency and inertia needed. Frequency could be delivered by batteries, which were expected to play a growing role. If those markets were created in the right way it would cost consumers considerably less than market interventions that could involve regulators telling plants to stay open and paying “a motza” in return. The security board paper is looking at what would be needed beyond 2025, but Schott said some changes were being introduced and would continue to be. It is taking submissions until 19 October and is expected to give its initial recommendations to federal and state energy ministers by the end of the year. A final report is due mid-2021. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found limiting global heating to 1.5C was likely to require coal power being reduced by between 59% and 78% below 2010 levels by 2030 and the globe reaching net zero emissions by 2050."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-russian-rebels-belgorod-attack-raid-anti-putin-militia-latest-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T17:51:52Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Belarus says transfer of nuclear weapons from Russia has begun –  as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-russian-rebels-belgorod-attack-raid-anti-putin-militia-latest-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-russian-rebels-belgorod-attack-raid-anti-putin-militia-latest-news","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Belarus says transfer of nuclear weapons from Russia has begun –  as it happened","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s main news: Russia moved ahead on Thursday with a plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president, claimed that the relocation of some of the weapons from Russia to Belarus had already started, according to reports. Unverified footage appears to show a drone speedboat attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs in the Black Sea on Wednesday. The video appears to show at least one of the drones getting extremely close to the ship, though it remains unclear whether or not any damage was done. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has begun withdrawing its forces from the devastated Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and transferring its positions there to regular Russian troops, according to its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin. Ukraine has secured the release of 106 captured soldiers in a prisoner exchange with Russia on Thursday, according to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff. The soldiers, including eight officers, were reportedly said to have been captured fighting in Bakhmut. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it had summoned the ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and Denmark to protest over what it described as the “complete lack of results” in an investigation to identify who blew up the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year. Ukraine said on Thursday it had shot down all 36 Iranian-made drones launched by Russia in overnight attacks which it claims likely targeted key infrastructure and military facilities. Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after users on social media and reports in the local Tass news agency said emergency services had been called to the building. State-owned Tass initially reported on a fire at the ministry early on Thursday morning, but later reported the ministry saying there was none. Dutch prosecutors have seized a plot of land near Amsterdam that belongs to Vladimir Putin’s former son-in-law, a joint investigation by the Guardian and two other media organisations can reveal. The plot of land in Duivendrecht is owned by Jorrit Faassen, a Dutch businessman who was married to Maria Vorontsova, the Russian president’s elder daughter. An entry in the Dutch land registry shows that the plot of land was seized on 12 May by the national public prosecutor’s office for financial, economic and environmental offences. The agency is responsible for enforcing sanctions compliance. Dutch cadastre documents show that the land plot was seized as part of a criminal investigation. You can read more of this exclusive, by my colleagues Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer, here: America has long asked Ukraine not to use US-provided military equipment to carry out attacks inside Russian territory, Gen Mark Milley, the top US general, said on Thursday. Milley, who is chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said his office was looking into imagery appearing to show vehicles allegedly used in an attack around the Russian border region of Belgorod. But he said the US position against such US equipment being used inside Russia was clear to Kyiv, Reuters reports. During talks held this week in Kyiv, Ukraine’s defence minister personally thanked Ben Wallace for the UK’s continued military support for Ukraine, the Ministry of Defence has said. The UK defence secretary met his counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, during a visit to the Ukrainian capital, after the UK provided Ukraine with long-range precision strike capability earlier this month. British sources have said giving Storm Shadow missiles was compatible with the UK’s signature to the voluntary missile technology control regime, which is intended to limit the proliferation of cruise missiles. Wallace said in comments released on Thursday: I was pleased to visit Kyiv again to meet with my good friend Oleksii Reznikov to discuss the next stages of Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s illegal invasion. The UK continues to offer equipment, training and advice to Ukraine’s armed forces. I also visited some of the military commanders who have been so bravely pushing back Russian forces. Russia’s defence ministry said on Thursday that it had scrambled fighter jets to escort two US strategic bomber planes away from the Russian border as they flew over the Baltic Sea, Reuters reports. “The crew of the Russian fighter aircraft identified the aerial targets as two US air force B-1B strategic bombers,” it said in a statement. The US aircraft did not cross the border and the fighter jets returned to their home airfield, it added. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. Ukraine said on Thursday that it would open more embassies in Africa, as it announced its intention to stage a historic summit with leaders from the continent. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, made the comments in a statement to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (now the African Union). He said: We have recently adopted our first African strategy and intensified our political dialogue with many countries on the continent. This year, we are going to establish new embassies in different parts of the continent and plan to hold the first Ukraine-Africa Summit. I invite the leaders of your countries to take part in this important event. In a lower section, the address read: “We are hearing calls for peace from various countries and leaders. We support them as such and think they need to be directed first and foremost to Russia as the country that started this war.” Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president, confirmed on Thursday that the relocation of some tactical nuclear weapons from Russia to Belarus had already started, the Russian state-owned news agency Tass reports. Russia signed a deal with its close ally Belarus earlier on Thursday about the storage of the warheads at a special facility that should be finished in just over a month’s time. It is unclear at this stage how many nuclear weapons would be kept in Belarus. Tactical nuclear weapons are intended to destroy enemy troops and weapons on the battlefield, and have a relatively short range. Speaking in Moscow, Lukashenko said “the movement of the nuclear weapons has begun,” AP reports, but he was not clear whether any actually had arrived in his country. Lukashenko, who sparked rumours of being seriously ill when he cut short a Victory Day appearance in Red Square on 9 May before resurfacing in public on 15 May, was attending a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council with Vladimir Putin and the leaders of Armenia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plan for the nuclear deployment, Moscow’s first outside Russia’s borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, was announced by Putin in an interview with state television on 25 March. The Russian president has said the west is fighting an escalating proxy war against Russia. The US government believes Russia has about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, which include bombs that can be carried by aircraft, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery rounds, AP reports. The Danish foreign ministry has confirmed that its ambassador had been summoned by Russia over the Nord Stream investigation (See 12:34), and said authorities in Denmark, Germany and Sweden were continuing their investigations, Reuters reports. “Denmark has been providing ongoing updates to Russia regarding the investigation’s progress and responding to their inquiries. We will continue to do so,” the ministry said in an email. Unverified footage appears to show a drone speedboat attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs in the Black Sea on Wednesday. The video appears to show at least one of the drones getting extremely close to the ship, though it remains unclear whether or not any damage was done. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and Denmark to protest over what it said was the “complete lack of results” of an investigation into blasts that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year. The head of the Russian private military contractor Wagner has claimed his forces have started pulling out of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine and handing over control to the Russian military. Ukrainian forces still have a foothold in the south-western outskirts, Hanna Maliar, the deputy minister of defence, said. Russia and Belarus signed a deal formalising the procedure for deploying Russian nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, AP reported. Control of the weapons will remain with Moscow. Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after reports claimed that emergency services had been called to the building. Russian forces carried out overnight drone attacks on Kyiv, officials said on Thursday, continuing a month-long campaign of air strikes against the Ukrainian capital. The European Commission has repeated calls for China to play a constructive role in establishing peace in Ukraine, Reuters reports. “The EU expects China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, to play a constructive role (...) and to recall the necessity to respect the principles of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity (...) by unconditionally withdrawing all forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders,” the EU said in a statement on Thursday. Last week, Li Hui, China’s special representative for Eurasian Affairs and former ambassador to Russia, visited Ukraine and met Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a European tour that Beijing billed as its effort to promote peace talks and a political settlement. He is set to visit Russia on Friday. Finland will provide Ukraine with additional military aid worth around €109m, with the package containing ammunition and anti-aircraft weapons, Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential office, has been quoted by the Kyiv Post as saying. Finland is also among the European countries helping Ukraine defend itself on the battlefield, sending Leopard tanks to assist in combat. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinisto, for the military package, which he says is “urgently needed on the battlefield”. Zelenskiy tweeted: I thank Finland and President @niinisto personally for the prompt implementation of our agreements reached in Helsinki. The 16th package of defense assistance to Ukraine, which will include anti-aircraft systems and ammunition, is urgently needed on the battlefield. Together to victory! Anton Gerashchenko, a former minister and adviser to Ukraine’s interior minitry, has shared an unverified clip that purports to show a drone attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs yesterday. Russia claimed on Wednesday it had repelled three unmanned vessels that attempted to strike the reconnaissance ship in the Black Sea, but the video appears to show that at least one of the drones got extremely close to the ship, even though it remains unclear if any damage was caused. On Wednesday, the Russian ministry of defence issued this statement: Today at 05:30am, the Ukrainian armed forces made an unsuccessful attempt to attack the Ivan Khurs ship of the Black Sea fleet with three unmanned speedboats. [The Ivan Khurs] is performing tasks to ensure the safety of the operation of the Turkish Stream and Blue Stream gas pipelines in the exclusive economic zone of the Republic of Turkey. All enemy boats were destroyed by fire from the standard armament of a Russian ship 140km north-east of the Bosphorus. The ship Ivan Khurs of the Black Sea fleet continues to fulfil its tasks. The chair of Ukraine’s parliament has offered words of reconciliation over second world war-era mass murders that have strained relations with its neighbour and strategic ally Poland for 80 years. Ruslan Stefanchuk told Polish lawmakers that the two countries should work together to identify and honour Polish victims buried in Ukraine, sounding a new tone in contrast to the recent angry reaction of Ukraine’s ambassador to Polish expectations of an apology. About 100,000 Poles were massacred in 1943-44 by Ukrainian nationalists and others in Volhynia and other regions that were then in eastern Poland, under Nazi German occupation, and which are now part of Ukraine. “Human life has equal value, regardless of nationality, race, sex or religion,” Stefanchuk told Polish lawmakers. “With this awareness we will cooperate with you, dear Polish friends, and we will accept the truth regardless of how uncompromising it may be.” Poland this year is marking the 80th anniversary of the 1943-44 massacre. Entire villages were burned down and all their inhabitants killed by the nationalists. Poland calls the events a genocide. An estimated 15,000 Ukrainians died in retaliation. Associated Press reports Stefanchuk thanked the families of the victims for cultivating a memory that “does not call for revenge or hatred, but which serves as a warning that nothing like that can ever happen between our nations again”. He said identification and honoring of the victims “without bans or barriers” is “our joint moral and Christian obligation.” Poland’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Łukasz Jasina, had last week said that on the 80th anniversary Poland was expecting an apology from Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Ukraine’s ambassador to Poland, Vasyl Zvarych, reacted by saying that any suggestions of what Kyiv or Zelenskiy should do were “unacceptable and unfortunate”. Here are some of the latest pictures from Bakhmut. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian private military contractor Wagner, claimed on Thursday that his forces had started pulling out of the city. Ukraine, which denies that Bakhmut has fallen to Russia, insisted it still controlled a “micro district” of the devastated city and said it was still advancing on the flanks, AFP reports. There has been an update on the reports of the alleged detention of two Ukrainian saboteurs who were plotting to blow up power pylons of nuclear power stations in Russia (See 06:56am): The Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said the saboteurs working for Ukrainian foreign intelligence had laid explosives on 11 pylons of the Leningrad and Kalinin nuclear power stations. “The plan of the Ukrainian special services was to prompt the shutdown of the nuclear reactors, disrupt the operation of the nuclear power plants and cause serious economic and reputation damage to the Russian Federation,” the FSB said in a statement. The attacks were due to take place on the eve of the 9 May anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany, added the FSB, which said the saboteurs had been recruited in 2022 by Ukraine’s foreign intelligence service. These claims could not be independently verified. The Leningrad station, located on the Gulf of Finland close to St Petersburg, is Russia’s biggest atomic power plant. The Kalinin nuclear power station is 350km north of Moscow. Ukraine has secured the release of 106 captured soldiers in a prisoner exchange with Russia on Thursday, according to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff. The soldiers, including eight officers, were captured fighting in the devastated eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut that Russia says it has captured, but where Kyiv’s forces claim they still have a small foothold, Reuters reports. “Every one of them is a hero of our state. Many of the ones we are returning from captivity were considered missing. The relatives of these people have gone through a difficult time,” said Andriy Yermak, the senior official. There was no immediate information available about the forces Russia received from Ukraine in exchange. Here is some more reporting on the exchange from The Kyiv Independent: Russia’s foreign ministry said on Thursday it had summoned the ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and Denmark to protest over what it said was the “complete lack of results” of an investigation into blasts that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September last year. In a statement, the ministry accused all three countries of trying to conceal who was behind the blasts, adding that it was unhappy about what it called the opaque nature of the investigation and its refusal to engage with Russia. According to a UN report, the three underwater explosions that ruptured the gas link between Russia and Germany north-east and south-east of the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm on 26 September 2022 were equivalent to the power of several hundred kilograms of explosives. The destruction of three of the four Nord Stream pipelines, which had stopped transporting gas at the point of the blasts, has been the subject of intense speculation. The blasts occurred in the economic zones of Sweden and Denmark and both countries have said the explosions were deliberate, but have yet to determine who was responsible. The two countries and Germany have been investigating the incident. Japan scrambled jet fighters after spotting Russian military planes over the Pacific Ocean and Sea of Japan on Thursday, the defence ministry said. It detected one Russian information-gathering aircraft IL-20 flying round-trip from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Pacific and another IL-20 flying toward the waters near Sado Island before turning toward the continent, Reuters quotes the ministry as saying. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. The EU agreed on Thursday to suspend restrictions on imports from Ukraine for a further year after warding off an import ban on grain imposed by some EU nations, Reuters reports. The Council of the EU, the grouping of EU governments, said in a tweet that EU ministers responsible for trade had agreed to the extension at a meeting on Thursday. The EU lifted tariffs and other restrictions for an initial 12 months in June 2022. In reaction to the news, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged for the “temporary liberalisation” to become permanent, as he continues to seek EU accession for Ukraine. He tweeted: As we move towards the EU, this temporary liberalization should become permanent – without any exceptions or restrictions. I am grateful to all EU members for their support, which brings us closer to the EU accession. Last month, EU governments agreed to extend the suspension of duties and quotas on imports from Ukraine by a year to help its economy during the war with Russia. Ukraine gained EU candidacy status in 2022 at record speed, but while it was an initial step to membership, the process usually takes many years to complete. In addition to Russia announcing on Thursday that five Swedish diplomats are to be expelled from the country (See 09:46), Moscow has additionally announced its decision to close its consulate in Gothenburg, Sweden, in September, Reuters reports. We reported earlier (See 10:27) that Russia is said to have replaced Wagner private military units with regular troops in the outskirts of Bakhmut, the Ukrainian mining city that has been largely devastated by a year of deadly fighting. Reuters has new quotes from Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, who had an update after reports of Wagner forces withdrawing from the eastern Ukrainian city and handing over their positions to regular Russian troops. Maliar wrote in comments on the Telegram app: “In Bakhmut’s outskirts, the enemy has replaced Wagner units with regular army forces. Inside the city itself Wagner fighters remain.” She also said that Ukrainian forces still have a foothold in the south-western outskirts of the city. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern military command, claimed that the number of Russian attacks in the area had fallen in the last three days, and that there had been two military engagements in the last 24 hours, though shelling continued. You can read more on the fighting raging in Bakhmut here: Unverified footage of drones being shot down over Kyiv last night has been posted by Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine. He tweeted: Another sleepless night for many of us. Another attack on Kyiv. We hold on, go to work in the morning, thankful to our air defense and all our friends who keep Ukraine in their hearts and bring our Victory closer. Russia unleashed a barrage of drones against Kyiv in its 12th nighttime air assault on the Ukrainian capital this month, but the city’s air defences shot all of them down, Ukrainian authorities claimed on Thursday. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I’ll be running the blog until 7pm (UK time). Please do feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. Russia has replaced its Wagner private military units with regular soldiers in the outskirts of Bakhmut but the group’s fighters remain inside the devastated city, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Thursday. Her comments appeared at least partially to confirm an announcement by Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin that his group had started withdrawing its forces from Bakhmut in east Ukraine and handing over its positions to regular Russian troops. Prigozhin had repeatedly threatened to withdraw troops from the area before it was taken, citing his dispute with the Russian military and defence establishment over supplies of ammunitions. A couple of days ago Prigozhin sarcastically suggested that his mercenary troops could be replaced by “a battalion of generals”. Yesterday he warned of a new revolution in Russia if leaders did not improve their handling of the war. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak sought to downplay the idea that there was a counter-offensive coming from Ukraine that would be marked by a single significant shift of gear. He wrote: “Once again about the counter-offensive. This is not a ‘single event’ that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon. These are dozens of different actions to destroy the Russian occupation forces in different directions, which have already been taking place yesterday, are taking place today and will continue tomorrow.” Ukraine’s defence ministry claimed to have shot down 36 out of 36 Shahad drones launched into Ukraine by Russia overnight. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that some areas of Chernivtsi were left without power after lines were damaged by falling drone debris. The Russian-imposed head of Crimea’s administration said on Thursday that air defences had downed six drones overnight in different areas of the region. There were no casualties. Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia’s defence minister has said Belarus remains a “faithful ally and reliable partner” to Russia in the face of western states doing “everything possible … to prolong and escalate the armed conflict in Ukraine” as the two countries signed an agreement on the positioning of nuclear weapons in Belarus. During a visit to Minsk Sergei Shoigu said “deploying nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus does not transfer it to the republic control over it, and the decision on its use remains with Moscow”. Overnight the New York Times has reported that US intelligence officials believe that Ukraine was responsible for the drone attack which slightly damaged the Kremlin, and which Russia labelled an assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin, despite the Russian president not being in the building at the time. Kremlin spokesperson Dimitry Peskov said Russia had always held Kyiv responsible, and that it didn’t really matter exactly which Ukrainian units were behind it. Podolyak on Thursday responded by saying Ukraine had nothing to do with the “strange and pointless” attack. The US ambassador to Ukraine has criticised Russia over its implementation of the newly extended Black Sea grain initiative. Bridget Brink tweeted: “After repeated threats to withdraw from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, Russia now refuses to allow any of the waiting 28 ships into Pivdennyi, one of the three ports designated by the agreement for food exports – a clear violation of their commitment. Russia must stop obstructing the operations of this life-saving initiative.” Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after users on social media and reports in the local Tass news agency said emergency services had been called to the building. State-owned Tass initially reported on a fire at the ministry early on Thursday morning, but later reported the ministry saying there was none. Earlier today Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak sought to downplay the idea that there was a counteroffensive coming from Ukraine that would mark a significant shift of gear. He tweeted: Once again about the counteroffensive. Without further questions. 1. This is not a “single event” that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon. 2. These are dozens of different actions to destroy the #Russian occupation forces in different directions, which have already been taking place yesterday, are taking place today and will continue tomorrow. 3. Intensive destruction of enemy logistics is also a counteroffensive. However, as my colleague Dan Sabbagh, our defence and security editor, notes: “Except, at some point, Ukrainian ground forces will need to attack with sufficient combat mass …” Russia has replaced its Wagner private military units with regular soldiers in the outskirts of Bakhmut but the group’s fighters remain inside the devastated city, deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Thursday. Her comments appeared at least partially to confirm an announcement by Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin that his group had started withdrawing its forces from Bakhmut in east Ukraine and handing over its positions to regular Russian troops. Yesterday, Julian Borger reported for the Guardian from Kyiv that Progozhin had said that 20,000 of its fighters have been killed in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. He also warned that Russia could face another revolution if its leadership does not improve its handling of the war. Prigozhin pointed to the social disparity underlined by the war, with the sons of the poor being sent back from the front in zinc coffins while the children of the elite “shook their arses” in the sun. “This divide can end as in 1917 with a revolution,” he said in an interview posted on his channel on the Telegram messaging app. “First the soldiers will stand up, and after that – their loved ones will rise up. There are already tens of thousands of them – relatives of those killed. And there will probably be hundreds of thousands – we cannot avoid that.” Reuters reports Russian prosecutors have asked a court to recognise crimes committed by Nazi Germany in the Moscow region during the second world war as a genocide against the peoples of the Soviet Union. Russia said on Thursday it would expel five Swedish diplomats in what it said was a retaliatory measure for Sweden’s “confrontational course” in relations with Russia. The Russian foreign ministry said it was responding to the expulsion of five of its diplomatic staff from Sweden last month, which it called an “openly hostile step”. Relations between the two countries have worsened since Sweden last year announced its intention to join Nato after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Reuters reports the Russian statement said ties had “reached an unprecedented low”. A senior Ukrainian presidential aide said on Thursday that Ukraine had nothing to do with a “strange and pointless” drone attack on the Kremlin and played down the findings of two US media reports. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, told Reuters in a statement that Russia was trying to reduce arms supplies to Kyiv by playing on western fears of a possible escalation because of alleged Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil. The New York Times reported that assessments by US spy agencies showed that a drone attack on the Kremlin this month was probably orchestrated by one of Ukraine’s special military or intelligence units. Moscow blames the attack on Ukraine. The US ambassador to Ukraine has criticised Russia over its implementation of the newly extended Black Sea grain initiative. Bridget Brinktweeted: After repeated threats to withdraw from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, Russia now refuses to allow any of the waiting 28 ships into Pivdennyi, one of the three ports designated by the agreement for food exports – a clear violation of their commitment. Russia must stop obstructing the operations of this life-saving initiative. Russia’s defence minister has said Belarus remains a “faithful ally and reliable partner” to Russia in the face of western states doing “everything possible … to prolong and escalate the armed conflict in Ukraine”. Russia launched part of its full-scale invasion and failed attempt to capture Kyiv from Belarusian soil in February 2022, in what it termed a “special military operation”. In statements published on Telegram by Russia’s ministry of defence, Sergei Shoigu is quoted as saying his meetings with his Belarusian counterpart have become more regular, saying: This is especially important in the context of the rapid growth of tension, the destruction of the foundations of strategic stability and the unprecedented intensification of international confrontation. Everything possible is being done to prolong and escalate the armed conflict in Ukraine, which is receiving all kinds of military support. The Republic of Belarus has been and remains our faithful ally and reliable partner. Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson has said of reports in the New York Times that Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin that “it doesn’t make much difference which of the units of the Kyiv regime is behind it”. Reuters reports Dmitry Peskov told the media: “We immediately said that the Kyiv regime was behind this.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, denied at the time that Ukraine was responsible. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Tass has more detail on the document signed today concerning arrangements for Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons. On Telegram it quotes Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu saying “deploying nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus does not transfer it to the republic control over it, and the decision on its use remains with Moscow”. It also reports Shoigu noted the measures implemented by Russia and Belarus “comply with all existing international legal obligations”. Tass writes: Russian president Vladimir Putin said on 25 March that Russia, at the request of the Belarusian side, would deploy its tactical nuclear weapons in the republic, as the US has long done on the territory of its allies. According to the head of the Russian state, on 1 July it is planned to complete the construction of a storage facility for tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. Moscow has already handed over to Minsk the Iskander missile system, which can be a carrier of nuclear weapons, and has assisted in re-equipping Belarusian aircraft to be able to use special ammunition. Belarusian servicemen have undergone appropriate training in the Russian Federation. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has started withdrawing its forces from the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, its founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said in a video published on Thursday, Reuters reports. Prigozhin had repeatedly threatened to withdraw troops from the area before it was taken, citing his dispute with the Russian military and defence establishment over supplies of ammunitions. A couple of days ago Prigozhin sarcastically suggested that his mercenary troops could be replaced by “a battalion of generals”. The defence ministers of Russia and Belarus on Thursday signed a document on the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported. Separately, citing Russian media, Reuters reported that the Russia defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the west was waging an “undeclared war” against Russia and Belarus. Shoigu is in Minsk for a meeting of the Council of Ministers of Defense of the CSTO member states, which include Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Russia and Belarus, which are close allies over the conflict in Ukraine, agreed earlier this year to deploy part of Moscow’s tactical nuclear arsenal in Belarus. Russia launched its failed attempt to capture Kyiv from Belarusian territory last year. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, offers this update on the overnight situation, writing on its official Telegram channel: At night, air defence forces destroyed 36 of the 36 ‘Shahed’ drones that Russia launched over Ukraine, the air force reported. Also at night, the Russian military struck Tsyrkuny in the Kharkiv region. The S-300 missile hit the ground. A private house was damaged, there were no injuries. In the Chernivtsi region, two power lines were damaged as a result of the fall of the drone debris – part of the Dnipro district was cut off. Three residential buildings were damaged. Yesterday, the Russian army shelled the Kherson region 83 times: four people were injured. The claims have not been independently verified. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, one of the occupied regions of the Donbas which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed, has posted to Telegram to state that in the last 24 hours one person has been killed and six injured by Russian shelling in the region. He listed a number of locations where houses and infrastructure had been destroyed, including Horlivka, Chasiv Yar and Kostiantynivka. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian-imposed head of Crimea’s administration said on Thursday that air defences had downed six drones overnight in different areas of the region. There were no casualties, Reuters reports Sergei Aksyonov said on Telegram. Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Overnight the New York Times has reported that US intelligence officials believe that Ukraine was responsible for the drone attack which slightly damaged the Kremlin, and which Russia labelled an assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin, despite the Russian president not being in the building at the time. It writes: US officials said the drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month was likely orchestrated by one of Ukraine’s special military or intelligence units, the latest in a series of covert actions against Russian targets that have unnerved the Biden administration. US intelligence agencies do not know which unit carried out the attack and it was unclear whether President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine or his top officials were aware of the operation. The New York Times goes on to say: US officials say their level of confidence that the Ukrainian government directly authorised the Kremlin drone attack is “low” but that is because intelligence agencies do not yet have specific evidence identifying which government officials, Ukrainian units or operatives were involved. The attack appeared to be part of a series of operations that have made officials in the US – Ukraine’s biggest supplier of military equipment – uncomfortable. The Biden administration is concerned about the risk that Russia will blame US officials and retaliate by expanding the war beyond Ukraine. American spy agencies see an emerging picture of a loose confederation of Ukrainian units able to conduct limited operations inside and outside Russia, either by using their own personnel or partners working under their direction. Some of these missions could have been conducted with little, if any, oversight from Zelenskiy, officials said. At the time, Zelenskiy said “We didn’t attack Putin or Moscow”, as he addressed journalists during a visit to Helsinki. Russia’s FSB security service says it has detained two Ukrainian saboteurs who were plotting to blow up power pylons of nuclear power stations in Russia, Reuters reports, citing Russian state-owned news agency RIA. More on that story now: Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, which says Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped ignite a boom in clean energy investment,said: “Clean energy is moving fast – faster than many people realise. This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels. “In very simple, but very striking terms, five years ago global energy investment was $2tn, of which $1tn was for clean energy and $1tn was for fossil fuels. Today, $1tn is for fossil fuels and $1.7tn is for clean energy. This is a dramatic shift which will have consequences for the energy markets and climate change. In my view, it’s very exciting.” The clean energy boom is particularly apparent in solar power investment, Birol said. “For the first time in history the amount of investment going to solar is higher than the amount going to oil production. It may be symbolic but it is very important because it shows the tide turning,” he said. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped ignite a boom in clean energy investment which will significantly outpace spending on fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. A report from the IEA has found that clean energy investment is on track to reach $1.7tn (£1.4tn) this year as investors turn to renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, storage and other low-carbon technologies. Investment in coal, gas and oil will rise to just over $1tn, the IEA said. The Paris-based agency found that clean energy investments have been boosted by many factors including periods of strong economic growth and volatile fossil fuel prices as well as heightened concerns about energy security after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: A second fire, which appeared to be unrelated, broke out at a market in Akos, in the Moscow region on Wednesday evening. Russia’s emergency services said on Telegram that the fire had increased from 500 sq metres to 1,800 sq metres and had been localised. No victims were reported. Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after users on social media and reports in the local Tass news agency said emergency services had been called to the building. Tass initially reported on a fire at the ministry early on Thursday morning, saying: “The fire broke out in the building of the Ministry of Defense of Russia in the centre of Moscow.” They cited an unnamed government source and said “a fire broke out on one of the balconies.” Emergency services were on the scene, the source told Tass. Almost an hour later, the news agency published a second story saying: “The Ministry of Emergency Situations did not detect a fire in the building of the Ministry of Defense in Moscow, the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Russian Federation for Moscow told reporters on Thursday.” Both stories were still up on the website at 5am Thursday, Moscow time. Unverified video circulated on social media early on Thursday showing smoke emerging from the ministry building. In one video of the building seen by CNN, a woman could be heard saying: “The smell of burning is horrible.” Denis Kapustin, Russian commander of a militia that conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week was asked repeatedly about Western media reports that his militia had used US military equipment that was meant to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s invasion, but declined to answer directly. “I know exactly where I got my weapons from. Unfortunately not from the Western partners”, he said. Washington is looking into reports that American vehicles were used by Ukraine inside Russia, the White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. He said the US has been clear with Kyiv that it does not support any such use of US-made equipment. The Russian commander of a militia that conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week said on Wednesday his group would soon launch more incursions into Russian territory. Denis Kapustin, who described himself as the commander of the Russian Volunteer Corps, spoke to reporters on the Ukrainian side of the border with Russia a day after Moscow said it had repelled the raid on the Belgorod region. Kyiv has said the attack was carried out by Russian citizens, casting it as homegrown, internal Russian strife. Two groups operating in Ukraine – the Russian Volunteer Corps and Freedom of Russia Legion - have claimed responsibility. “I think you will see us again on that side,” said Kapustin, who introduced himself by his call-sign White Rex. “I cannot reveal those upcoming things, I cannot even reveal the direction. The ... border is pretty long. Yet again there will be a spot where things will get hot.” Russian forces carried out overnight drone attacks on Kyiv, officials said Thursday, continuing a month-long campaign of air strikes against the Ukrainian capital. Via AFP: Military chiefs said Kyiv’s air defences destroyed all of the drones during the three-hour air attack, the twelfth this month. Serhiy Popko, head of the city’s military administration, said in a message on Telegram that Russia “again attacked Kyiv from the air”. “The attack was massive,” the statement added. “The enemy continues to use attack tactics in several waves, with intervals between groups of attacking drones.” He added that “all detected air targets moving in the direction of Kyiv were destroyed” by Ukrainian air defence systems. The attacks were carried out using Iranian-made Shahed drones, the statement added, citing preliminary information. Air alerts were also reported in the cities of Kharkiv and Chernivtsi. Welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Our top stories this morning: The Russian commander of a militia that conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week said on Wednesday his group would soon launch more incursions into Russian territory. And Russian forces carried out overnight drone attacks on Kyiv, officials said Thursday, continuing a month-long campaign of airstrikes against the Ukrainian capital. Military chiefs said Kyiv’s air defences destroyed all of the drones during the three-hour air attack, the twelfth this month. Here are the other key developments: Washington is looking into reports that American vehicles were used by Ukraine inside Russia, the White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. He said the US has been clear with Kyiv that it does not support any such use of US-made equipment. The Kremlin said the use of US-made military hardware by pro-Ukraine fighters who conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week was testament to the West’s growing involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The Russian military said on Tuesday it had routed militants who attacked the Russian border region of Belgorod with armoured vehicles the previous day, killing more than 70 “Ukrainian nationalists” and pushing the remainder back into Ukraine. In Belgorod, nine people remain in hospital, utility supplies continue to be disrupted, and more than 500 people remain displaced after the cross-border incursion by anti-Russian partisans on Monday, according to Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Russian region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Iranians on Wednesday to reconsider the supply of deadly drones to Russia. Iranian-made Shahed drones supplied to Moscow have played a major role in Russia’s attacks on cities and infrastructure. “The simple question is this: what is your interest in being an accomplice to Russian terror?” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. “What is the benefit to Iran of such cynical killing?” Ukraine will not be able to join Nato as long as the war is going on, the alliance’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Wednesday. “I think that everyone realised that, to become a member in the midst of a war, is not on the agenda,” Reuters reports he said at an event organised by the German Marshall Fund of the US in Brussels. “The issue is what happens when the war ends.” The Russian private army Wagner lost 20,000 fighters in the drawn-out battle for Bakhmut, according to the group’s chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin. He said about 20% of the 50,000 Russian prisoners recruited to fight in the 15-month war had died in the eastern Ukrainian city, and a similar number of its regular troop. The figure was in stark contrast with claims from Moscow that it has lost just over 6,000 troops in the war, and is higher than the official estimate of the Soviet losses in the Afghanistan war of 15,000 troops between 1979 and 1989. The World Health Organization assembly passed a motion on Wednesday condemning Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, including attacks on healthcare facilities. The motion passed by 80 votes to nine, with 52 abstentions and 36 countries absent, Reuters reported. The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development expects to spend €1.5bn (£1.3bn) in Ukraine next year in support of infrastructure and the economy, a senior source at the bank has said. It comes on top of €3bn already projected for 2022 and the remainder of 2023. The funds have helped the economy continue to function and ensure that there was no run on banks and that civil servants continued to be paid. The European Union has discussed sending Ukraine the profits from €196.6bn of Russian assets that are stuck inside the plumbing of global financial markets, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service, has accused Washington and London of thwarting efforts to reach a settlement over the conflict in Ukraine and of turning a blind eye to what he said was increasing “terrorism and violence” visited on civilians by Ukraine. The first of three Russian hypersonic missile scientists to be arrested on suspicion of treason will go on trial next week, the court handling the case said on Wednesday. The criminal case against Anatoly Maslov, 76, will open in St Petersburg’s city court on 1 June, the court said on its website. The Netherlands wants to give Ukrainian pilots F-16 training as soon as possible, the Dutch defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, said on Wednesday in a letter to parliament. The training would be coordinated with Belgium, Denmark and the United Kingdom, and other countries could join, Ollongren added. Russia has announced that a court in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don will try five foreign men, including three British nationals, accused of fighting alongside Ukrainian forces against Moscow. The trial will begin on 31 May on terrorism-linked allegations and other charges. The men are believed to face trial in absentia. Ukraine’s main Orthodox church said on Wednesday it had decided to switch to a calendar in which Christmas is celebrated on 25 December, a move that distances it from Russia. Ukrainian Christians, a majority of whom are Orthodox, have traditionally celebrated Christmas on 7 January alongside other predominantly Orthodox Christian countries. Germany will buy 18 Leopard 2 tanks and 12 self-propelled howitzers to replenish stocks depleted by deliveries to Ukraine, a member of the parliamentary budget committee that approved the purchase on Wednesday told Reuters. The tanks order will come to €525.6m (£457m) while the howitzers have a price tag of €190.7m; all of them are to be delivered by 2026 at the latest, said the finance ministry documents meant for the parliament."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/oct/07/ardern-hails-zero-emissions-buses-in-labour-election-pledge-on-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-10-07T03:38:12Z","webTitle":"Ardern hails zero-emissions buses in Labour election pledge on climate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/07/ardern-hails-zero-emissions-buses-in-labour-election-pledge-on-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/oct/07/ardern-hails-zero-emissions-buses-in-labour-election-pledge-on-climate","fields":{"headline":"Ardern hails zero-emissions buses in Labour election pledge on climate","bodyText":"Jacinda Ardern says she would help bring in to zero-emissions buses in a bid to decarbonise public transport if her Labour government were returned to power in New Zealand’s election on 17 October. In Ardern’s emissions policy, announced on Wednesday, her party also pledged to phase out coal-fired boilers commonly used for small-scale heating, and to boost funding for agricultural climate change research programmes. “I have said that climate change is my generation’s ‘nuclear-free moment’,” Ardern said in a statement. She added that her government, which has held office since 2017, had taken “the most concrete actions” on climate of any to date. “But there is more to do,” she said. Labour would spend $50m to help local councils buy only zero-emissions buses by 2025. Her government would “decarbonise the public transport bus fleet” by 2030, she added. Ardern’s party would also legislate to stop the installation of low- and medium-temperature coal-fired boilers, she said, which would be replaced with electric alternatives. “During our first term in government, climate change was at the centre of all our policy work and commitments,” Ardern said. “It is inextricably linked to our decisions on issues like housing, agriculture, waste, energy and transport.” Labour has also pledged a transition to 100% renewable electricity by 2030 and incentives for low-emission vehicles. Transport makes up 20% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions and the agriculture sector accounts for nearly half. New Zealand is known worldwide for its picturesque landscapes and so-called “clean, green” brand; many voters have cited concerns about action on the climate crisis and the state of the country’s waterways as key issues ahead of next week’s vote. In November, Ardern’s government – with historic cross-party support – passed a law to reduce New Zealand’s carbon emissions to zero by 2050 and meet the country’s commitments under the Paris climate accords. New education materials were introduced in January to teach school students about the climate crisis. The left-leaning Green party – Labour’s coalition partner – would “go further and faster” than Ardern’s party to “address the true scale of the crisis”, the party’s co-leader James Shaw said in a statement on Wednesday. Shaw, who is also the climate change minister, said the next government needed to “get serious about supporting solar power” and make electric cars more affordable to New Zealanders. Ardern’s Labour received 47% support in a September poll by 1 News Colmar Brunton, with the main opposition party, National, at 33%. The Greens polled at 7%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2020/dec/31/is-the-uk-about-to-have-liftoff-in-the-global-space-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-31T14:51:00Z","webTitle":"Is the UK about to have liftoff in the global space industry?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/dec/31/is-the-uk-about-to-have-liftoff-in-the-global-space-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2020/dec/31/is-the-uk-about-to-have-liftoff-in-the-global-space-industry","fields":{"headline":"Is the UK about to have liftoff in the global space industry?","bodyText":"In 1969, a British engineer was invited to the White House to meet President Nixon. His name was Francis Thomas Bacon and he had developed the fuel cells used on Apollo 11. Known now as Bacon fuel cells, these power sources consume hydrogen and oxygen to produce water, heat and, in theory, a continuous supply of electricity. His invention was considered so integral to the success of the Apollo mission that Nixon told him, “Without you Tom, we wouldn’t have gotten to the moon.” Bacon is one of many heroes in the history of Britain in space. The UK was the world’s third ever space-faring nation, after the USSR and US. And in the years after Apollo, several UK space companies, including Inmarsat and Surrey Satellite Technology, were created, building on the work of these early British space engineers. Over the last 50 years, however, few would describe Britain as a truly global space superpower. While the UK has much expertise in developing and producing satellites, it has less experience launching them. Britain has not independently launched a satellite of its own since 1971. Only 5% of the 2,600 satellites in orbit today are registered to the UK. Yet over the last decade, space has proved to be one of the UK’s fastest growing sectors. It has trebled in size since 2010. Today the UK space industry employs almost 42,000 people and generates an income of £15bn every year. More than £300bn of wider UK GDP is supported by satellite services, including telecoms, metrology, earth observation and navigation. The UK’s ongoing membership of the European Space Agency (Esa) will not be affected by Brexit. Esa is not an EU institution. But the UK’s departure from the EU will impact to varying degrees the UK’s involvement in European space programmes. These include the satellite navigation programme Galileo, Copernicus Earth Observation and the EU Space Surveillance and Tracking programme. The government wants the UK to be the most attractive place in Europe for those looking to launch into orbit and beyond. The global small satellite launch market is worth about £400bn. The UK wants 10% of that market by 2030. To achieve this, the UK will need the ability to launch its own satellites into space. That’s why the UK is investing in a number of spaceports (think airports but for rockets) across the country. Most recently, the government gave the green light for Lockheed Martin to transfer its small satellite launch operations to the Shetland Space Centre on the Scottish island of Unst. The Shetlands have a number of qualities that make them ideal for getting to space. Their northern latitude provides easy access to polar orbits, good for low earth, small satellites. And their remoteness allows launches to be directed over the sea, away from heavily populated areas. Shetland is not the only area in the UK to have increased investment in space. Spaceports are also being developed in Cornwall and Sutherland. The government also announced this year the development of new “space hubs” across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each will use government funding to bring together local authority expertise and business to create a strategy for how that area can take advantage of the commercial space race. And with the ability to launch its own satellites into space at lower cost, the UK is also hoping to build on its legacy of innovation in space. In 1941, the writer Isaac Asimov imagined giant solar panels positioned in space, capable of capturing the sun’s rays and beaming them down to earth and the grid. That was fiction. But last month, the government commissioned new research to understand what it would take to make space-based solar power a reality. For the first time, the technology (including lightweight solar panels and wireless power transmission) and the economics (lower cost space launches) make this a possibility. Bacon’s fuel cells, provided they have a continuous source of hydrogen and oxygen, offered a continuous supply of electricity. In space, where the sun never sets, solar panels, offer the promise of a continuous supply of renewable energy. They represent one example of a potentially gamechanging innovation as the UK charts its next 50 years in space."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jul/16/australias-sun-tax-solar-energy-supporters-split-over-how-to-make-electricity-grid-fairer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-07-16T20:00:41Z","webTitle":"Australia’s ‘sun tax’: solar energy supporters split over how to make electricity grid fairer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/16/australias-sun-tax-solar-energy-supporters-split-over-how-to-make-electricity-grid-fairer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jul/16/australias-sun-tax-solar-energy-supporters-split-over-how-to-make-electricity-grid-fairer","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s ‘sun tax’: solar energy supporters split over how to make electricity grid fairer","bodyText":"Michael Streatfeild was an early solar adopter. About a decade ago he withdrew $15,000 from his mortgage to install a 3.6kW system of panels on a north-east facing section of his roof in western Sydney. Three years ago, in a bid to wipe out his reliance on coal-fired grid electricity, he added a 4kW system and positioned it to catch sun later in the day, when it comes from the north-west. The sharp fall in the cost of solar in recent years meant the second system, though bigger than the first, cost just $5,000, a third of what he paid in 2011. Together, the two systems have all but wiped out his electricity bills – his last two brought refunds of about $100. Streatfeild is part of a rapidly expanding Australian story. About 2.8m households have solar systems, with another 3m expected to join them over the next decade. The flood of solar energy those houses create in the middle of the day when the sun is high is rapidly and dramatically transforming the electricity grid. At peak moments, slightly more than half the electricity across the national market is now from renewable sources, compared with about 30% across the year. In his first speech this week, the new head of the energy market operator, Daniel Westerman, set a target of the entire grid being able to run entirely on renewable energy, at least for brief moments, by 2025. According to regulators and some analysts, this solar influx, while welcome, is also causing potential problems by creating “traffic jams” in a system that was largely designed to send energy from a few large generators to homes and businesses. This prompted the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) in March to propose a change that could give network providers the power to charge people who export electricity into the grid at times when it is not needed. It argued the change was necessary to make room for more household solar systems and batteries to be connected to the grid, and to make the system fairer for all users. The commission, which makes rules for the electricity system, suggested two-way pricing that better rewarded solar and battery owners who send power to the grid at peak times – the early evening, for example. It also recommended new incentives that would give customers more reason to buy batteries or electric vehicles, or set up their homes to consume the power they generate at busy times. The proposal has proved divisive, pitting against each other those who want to see a rapid expansion of solar but who have different views about what is required to get there. From Streatfeild’s perspective, the potential new impost is unreasonable, but not surprising. A former police officer and member of the advocacy group Solar Citizens, he says he was motivated to get panels by the climate stance of the then opposition leader Tony Abbott and thoughts about the future his grandchildren faced. “I wanted to be able to say to them, ‘I didn’t fuck this Earth up for you, I did the best I could’,” Streatfeild says. He believes big electricity generators and networks have a history of profiteering and should bear any transformation costs, while solar consumers should be rewarded for bringing down the wholesale electricity price by undercutting ageing – and increasingly unviable – coal-fired power plants. “It’s really bad management by the network operators, in my opinion,” Streatfeild says. “They should have foreseen the need for all this. They seem to just want to screw us again.” Solar Citizens has a similar position. It has labelled the AEMC’s proposal a “sun tax”, and says solar homes and businesses should be rewarded for the benefits they provide, not penalised. “People have invested in solar in good faith,” says Ellen Roberts, Solar Citizens’ national director. “Any time that people have invested in something and the rules change it is breaching a fairness principle.” But arguments over fairness and solar power quickly become complicated – the same principle is invoked by supporters of the AEMC proposal. They say the change is needed in part to ensure a more equitable system for poor households that cannot afford solar panels and therefore bear a greater share of network charges. The AEMC’s draft rule followed proposals from an unlikely collection of groups, including the power distribution company SA Power Networks and welfare organisations the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) and the St Vincent de Paul Society. Kellie Caught, senior adviser on climate and energy for Acoss, says the country needs a rapid transition to renewable electricity, but the question is who pays for it. Roughly a third of households are renting, so they can’t install solar panels and rely more heavily on – and pay more for – the poles and wires provided by electricity networks than those with solar. Caught says people with solar panels did not create the problem regulators are trying to address, but she believes the proposed rule change would benefit both grid security and consumers. “At the moment, the people who can least afford it are carrying more of the network costs,” she says. She says it is important the change empowers consumers with solar by giving them, and not network operators, the choice over whether they pay to export electricity at busy times or just accept a limit on how much they can send to the grid. Dylan McConnell, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne Climate and Energy College, also argues cutting emissions must be prioritised, but socially just. He cites research by the Grattan Institute in 2015 that suggests the effective subsidy paid by non-solar households to those with solar would be $3.6bn out to 2030. McConnell says at the heart of the debate is a question of whether household solar owners have a right to earn revenue by exporting to the grid, given they save money by using their self-generated solar energy at home, and whether that right comes with a responsibility to contribute to the infrastructure changes needed to ensure it is possible. Bruce Mountain, the director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, strongly disagrees. He argues the change proposed by the AEMC is based on a fallacy as the poorest households share the financial benefits of increased solar uptake at a level that far outweighs the additional network costs they face. He also suggests there is no evidence that more solar in the grid in the middle of the day is a problem that could not be addressed at low cost. “There simply isn’t good evidence of a problem to which export charging is a solution,” Mountain says. State governments have raised concerns about the change to varying degrees. Both Victoria and Queensland have indicated they do not support export charges. Some states have suggested grandfathering any cost so it does not affect people who already have panels. Other submissions to the AEMC argue to be effective the change must ensure solar owners who do what it wants – export their electricity when it is most needed – are well rewarded. They say it needs to become attractive to buy a household battery, or an EV that can both draw and export power to the grid. Neither technology has received the level of government support offered for rooftop panels when they were at similar levels of uptake a decade ago. Coincidentally or otherwise, the AEMC this week released a separate draft plan it says will make it easier for small battery owners to send electricity to the grid and earn revenue. The commission argues the average solar household with a system of between 4kW and 6kW will still do well after its proposed rule change. It estimates they will save about $900 a year on power bills – about $70 less than currently – and that households without solar would have their bills reduced as they would no longer have to pay for solar export services they do not use. It says alternatives to introducing an export cost, such as blocking people’s solar exports when the grid is under strain, or building more poles and wires to allow greater solar traffic, would be more expensive for consumers. The former would also have the effect of reducing the amount of renewable energy coming into the grid. The commission’s chief executive and chair, Benn Barr and Anna Collyer, emphasise that the rule change would not mandate an export charge, but allow networks to put forward proposals. The change would start in 2025. Barr says all governments support what he describes as a profound shift – a recognition for the first time that electricity networks need to take power from houses, not just get it to them. “What it means is those businesses now have an incentive and an obligation to upgrade the grid to get more solar, and be ready for when electric vehicles come,” Barr says. “It has kind of got lost a bit, but it will really change the ways those businesses do work, and benefit consumers across Australia.” A final decision on the rule change was initially due earlier this month but is now expected on 12 August."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/dec/26/future-shock-how-will-covid-change-the-course-of-business","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-26T16:00:20Z","webTitle":"Future shock: how will Covid change the course of business?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/26/future-shock-how-will-covid-change-the-course-of-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/dec/26/future-shock-how-will-covid-change-the-course-of-business","fields":{"headline":"Future shock: how will Covid change the course of business?","bodyText":"Coronavirus has changed lives and industries across the UK, accelerating fundamental shifts in behaviour and consumption that were already on their way. Debates about home working, preserving local high streets and the ethics of air travel were bubbling away before coronavirus rampaged across the world, but the consequences of the worst pandemic in more than a century have either settled those arguments or boosted the momentum behind certain lifestyle changes. Here we look at how those debates have been changed – or resolved – by Covid-19. Streaming will take away cinema’s pre-eminence Coronavirus won’t kill cinema, but it will forever change the movie-going experience. This year the global box office is likely to be just a quarter of the record $42bn (£31bn) set in 2019 and UK cinema admissions are set to hit their lowest level since records began. At the start of the pandemic theatre owners were confident that once the virus had been tamed, the blockbusters and their fans would return. However, Hollywood studios, fearful of empty seats making for box office flops, spied an unprecedented chance to bypass cinemas and make films available via streaming services. This has broken the sacrosanct tradition of months of big-screen exclusivity, outraging theatre owners who rely on that model to make their businesses viable. Warner Bros has said its entire slate of 21 films, from Dune to The Suicide Squad, will debut on its streaming service, HBO Max, at the same time as in US cinemas next year. The same thing has already happened to Wonder Woman 1984, which was simultaneously released to US theatres and living rooms on Christmas Day. A precedent has been set over separating cinema release from streaming availability. Cinema still has a role to play. The economics of blockbusters, which cost hundreds of millions to make and distribute, means films of such scale need the multimillion-dollar returns from the big-screen global box office. But in the future it is likely that movie fans will no longer have to wait endless months before streaming the latest blockbuster from their sofa. Mark Sweney Should rail be nationalised? Rail was regarded as a privatisation too far even by Margaret Thatcher, before her Conservative successors went ahead in 1994. Then state spending on the industry vastly increased after Railtrack collapsed and the infrastructure behind it was brought under government control as Network Rail, although the franchise owners who operated the trains remained privately controlled. Private train operators liked to take credit for the passengers who flocked back in record numbers; but most voters still backed nationalisation, polls showed. Even though a decade of intermittent franchising troubles showed reform was desperately needed, and the government had to step in twice to take over the east coast mainline, only Labour under Jeremy Corbyn gave a full-throated commitment to return the rest of rail into public hands. But Covid-19 and lockdown restrictions meant passengers all but disappeared for parts of 2020. Following years of unresolved debate and inquiry over the best format for the industry, franchises were summarily scrapped overnight in March. Emergency contracts are more or less embedded until 2022: the industry now runs on Treasury cash, and is likely to do so for some time to come. British Rail may be history but nonetheless, by July the Office for National Statistics had reclassified the industry as, de facto, renationalised. Gwyn Topham Do we need a third Heathrow runway? At the start of the millennium the Labour government concluded expansion of Heathrow was the answer to airport capacity constraints, granting planning permission which was overturned by the coalition in 2010. After another commission re-examined all the options, a third Heathrow runway was again approved by MPs in 2018. A legal challenge to the policy on environmental grounds was first rejected, then upheld on appeal, before finally being dismissed by the supreme court this month. In the long term, the climate crisis arguments might indeed prove the most compelling. But for now it is coronavirus that has all but swept aside the arguments for expansion. At its peak, Heathrow was constrained to its maximum permitted movements: a plane taking off or landing every 45 seconds, and passenger numbers growing beyond 70 million a year only through bigger, fuller planes. Yet November’s traffic figures showed only a tenth of the usual number of passengers passing through, leaving the airport using only one runway. Given the potential for a permanent decline in long-haul and business travel since the world turned to Zoom, the airport may struggle to present a compelling business case for expansion for some time to come. Gwyn Topham The high street is in terminal decline The tumbleweed bowled down high streets this year as home working supercharged the growth of online shopping, with Debenhams and Topshop-owner Arcadia among the big casualties. And the shift is clear. In the third quarter of this year, 27% of retail sales were online compared with 18% the year before, according to the Office for National Statistics. The pandemic pressed fast-forward on the painful restructuring process of an industry where fewer stores are needed to meet the needs of shoppers in the internet age. With each year more clothing, homeware and food will be bought online. This will create jobs for delivery drivers and in warehouses but not in shops, which employ around 3 million people across the UK. What will happen with these empty stores? Rents have fallen sharply as landlords adjust to the post-pandemic reality, and changed working patterns show how neighbourhoods can blossom when people live and work nearby. This creates opportunities for businesses with the right offer and cost base. For instance, empty department stores are being converted into flats, food halls and crazy-golf courses. The high street is dead, long live the high street – but not as we knew it. Zoe Wood Working from home will replace office life Technology rode to the rescue for British businesses when they had to send their staff home in the spring. High-speed internet, video-conferencing, chatrooms: everything required to work remotely was already widely available. As a result, the year of working from home has generally been considered a great success. Banks are leading the drive for a permanent shift with Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays reviewing the amount of office space they use and Standard Chartered permanently shifting to flexible routines. Google and Facebook, which have substantial workforces in the UK, will embrace partial homeworking permanently. But working from home isn’t without its challenges. The impact on creativity, loss of interaction and serendipitous conversations, and lack of support for younger staff, are all cited as good reasons to return to offices. Workers juggling childcare and their job, and employees living in cramped flats, have also missed their desks. Nonetheless, it appears that home working has been a bigger hit in the UK than elsewhere. British office workers were spending an average of 2.7 days per week at home in November, according to the US bank Morgan Stanley, compared with 2.1 days in France and Italy, and slightly less than that in Germany and Spain. Research found that UK workers spent just over a third (39%) of their working hours in the office in November, lagging the European average of 56%. The trend looks set to continue, with UK employees expected to request flexible working for 2.3 days per week, more than in the other four European nations. Joanna Partridge Renewables can provide the UK’s energy needs Any lingering doubt that the UK’s wind turbines and solar farms can provide a backbone for the electricity system were cast aside during the pandemic as renewable energy set new records through the year. The collapse in energy demand following the lockdown of office blocks, schools and restaurants – combined with the UK’s bright, breezy weather – helped renewable energy make up almost half of all electricity in the early months of the year. New records for solar power and wind generation followed in June and December respectively. Stephen Stead, a director at energy provider SSE, said the low electricity demand levels in 2020 “gave us an unprecedented peek at a future electricity market dominated by renewables – and we learned that we can do it”. Wind and solar power will be able to play an even greater role in the future as investment in battery storage and flexible energy use becomes the norm. But in 2020 renewables proved they are already prepared to exceed expectations. Jillian Ambrose Cash is (eventually) doomed The move to cashless payments accelerated this year, partly because so much spending moved online, and partly because of fears of infection through notes and coins. The contactless limit was raised to £45 and many outlets went cash-free. According to the ATM provider Link, in the first full week of the spring lockdown withdrawals fell by 57% in value compared with the same week in 2019. Numbers went up as restrictions were eased, but by October the value of cash withdrawals was still down by 30% year-on-year. However, throughout the year there have been queues outside banks, and the Bank of England has reported that the value of notes in circulation has increased since March, to approaching £80bn. In the days prior to November’s lockdown, cash withdrawals surged. There is still a core of people who use and depend on cash, and holding physical money seems to be a safety measure for some. Early on in lockdown, a Link survey found 14% consumers were keeping more cash at home in case of emergencies. The decline of cash as a payment method has been speeded up, but there is still a long way to go before we give it up.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects the economic fallout of Covid-19 to wipe out the world’s oil demand growth for the year ahead, which should cap the fossil fuel emissions that contribute to the climate crisis. But Fatih Birol, IEA’s executive director, has warned the outbreak could spell a slowdown in the world’s clean energy transition unless governments use green investments to help support economic growth through the global slowdown. “There is nothing to celebrate in a likely decline in emissions driven by economic crisis because in the absence of the right policies and structural measures this decline will not be sustainable,” he said. The virus has stoked fears of a global economic recession and helped to ignite one of the sharpest oil price collapses in the last 30 years, wiping billions of dollars from the world’s largest energy companies. The economic contagion is likely to stall many infrastructure projects, including the multibillion-dollar investments in clean energy needed to avert a climate catastrophe by the end of the decade. The year ahead could mark the first time the world’s solar power growth falls since the 1980s, according to a report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The analysts on Thursday slashed forecasts for new solar power projects by 8%. It expected sales of electric vehicles to stall too. “We should not allow today’s crisis to compromise the clean energy transition,” Birol said. He said global governments should use the economic stimulus packages which are being planned to help countries weather the downturn to invest in clean energy technologies. He added: “We have an important window of opportunity. Major economies around the world are preparing stimulus packages. A well designed stimulus package could offer economic benefits and facilitate a turnover of energy capital which have huge benefits for the clean energy transition.” The IEA’s analysis has shown 70% of the world’s clean energy investments are government-driven, either through direct government finance or in response to policies such as subsidies or taxes. The watchdog has also found government fossil fuel subsidies total $400bn (£300bn) each year. Birol urged global governments to invest in energy efficiency measures, which might not offer good short-term returns while energy prices are low but would prove a lucrative investment in the longer-term. The IEA head also urged policymakers to use the downturn in global oil prices to phase out or scrap fossil fuels subsidies, which could be used to boost healthcare spending. “These challenging market conditions will be a clear test for government commitments,” he said. “But the good news is that compared to economic stimulus packages of the past we have much cheaper renewable technologies, have made major progress in electric vehicles, and there is a supportive financial community for the clean energy transition. “If the right policies are put in place there are opportunities to make the best of this situation,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/jun/02/uk-electricity-coal-free-for-first-month-ever","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-02T16:25:52Z","webTitle":"Coal - free first for electricity in Great Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/02/uk-electricity-coal-free-for-first-month-ever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/jun/02/uk-electricity-coal-free-for-first-month-ever","fields":{"headline":"Coal - free first for electricity in Great Britain","bodyText":"Great Britain’s electricity system recorded its “greenest” ever month in May after running without coal-fired electricity for a full calendar month. The National Grid, the energy system operator, said the country’s sunniest spring on record helped generate enough solar power to reduce the carbon intensity of the grid to its lowest level ever recorded. The bright and breezy weather helped wind and solar power make up about 28% of Great Britain’s electricity last month, narrowly behind gas-fired power generation, which made up 30% of the energy mix. Meanwhile, the record low demand for electricity during the coronavirus lockdown has left little room for Great Britain’s last remaining coal power plants to play a role. Since April Great Britain’s electricity system has run without coal-fired power for about 54 consecutive days, which has helped the carbon intensity of the electricity grid fall to the lowest average carbon intensity on record at 143 grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour. The lowest carbon intensity ever was recorded at 46g CO2/kWh on Sunday 24 May. The record was possible, in part, because of the collapse of energy demand in Great Britain caused by the coronavirus lockdown and two bank holidays in a fortnight. But the chief reason was the unseasonably sunny spring weather, said Roisin Quinn, head of National Grid’s control centre. This spring was the sunniest since records began in 1929, according to the Met Office, and the driest May for 124 years. The Met Office recorded more than 573 hours of sunshine between 1 March and 27 May, beating the previous record of 555.3 hours in 1948. “Great Britain’s incredible coal-free run has continued throughout May, giving us the first full calendar month – 744 straight hours – of electricity generation without coal since the Industrial Revolution,” Quinn said. This article was amended on 5 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to the UK when it should have said Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). The combination of record low demand for electricity and near-record highs for renewable energy output is a “unique challenge” for the National Grid’s control room, Quinn said, because engineers had to make sure that the rise of renewable energy did not overload the grid. National Grid’s energy system operator arm expects to spend £500m more than usual this summer because it will need to pay generators to turn off their wind farms, solar projects or power plants. Over the last bank holiday weekend alone the company reportedly paid £50m to electricity generators to turn down their supplies, on top of a £50m contract offered to the Sizewell B nuclear plant to run at half capacity this summer. • This article was amended on 5 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to the UK when it should have said Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/dec/23/uk-octopus-energy-japan-tokyo-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-23T18:06:43Z","webTitle":"UK's Octopus Energy valued at $2bn after Japan supply deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/23/uk-octopus-energy-japan-tokyo-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/dec/23/uk-octopus-energy-japan-tokyo-gas","fields":{"headline":"UK's Octopus Energy valued at $2bn after Japan supply deal","bodyText":"The one-time owner of a London coffee shop now has a paper fortune worth an estimated $155m (£115m) after a deal with a Japanese utility firm valued Octopus Energy, the sustainable energy business he founded little more than five years ago, at $2 billion. Greg Jackson, a serial entrepreneur, owns a 7.4% stake in Octopus, the UK’s fastest growing energy supplier. Octopus only attained ‘unicorn status’ – a term used to describe young start-up companies worth $1bn – earlier this year. A new investment agreed on Wednesday has doubled that value in the last eight months as it begins its global expansion. Octopus Energy will now supply electricity to homes in Japan under deal struck with Tokyo Gas, the largest gas utility company in Japan. Under the terms of the deal, Tokyo Gas will help establish the Octopus Energy brand in Japan as part of a new 30:70 joint venture, and will also buy a 9.7% stake in Octopus Energy for $200m, which values the company at $2.1bn. Jackson, who is also the chief executive of Octopus Energy, said the investment would “turbocharge our mission to revolutionise energy globally”. The rapid growth of Octopus means it is fast catching up with Centrica – the owner of the UK’s biggest energy supplier, British Gas. Centrica is valued at £2.5bn and also includes a string of power plants, North Sea oil and gas fields, and a stake in the UK’s nuclear reactors. British Gas has some 12 million customers, while Octopus supplies 1.8m homes in the UK and is growing quickly across global energy markets. In addition to boosting Jackson’s personal fortune, the deal will also provide a Christmas windfall for Octopus Energy’s staff. The company’s permanent employees – which number around 1,000 across its global offices – own 5% of the business , a stake which is now worth $100m, equal to an average $100,000 for every staff member. Jackson, who was also a founding investor in property management platform Rentify, founded Octopus Energy in 2015 with the backing of Octopus Investments, the UK’s biggest investor in solar power. On its website the company says it set out to disrupt the energy industry because it is “ruled by a handful of complacent dinosaurs peddling fossil fuels, pricing trickery and poor customer service”. It says it offers homes 100% renewable electricity which is “good for the planet, good for your wallet”. Octopus Energy only became a $1bn UK “tech unicorn” eight months ago after the sale of a 20% stake to Australian utility company Origin Energy for $200m. The Sydney-headquartered company invested a further $50m in Octopus alongside the Tokyo Gas deal to maintain its stake in the company. Jackson said: “When Origin invested less than eight months ago, we said it was fuel for stage 2 of our mission. Since then, Octopus Energy has accelerated that mission to make the global green revolution faster and cheaper by launching Octopus Energy Germany and New Zealand, acquiring Octopus Energy USA and acquiring Upside Energy to deepen our smart grid capabilities with their powerful technology.” Octopus Energy’s growth has been driven in large part by its software, Kraken. The technology platform makes it easier for energy suppliers to offer their customers “smart” renewable energy tariffs that integrate home batteries and electric vehicles to make using renewable power cheaper. Earlier this year Octopus was able to pay customers on its Agile tariff to use more electricity at home as renewable energy generation soared, by reflecting the “real-time” market price of green electricity. Octopus has licensed the Kraken tech platform to UK suppliers including E.ON UK and Good Energy. Globally, there are more than 17m homes connected to the Kraken platform, and Octopus hopes to reach 100m within the next few years. Gerry Grimstone, the minister for investment, said: “Japan is one of our largest trading partners and it’s fantastic to see how, following our historic trade deal, UK companies like Octopus Energy Group are securing Japanese investment in our world-leading renewable energy industry.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/jun/05/home-solar-panel-installations-fall-by-94-as-subsidies-cut","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-05T11:41:54Z","webTitle":"Home solar panel installations fall by 94% as subsidies cut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/05/home-solar-panel-installations-fall-by-94-as-subsidies-cut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/jun/05/home-solar-panel-installations-fall-by-94-as-subsidies-cut","fields":{"headline":"Home solar panel installations fall by 94% as subsidies cut","bodyText":"The Labour party has accused the government of “actively dismantling” the UK’s solar power industry after new installations by households collapsed by 94% last month. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, used prime minister’s questions to challenge the government’s record on climate action after scrapping subsidies for domestic solar panels from April. Standing in for Jeremy Corbyn, Long-Bailey said solar power had the potential to cut household bills and carbon emissions while creating thousands of jobs. “But the government, for some reason, appears to be determined to kill it off, while continuing to cheerlead for fracking,” she said. The solar feed-in tariffs had encouraged more than 800,000 homes to fit to their roofs solar photovoltaics, the panels which generate electricity. The end of the scheme was widely expected after a series of cuts to subsidy levels in recent years. Renewable energy developers and green groups had hoped ministers would replace the scheme with another incentive system to avoid dashing the sector’s momentum and accelerating job losses in the industry. Instead, officials confirmed that new solar pv installations would be expected to give their unused clean power to energy companies for free until a new scheme is set up. A spokesman for the government said new proposals will be unveiled in the coming days. “Parliament declared a climate emergency yet there is no evidence that this government takes this seriously,” Long-Bailey said. The opposition said data showed the scrapping of home panel subsidies from April caused new solar power capacity to fall from 79MW in March to only 5MW last month. At that rate it would take the government until 2092 to match Labour’s commitment to install solar panels on an additional 1.75m homes within its first term in power. The slowdown poses a big risk to plans put forward by the independent Committee on Climate Change to create a net zero carbon economy by 2045. Trade unions said last month that the number of jobs in renewable energy had plunged by nearly a third in recent years because of a slowdown in the rollout of new projects. In response to the opposition, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, told MPs that since 2010 the UK had cut greenhouse gas emissions faster than any other G7 nation. He said ministers would outline a plan to tackle the climate crisis and create green jobs “later this year”. Lidington said: “There are 400,000 jobs already in low-carbon businesses and their supply chains throughout the UK and scope for much larger low-carbon growth to support up to 2m jobs in the future. “We now have received advice from the independent climate change committee about how to time and to legislate for our transition to a completely decarbonised economy, and we will be bringing forward our decisions later this year as to how and when will be taking that action.” Theresa May had intended to confront Donald Trump about his views on climate breakdown during his state visit this week. “But with her government actively dismantling the UK solar industry it is unclear who has the most to teach the other about climate change denial,” Long-Bailey said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/nov/10/renewable-energy-covid-19-record-growth-2020","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-10T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy defies Covid-19 to hit record growth in 2020","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/renewable-energy-covid-19-record-growth-2020","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/nov/10/renewable-energy-covid-19-record-growth-2020","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy defies Covid-19 to hit record growth in 2020","bodyText":"Global renewable electricity installation will hit a record level in 2020, according to the International Energy Agency, in sharp contrast with the declines caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the fossil fuel sectors. The IEA report published on Tuesday says almost 90% of new electricity generation in 2020 will be renewable, with just 10% powered by gas and coal. The trend puts green electricity on track to become the largest power source in 2025, displacing coal, which has dominated for the past 50 years. Growing acceptance of the need to tackle the climate crisis by cutting carbon emissions has made renewable energy increasingly attractive to investors. The IEA reports that shares in renewable equipment makers and project developers have outperformed most major stock market indices and that the value of shares in solar companies has more than doubled since December 2019. The US is one of the world’s biggest markets for renewables and the IEA suggests deployment could accelerate even faster if the policies of the president-elect, Joe Biden, are implemented. “Renewable power is defying the difficulties caused by the pandemic, showing robust growth while others fuels struggle,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director. “The resilience and positive prospects of the sector are clearly reflected by continued strong appetite from investors.” Fossil fuels have had a turbulent time in 2020 as Covid-related measures caused demand from transport and other sectors to plunge. “In 2025, renewables are set to become the largest source of electricity generation worldwide, ending coal’s five decades as the top power provider,” Birol said. “By that time, renewables are expected to supply one-third of the world’s electricity.” Solar power capacity has increased by 18 times since 2010 and wind power by four times, according to IEA data. In October, Birol said: “I see solar becoming the new king of the world’s electricity markets.” Hydropower provided 77% of green power in 2010, but that has fallen to 45% in 2020. However, electricity is only about one-fifth of all energy use, with the burning of fuels in transport, industry and heating making up the bulk of energy emissions. The IEA forecasts that new renewable capacity around the world will increase by a record 200 gigawatts in 2020, driven by China and the US where developers are rushing to take advantage of expiring incentive schemes. There is even stronger growth to come in 2021, the IEA said, when India and the European Union will be the driving forces. But growth could decline slightly in 2022 under current policies, the IEA warned. “Renewables are resilient to the Covid crisis but not to policy uncertainties,” Birol said. “Governments can tackle these issues to help bring about a sustainable recovery and accelerate clean energy transitions. “In the US, for instance, if the proposed clean electricity policies of the next US administration are implemented, they could lead to a much more rapid deployment of solar PV and wind.” Analysis for the Guardian, published on Monday, showed that far more of the coronavirus recovery funds being spent by governments was going to fossil fuels sectors than green projects. “The natural environment and climate change have not been a core part of the thinking in the bulk of recovery plans,” said Jason Eis, the chief executive of Vivid Economics. “In the majority of countries we are not seeing a green recovery coming through at all.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/apr/28/britain-breaks-record-for-coal-free-power-generation","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-28T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"Britain breaks record for coal-free power generation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/britain-breaks-record-for-coal-free-power-generation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/apr/28/britain-breaks-record-for-coal-free-power-generation","fields":{"headline":"Britain breaks record for coal-free power generation","bodyText":"Britain has gone without coal-fired power generation for its longest stretch since the Industrial Revolution, breaking the existing record of 18 consecutive days this morning. The UK’s energy system has not used coal-fired plants for more than 438 hours, according to National Grid data, the longest uninterrupted period since 1882. The 18-day stretch has broken the UK’s previous record, which was set on 4 June 2019, partly because of a collapse in demand for electricity during the coronavirus lockdown and because of greater use of solar power. The UK set a new solar power record on 20 April after solar farms generated more than 9.6GW of electricity for the first time. The lockdown has also caused the UK’s electricity demand to fall to record lows because schools, shops, factories and restaurants have closed. On Monday the demand was forecast to fall almost a fifth below the usual levels in April, according to the data. The lower overall demand for electricity means low-carbon energy sources are able to make up a greater proportion of the energy system than usual. This month National Grid said it may need to turn windfarms and some power plants off in order to avoid overloading the electricity grid. The new coal-free record comes almost three years after the grid first ran without coal power for 24 hours for the first time. Since then, all but four of the UK’s coal power plants have shut in advance of a government ban on coal generation from 2025. Coal made up only 2.1% of the country’s total power mix last year, a dramatic fall from almost a quarter just four years ago. The collapse of coal and rise of renewable energy sources have led to a drastic reduction in carbon emissions from the UK power sector. Since 2012, the average carbon intensity of the grid – the amount of emissions required to produce one kilowatt hour of energy – has declined by more than two-thirds, from 507g of CO2 to 161g. Britain’s dwindling fleet of coal plants still includes the West Burton A and Ratcliffe-on-Soar power stations in Nottinghamshire, the Kilroot facilityin Northern Ireland and two generation units at the Drax site in Yorkshire, which are earmarked for conversion to burn gas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/dec/28/storm-bella-helps-uk-record-wind-power-generation-boxing-day","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-28T17:47:00Z","webTitle":"Storm Bella helps Great Britain set new record for wind power generation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/28/storm-bella-helps-uk-record-wind-power-generation-boxing-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/dec/28/storm-bella-helps-uk-record-wind-power-generation-boxing-day","fields":{"headline":"Storm Bella helps Great Britain set new record for wind power generation","bodyText":"More than half of Great Britain’s daily electricity came from wind turbines for the first time on Boxing Day, as the country headed for its “greenest year on record”, due in part to the coronavirus. As Storm Bella arrived, bringing gusts of up to 100mph, wind provided 50.7% of Great Britain’s electricity according to data charting the power generation mix. While wind briefly hit 60% in August, it had not previously sustained such levels for 24 hours. “Britain has experienced a renewables revolution over the last decade with the growth of biomass, wind and solar power,” said Drax Electric Insights, part of coal and biomass power company Drax, which tracks the data. The milestone follows a string of new low-carbon records set in 2020, as Covid-19 restrictions depressed power demand, helping wind and solar to claim a larger share of the mix. Fossil fuels have increasingly been edged out as a result, helping Great Britain enjoy its longest coal-free period since the Industrial Revolution. Gas and coal power plants made up 36% of the electricity generated in England, Scotland and Wales in the year up to 21 December 2020, according to data from National Grid’s electricity system operator (NGESO), down from 46% in 2019. Wind and solar farms delivered 29% of the electricity mix, rising from 23% of electricity generated in Great Britain last year, according to the early data report. While Boxing Day set a record for the highest share of power generated by windfarms, it was not a record for the most power they have ever supplied. That was set earlier this month, when windfarms delivered 17.3 gigawatts. Because overall demand was higher at the time, their percentage share of total power generation was lower than it was on Boxing Day, at 40%. The larger role for renewables has caused the “carbon intensity” of Great Britain’s electricity to fall to its lowest level on record of 181g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of electricity, compared with an average of 215g last year and 248g in 2018. Rob Rome, NGESO’s head of national control, said: “2020 has been a record-breaking year for Great Britain’s electricity system. The grid continues to transform at an astonishing rate as we harness the growth of renewable power sources. “We saw the highest ever level of solar generation in April, the longest period of coal-free operation between April and June, and the greenest ever month in May,” and the wind record set earlier this month illustrated the “changing nature of electricity in Britain”. There was a blip during August and September, when the electricity system bucked the trend of declining carbon intensity as emissions rose despite lower demand for electricity, suggesting a higher use of fossil fuels. Tom Edwards, an analyst at the energy consulting group Cornwall Insight, said the electricity system operator increased its reliance on gas-fired power plants by 20% in September compared with the year before, amid a slump in renewable energy generation. “To compensate for the lower wind speeds and dunkelflautes – dark, still periods – we turned to gas and coal,” he said. “It’s part and parcel of relying more on weather driven capacity and interconnector exports, which makes us more reliant on the vagaries of the wind and sun.” Steve Jennings, a partner at the consulting firm PwC, said the “key challenge on our pathway to net zero” is what the electricity system does “when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine”. The falling cost of energy storage – such as batteries – is expected to play a major role in Great Britain’s ability to use more renewable energy, and less fossil fuel power, alongside a more flexible approach to when major energy users consume electricity. But Jennings said nuclear power and gas-fired power plants fitted with carbon capture technology would still be required if Great Britain hopes to avoid unabated fossil-fuel generation. “Everyone is very positive about the UK’s green energy records but I think the microscope will begin to turn to what is happening on a daily basis rather than simply a cumulative basis,” he said. The coronavirus pandemic reduced electricity usage overall in 2020 compared with a normal year, as large swathes of the economy have been forced to shut their doors for extended periods. Average power demand across the course of the year has dropped from 32.58GW in 2019 to 30.6GW so far in 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2021/apr/25/a-hassle-free-alpine-crossing-barely-1km-in-i-see-wild-brumbies-in-the-distance","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-24T20:00:48Z","webTitle":"A hassle-free alpine crossing: ‘Barely 1km in, I see wild brumbies in the distance’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/apr/25/a-hassle-free-alpine-crossing-barely-1km-in-i-see-wild-brumbies-in-the-distance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2021/apr/25/a-hassle-free-alpine-crossing-barely-1km-in-i-see-wild-brumbies-in-the-distance","fields":{"headline":"A hassle-free alpine crossing: ‘Barely 1km in, I see wild brumbies in the distance’","bodyText":"Jean-Francois Rupp has been living in the Alpine region of Victoria for only five years but already he has seen the climate and environment change significantly. Rupp, who grew up in the snowy the French Alps, noticed Australia’s snow seasons becoming shorter each year. As the founder of a tourism company, Alpine Nature Experience, watching the region’s biggest drawcard dwindle was very worrying. “Already I can see specific types of birds coming back earlier and earlier each season because the snow doesn’t last as long,” Rupp says. “I can already see dramatic changes in that short period of time. It’s pretty scary.” It’s an issue tourism operators who rely on the snow season alone for an income can no longer afford to ignore. A 2017 report from the CSIRO on climate change impacts on snow in Victoria warned that across four ski resorts (Falls Creek, Mt Hotham, Mt Buller and Mt Buffalo) the average snow season may be up to 80 days shorter under the worst-case scenario. Rupp established Alpine Nature Experience as a fully sustainable business, which has helped him to adapt to the challenges presented by short snow seasons. He started with environmentally friendly experiences, such as evening snowshoe hikes through Mt Hotham, leading to a hidden eco-village with a heated tipi, hand-built from reclaimed timber. In winter he also offers overnight stays in heated eco-domes and igloos, built on platforms so that vegetation beneath is undisturbed. The experiences were perfect for those keen to see snow but not interested in skiing. His off-grid eco-village operates on solar power and all equipment is walked in and out so vehicles don’t disturb the environment. Rupp realised, however, that he would need to offer nature experiences year round, given the shortening snow seasons and unreliable snowfalls. He also knew the high country’s mountains, valleys, bush, wildlife and creeks had more to offer than just snow. The result is a multi-day hike from Falls Creek to Hotham in the warmer months, an approximately 40km trek over two days. The concept is simple: provide travellers with a sustainable, multi-day hiking experience without the logistical stress. Sometimes Rupp will accompany walkers, but the hike can also be self-guided. All that’s required is a small day pack with enough space to carry the essentials, like water, lunch and wet weather gear. Everything else, from accomodation to transport, is arranged. I opted to do the self-guided option, and after parking my car in Bright I’m met by Rupp the evening before the hike. He drove me and four other hikers through winding mountain roads to the Diana Alpine Lodge at Falls Creek, about an hour away. Here lodge manager and chef Lisa Logan provided a three-course Japanese-inspired dinner to fuel us before the morning’s efforts. Logan also prepares all the food travellers take in their day-packs – freshly made salads, muffins, and frittata – to eat on each day’s walk. After breakfast I am armed with maps, snacks and an extensive briefing from Rupp, who drops me about 10km away at the Wallace Hut heritage trail car park where the trek begins. Just 500m down the track is the oldest cattlemen’s hut in the region, the heritage-listed Wallace Hut. The hike takes me along the aqueduct trail and past Rover chalet to Cope Hut, a ski refuge built in 1929 and an idyllic picnic spot for my lunch. The next stretch is an easy walk through grassy alpine meadows on the Australian Alps walking track. That track is one of the country’s best known and for good reason – there are stunning views across seas of wildflowers. Heavy rains overnight made hiking across the high plains’ alpine wetlands an adventure in dodging deep puddles and traversing slippery mud, proving good waterproof hiking boots are a must, no matter the time of year. Eventually I reach Pole 333, the junction of four walking tracks, and begin the steep descent into the West Kiewa valley towards Weston Hut, which stands amid snow gums and lush green meadows and with Mt Feathertop in view along the way. The other hikers and I assemble at the hut, where Rupp is waiting with drinks and a campfire over which vegetables and beef are grilling. There is even a shower for those who want it, but for most of the hikers the warmth of the campfire (and the gin and tonics) are enough to shake off any aches. Like Rupp’s igloos, our tents are suspended above the ground to avoid disturbing the earth beneath. Though the original plan had been to stay at the Blair Hut campsite, we changed course slightly due to the wild weather the night before. Rain made accessing that site, and lugging all the gear in, too risky for Rupp. He is constantly monitoring the weather and any warnings, and speaks regularly to local rangers to make sure the routes are safe so he can update the itinerary if necessary. After a night sleeping in a tent strung up between trees, I embark on day two of the hike. Barely 1km in I see wild brumbies in the distance. Day two is more challenging, and includes the option to hike along Razorback Ridge, one of the most popular hikes in Victoria, though Rupp recommends against this owing to the weather. I fill my drink bottle and wash my face in the stream near Dibbins Hut before embarking on a steep climb up Swindlers Spur. The climb and subsequent views of Mt Feathertop, across the Bogong high plains and Basalt Temple is my favourite part of the trek. Heading towards Derrick Hut, a charming weatherboard structure, I’m surrounded by masses of white, tangled snow gums. The beauty of visiting the region off season is that there are few people around, providing plenty of time and space to stop and take in the scenery. By this point, the finish line at Mt Loch car park is in reach, where Rupp meets me and the other hikers with watermelon and an esky full of drinks. He drives us to our accommodation for the night, The General resort, where we get a pub feed and enjoy a spa before Rupp drives us back to Bright the next morning. Throughout the experience, Rupp talks about all of the ways the hike is low impact, and the importance of protecting the local environment. Nothing is ever left behind. Even the lunch bags we are given are reusable, and waste is disposed of in compostable bags and processed by the local Mount Hotham composting facilities. The experience costs $1,490 a person, which covers all meals, gear, and accommodation, and 1% of annual sales is donated to an environmental organisation. “A big part of what we aim to do is have have people come away from the experience richer than when they arrived,” Rupp says. “Yes, the state of the climate is such a mess and what we are doing won’t make the ski season longer. But … if we can help educate people, the impact of what we are doing extends beyond just our business. “Sustainability is a mindset.” The guest travelled courtesy of Tourism Victoria and Alpine Nature Experience.

A new study by consultants Delta-EE for Ease found that the European market grew by a total of 1 gigawatt-hours in 2019, a significant slowdown compared with 2018, when the energy storage market exceeded expectations to grow by 1.47GWh. The slowdown in 2019 has emerged amid rising concern that the outbreak of the coronavirus may stall the rollout of clean energy technologies in 2020, dealing a double blow to the clean energy industry. The 2019 downturn was particularly marked for large-scale energy storage projects which connect directly to energy grids, and can help make better use of renewable energy by storing the clean electricity to use when wind and solar power is not available. These large, utility-scale projects often require planning permission, government financial support or procurement tenders to move ahead. Meanwhile, the rollout of home battery kits, which relies far less on policy support, remained a fast-growing market. Patrick Clerens, the Ease secretary general , said: “The message is clear: even if energy storage is a key enabler of the energy transition and clearly seen as a major tool to achieve the emissions targets linked to the Paris agreement, more support is needed.” The report expects the EU’s clean energy package, which has legislated support for clean energy technologies, to be key to creating a framework for investing in energy storage. Clerens said the package was “an important step” which should allow energy storage “to reach its full potential fast”. Robin Adey-Johnson, the author of the Delta-EE report, added: “Storage remains a young market and the regulatory landscape is trying to catch up. So, year-on-year fluctuations in market growth are not unexpected. But we see strong underlying drivers and we expect further market expansion in the early 2020s as regulation stabilises and revenue streams mature.” However, the global outbreak of the Covid-19 virus is likely to delay policies supporting clean energy technologies as well as hit the supply chain which could see the rate of battery installations fall by 4% globally, according to a recent report by BloombergNEF (BNEF). The BNEF analysts said that even though many Chinese factories are starting to return to work there will still be short-term bottlenecks in the supply chain for energy infrastructure, especially for batteries, underlining the need for diversified supply chains and local manufacturing hubs across Asia, Europe and the US. But the analysts added that they are “more concerned about demand, as policymakers may divert attention away from clean energy to more pressing concerns”. BNEF also expects the year ahead to mark the first time the world’s solar power growth falls since the 1980s. The analysts slashed forecasts for new solar power projects by 8%. It expected sales of electric vehicles to stall too due to the coronavirus. • This article was amended on 24 March 2020 because Bloomberg New Energy Finance is now called BloombergNEF."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jun/15/we-need-real-change-japanese-activist-urges-faster-coal-phase-out","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-15T07:30:37Z","webTitle":"‘Our fight is more visible’: Goldman environment prize winners see shift in political winds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/15/we-need-real-change-japanese-activist-urges-faster-coal-phase-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jun/15/we-need-real-change-japanese-activist-urges-faster-coal-phase-out","fields":{"headline":"‘Our fight is more visible’: Goldman environment prize winners see shift in political winds","bodyText":"For more than 20 years, Kimiko Hirata has fought a long and often lonely battle against coal in Japan, but for the first time the climate activist believes the dirtiest fossil fuel is on the run, not just in her country but across the world. Like several other winners of this year’s Goldman environmental prize, the frontline campaigner sees a shift in the political winds that has created a rare – and perhaps final – opportunity to reduce emissions and rebuild the planet’s natural life support systems. This optimism is based on local victories that prove positive change is possible, along with global shifts driven by activists such as Greta Thunberg, Joe Biden’s victory in the US presidential election and a flurry of major UN environmental conferences. For a country like Japan, which is strongly influenced by external trends, this has created a sense of urgency that has been missing in the past. “This is a moment when international momentum is strong. Japan feels it has to be on board,” Hirata told the Guardian ahead of Tuesday’s Goldman award ceremony. As founder of the Kiko Network, which has been campaigning for emissions reductions since before the Kyoto climate conference of 1997, she sees strong evidence that Japan is at a turning point. One third of planned coal plants have been cancelled. Several major institutions has stopped financing overseas coal projects. The government has also set a net zero target for 2050 and put in place a 2030 reduction target. “The time to worry about new coal is over,” she said. “I am pretty sure there will be no new projects in Japan and none financed overseas. Finance institutions and trading houses now appreciate the business and reputational risks of coal. They don’t want a downgrade from Moody’s.” These victories have been a long time coming. Civil society is relatively weak in Japan compared with many European nations. In the past, few NGOs took up the issue and, partly as a result, the public saw global heating as a low priority. Hirata has helped to nudge the issue higher up the political agenda by inviting overseas speakers, organising talks in towns with power plants, and emphasising the dangers of coal. Today, there is a strong anti-coal movement that also includes domestic chapters of international groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. With the direction now set, Hirata is now trying to push her foot on the accelerator. East Asia’s economic powerhouses have been the leading funder of coal power for many years, but they are increasingly wary about climate risks. South Korea has promised to scale back coal funding. China – which is still by far the biggest user of the fuel and the largest investor in overseas projects – is still a laggard, but Hirata said she was encouraged by Xi Jinping’s recent pledge to reduce coal power. “Momentum towards coal phase-out is growing worldwide,” she said. “The trend and direction are right. The problem is the speed. Implementation has to follow more quickly after policy shifts. We see lots of vision and policy, but we need a real economic change.” In Japan, power companies continue to drag their feet and extend the lifespan of existing or under-construction coal plants with dubious promises to upgrade technology. Hirata said the government needed to be firmer in standing up to vested interests to ensure the phase-out was not knocked off track. “That is clearly not the way to a sharp cut by 2030,” she said. “There is no space for greenwashing any more. They must really reduce.” Utilities such as Tepco, J Power and Chubu Electric are politically influential. In the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, many turned off reactors and switched on coal plants so they could retain control of the grid. “It’s basically the same business groups and the same large scale so they could maintain their profits. If the government had moved towards wind and solar power, then different companies would be involved, and profits and the scale of each project would be smaller.” Even today, she said, some firms are resisting decarbonisation. This year’s international meetings, including last weekend’s G7 summit and Cop26 in Glasgow in November will be vital to inject more urgency. “This is an important moment. There won’t be a similar opportunity to raise ambition for some time. Countries have to seriously face the status of the climate and step up significantly,” she said. “I have to be optimistic and count on the leadership of UK government to get a good outcome. It is crucial because there is no time left to solve this problem. If we fail, we may lose the climate fight.” For this reason, she is concerned that the UK government is merely reviewing rather than cancelling plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria. As host of Cop26, she feels the UK should set a more positive example. “[The Cumbria plan] isn’t good. From 2017, when the UK launched the Powering Past Coal Alliance, we have seen the UK as a leader in the coal phase-out fight. We need them to be consistent, especially now they are COP president. Any inconsistency in discussions is very, very concerning.” The importance of a link between global and local action was also stressed by other new Goldman prize winners. Thai Van Nguyen, a wildlife campaigner in Vietnam, was given the award for his work protecting the pangolin, the world’s most poached and trafficked animal. Since 2018, he has rescued more than 1,000 of the scaly anteaters and established Vietnam’s first anti-poaching unit, which has destroyed thousands of animal traps and arrested 244 illegal hunters. His organisation, Save Vietnam Wildlife, has also launched public education campaigns to highlight the plight of the animals, all six species of which are on the endangered list as a result of strong demand in Chinese traditional medicine. After an 80% fall in poaching at Pumat National Park, Van Nguyen said, the government was now looking into expanding the model across the country. “The pangolin situation in Vietnam is getting better. We are seeing more photos of pangolin in forests from camera traps. We recorded 1,600 pangolins in past seven years. This is a positive,” he said. The challenge now, he said, was stronger enforcement in neighbouring China, which is the biggest market of pangolin scales, meat and blood. The Covid crisis has provided temporary respite. Illegal trade has fallen because border checks have been tightened and the government in Beijing announced tougher controls on pangolin sales after rumours that the animal was a possible vector for the disease. Van Nguyen said this year’s UN biodiversity conference in Kunming, China, will be an opportunity to build on these temporary steps. The host nation has banned sales of pangolin meat, but the animal is still approved as an ingredient in traditional medicine. “We’d like them to take more action on that. We hope the problems will be raised in Kunming and more countries will put pressure on China,” he said. Overall, he felt encouraged that the pandemic had helped to raise public support for nature protection. “I think people are more concerned about the relationship between human health and environmental health. I hope people wake up and take action, so we don’t have another pandemic.” Guarded optimism was also the message of this year’s winner in Central and South America, Liz Chicaje Churay, with increasing recognition of the role of indigenous people in maintaining forests and other globally-important ecosystems. Chicaje is a leader of the indigenous Bora community of Loreto, Peru, who has suffered death threats for campaigning for her people’s territory of Yaguas to be recognised as a protected national park. The remote region contains Amazon rainforest that sprawls over 2m acres and is home to more than 3,000 species of plants, 500 species of birds, and 550 species of fish, as well as manatees, river dolphins and giant otters. In approving the national park status in 2018, the Peruvian government noted the change in status would enable the area to sequester 1.5m tonnes of carbon over the following 20 years. For Chicaje, this progress at a local level needs to be matched by greater recognition at a global level. The mood, she said, is ripe. “More people are listening now to what indigenous people are doing for forests. But governments need to create more indigenous areas.” As a delegate to a previous climate conference, she is hopeful that this year’s conferences for biodiversity and climate can make a difference. “I’m feeling optimistic. I think things are going to change. There is more and more news about climate change. Our fight is more visible to the world.

This advance saw 70% of the laser energy put in released as nuclear energy. A pulse of light, focused to tiny spots within a 10-metre diameter vacuum chamber, triggered the collapse of a capsule of fuel from roughly the size of the pupil in your eye to the diameter of a human hair. This implosion created the extreme conditions of temperature and pressure needed for atoms of hydrogen to combine into new atoms and release, kilogram for kilogram, 10m times the energy that would result from burning coal. The result is tantalisingly close to a demonstration of “net energy gain”, the long sought-after goal of fusion scientists in which an amount greater than 100% of the energy put into a fusion experiment comes out as nuclear energy. The aim of these experiments is – for now – to show proof of principle only: that energy can be generated. The team behind the success are very close to achieving this: they have managed a more than 1,000-fold improvement in energy release between 2011 and today. Prof Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College London, said last month that “The pace of improvement in energy output has been rapid, suggesting we may soon reach more energy milestones, such as exceeding the energy input from the lasers used to kickstart the process.” If you’re not familiar with nuclear fusion, it’s different from its cousin, nuclear fission, which powers today’s nuclear plants by taking big, unstable atoms and splitting them. Fusion takes small atoms and combines them to forge larger atoms. It is the universe’s ubiquitous power source: it’s what causes the sun and stars to shine, and it’s the reaction that created most of the atoms we are made of. Scientists have long been excited about fusion because it doesn’t produce carbon dioxide or long-lived radioactive waste, since the fuel it requires – two types of hydrogen known as deuterium and tritium – is plentiful enough to last for at least thousands of years, and because there is zero chance of meltdown. Unlike renewables such as wind and solar power, plants based on fusion would also take up little space compared with the power they would be able to generate. However, because the NIF’s breakthrough is about demonstrating the principle only, the total amount of energy generated is not very impressive; it’s only just enough to boil a kettle. Nor does the gain measurement account for the energy used to run the facility, just what’s in the laser pulse. Despite this, it is nevertheless a landmark moment in the decades-long quest to produce fusion energy and use it to power the planet – which is, perhaps, the greatest scientific and technological challenge humanity has ever undertaken. Although the experiment may have happened in a vacuum, NIF’s advance has not, and the pace of progress in fusion may surprise some long-time sceptics. Even Dr Mark Herrmann, head of the NIF’s fusion programme, says the latest development was “a surprise to everyone”. Many recent advances have been made with a different type of fusion device, the tokamak: a doughnut-shaped machine that uses a tube of magnetic fields to confine its fuel for as long as possible. China’s Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (East) set another world record in May by keeping fuel stable for 100 seconds at a temperature of 120m degrees celsius – eight times hotter than the sun’s core. The world’s largest ever magnetic fusion machine, Iter, is under construction in the south of France and many experts think it will have the scale needed to reach net energy gain. The UK-based Joint European Torus (Jet), which holds the current magnetic fusion record for power of 67%, is about to attempt to produce the largest total amount of energy of any fusion machine in history. Alternative designs are also being explored: the UK government has announced plans for an advanced tokamak with an innovative spherical geometry, and “stellarators”, a type of fusion device that had been consigned to the history books, are enjoying a revival having been enabled by new technologies such as superconducting magnets. This is a lot of progress, but it’s not even the biggest change: that would be the emergence of private sector fusion firms. The recently formed Fusion Industry Association estimates that more than $2bn of investment has flooded into fusion startups. The construction of experimental reactors by these firms is proceeding at a phenomenal rate: Commonwealth Fusion Systems, which has its origins in MIT research, has begun building a demonstration reactor in Massachusetts; TAE Technologies has just raised $280m to build its next device; and Canadian-based General Fusion has opted to house its new $400m plant in the UK. This will be constructed in Oxfordshire, an emerging hotspot for the industry that is home to private ventures First Light Fusion and Tokamak Energy as well as the publicly funded Jet and Mast (Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak) Upgrade devices run by the UK Atomic Energy Authority. Some of the investors in these firms have deep pockets: Jeff Bezos, Peter Thiel, Lockheed Martin, Goldman Sachs, Legal &amp; General, and Chevron have all financed enterprises pursuing this new nuclear power source. For now, publicly funded labs are producing results a long way ahead of the private firms – but this could change. With such progress, interest, and investment – and net energy gain perhaps just one or two more improvements away – perhaps it’s time to retire the old joke, so cliched it has been banned by editors at the Economist, that “fusion is 30 years away… and always will be”. But it does depend on what we mean by “fusion” in that context; the scientists and their backers are now focusing on the bigger objective of fusion as a viable power source like fission, solar or wind. This requires far more than just “breakeven” in energy: a functioning fusion power plant would probably need at least 30 times the energy out for energy put in. However, scaling up the gain in energy is but one difficulty in making fusion a viable power source. A commercial reactor will have to solve several tricky engineering problems such as extracting the heat energy and finding materials that will withstand the relentless bombardment the reactor chamber will receive over its lifetime. Fusion reactors must also be self-sufficient in tritium, one of the two types of hydrogen that are fed in as fuel. For this, it is necessary to surround the reactor chamber with lithium because its atoms are converted to tritium when struck by the most energetic products of fusion – and this process has yet to be demonstrated at scale. Those pursuing fusion have long known of the obstacles, but – with limited resources – achieving the immediate goal of gain has been a bigger priority. That’s beginning to change as fusion scientists and engineers look beyond scientific proof of principle. Around the world, several recently opened facilities are dedicated to solving these problems and, although they’re not trivial, everyone in fusion is confident that the obstacles can be overcome: progress depends on investment and will. To find examples of how these two factors can be transformative, look no further than the pandemic. A sudden shot of both investment and motivation transformed the use of mRNA to fight disease from a wild idea to an accepted technology in the form of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Katalin Karikó, whose foundational work on mRNA has been key to the success of the technology, had the will to persevere for many years with little recognition and even less funding. Her dedication, and that of her colleagues, combined with a massive investment in development, testing and deployment is what enabled the vaccines to be ready in record time. The world wanted this, and we made it happen. Global heating has made the need to turn carbon-free fusion energy into a usable power source ever more urgent. The world’s response thus far has been lackadaisical: it’s 2021 and more than 80% of global primary energy consumption still comes from coal, oil and gas. Fossil fuel consumption actually increased between 2009 and 2019 (though it fell in 2020 as most of the world locked down to help prevent the spread of Covid-19). While progress to date has been slow, most nations have pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Dr Ajay Gambhir, a senior policy research fellow at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change, Imperial College London, says most electricity generation needs to come from near-zero carbon sources as soon as 2030 in order to achieve this. Dr Michael Bluck, also of the Grantham Institute, expresses serious doubts that commercial fusion energy will be ready in time, saying that it is “very difficult to see this [conventional tokamaks] happening until after 2050” and that laser fusion has “another 50 years to go, if at all”. Those working in fusion do recognise that time is of the essence, and it’s part of what is motivating the recent acceleration. The startups’ vision necessarily sees fusion power being deployed at an unprecedented rate. “If we want to contribute to net zero by 2050 we need to be building plants, multiple, in the 2040s,” Nick Hawker, CEO of First Light Fusion, tells me. And who says the fusion firms couldn’t do it with the right tailwind? We would never have believed that a vaccine, let alone the first mRNA vaccine, could be developed and approved within a year instead of over decades. The scale of the climate challenge is so immense that we need to throw the kitchen sink at it. That means renewables, fission, energy storage, carbon capture, and any other lifeline humanity can grab. If the world doesn’t have the will to at least try to deploy fusion energy too, it would be a missed opportunity. Fusion could afford people in developing countries the same energy consumption opportunities as people in developed nations enjoy today – rather than the global cutbacks that may be necessary otherwise. And we are likely to need fusion well beyond 2050, too: as a source of large-scale power to extract the carbon dioxide we’ve already put into the atmosphere, and because it’s the only feasible way we can explore space beyond Earth’s immediate vicinity. Whether commercial fusion energy is ready in time to help with global warming or not depends on us as a society and how badly we want – no, need – star power on our side. • Arthur Turrell is the author of The Star Builders: Nuclear Fusion and the Race to Power the Planet, published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (£20).

This was back in March, as schools across the country started closing because of Covid-19. Cheromiah, a PhD student at the University of Arizona, had begun hearing stories of Native students parking outside gas stations to finish their homework or reading for class. It was there they could maybe get better cell reception, or wifi, or enough light when the power was out at home. Unequal access to utilities – especially electricity – made remote learning nearly impossible on Native lands. Cheromiah, who leads a mentorship program for Native students, said that for many students it was “just not an option”. She mailed about a dozen iPads to students before realizing their need for more resources was too great. The pandemic has exacerbated already severe energy and economic inequalities in Indian country. For decades, many tribes have suffered from inefficient energy infrastructure, high costs and a lack of funding for new projects. Low electricity rates are compounded by limited cell and broadband service on many reservations. These needs have only gotten worse during the pandemic. In the face of these challenges, Native people are turning to renewable energy to help their tribes achieve energy and economic independence. If successful, it could also provide growing job opportunities for communities that sorely need them. Energy infrastructure is essential to living with and containing the virus. Shawnell Damon, who leads contact-tracing efforts for the Navajo area Indian Health Service (IHS), said tracing on the Navajo nation requires “extra work that other contact tracers throughout the US don’t have to do”. For example, after attempting three phone calls, Navajo contact tracers send a community health worker to find that person, an extra step made more frequent by dropped calls and spotty cell service. Contact tracers at rural testing sites, like the ones found throughout the Navajo nation, are often forced to use paper records until they have a strong enough internet connection to upload the data to the Navajo area IHS database. Inadequate electric and heating systems are not only insufficient – they’re also more expensive, and the energy bills can quickly stack up in the pandemic. Henry Red Cloud, the Oglala Lakota founder of a solar training center on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota, said Native people are desperate for solutions. “They’re quarantined in their homes and using a lot of power and not having the dollars to pay that kilowatt usage.” Over the past 20 years, Red Cloud’s various companies and initiatives have built thousands of renewable energy set-ups, like solar-powered furnaces and electrical systems that are also more affordable. But high energy costs aren’t the only problem for Native communities; on the Pine Ridge reservation, Red Cloud estimates there are thousands of people without any running water and electricity – making following hygiene guidelines and stay-at-home orders more complicated, if not completely unrealistic. Red Cloud stresses that these inequalities did not happen by accident. The federal government’s violations of treaties it made with tribes left many without essential resources. Decades of federal government decisions and policies have continued to ignore the rights and needs of tribes, according to Wahleah Johns, the head of the non-profit Native Renewables, which aims to bring off-grid solar power to the Navajo nation and other Indigenous communities. “In the early 1900s, when they were expanding the transmission grid, a lot of the plans didn’t include tribal nations and sovereign nations,” Johns said. The Rural Electrification Act of 1936, which offered federal loans to deploy electrical systems in rural areas across the country, but left out many tribal nations, is an example. These policies have directly led to inequalities that the pandemic is now exacerbating. Both Johns and Red Cloud run job trainings in solar power, which they hope can help Native communities find their own solutions to this crisis, which continues to disrupt every aspect of life. Typically, Cheromiah would have spent this spring traveling to tribal schools. But since the onset of the pandemic, the lack of energy and internet access means remote sessions were often impossible in many tribal communities. “Our students don’t even have the basics,” Cheromiah said. Johns is particularly passionate about bringing electricity to these rural Native communities, knowing that it will ease financial burdens and help communities stay connected. “How many trips you take the store to load up on food, especially fresh fruits – those are things most Americans take for granted during this pandemic [because they have the] luxury of access to power and refrigeration,” Johns explains. The pandemic has delayed several projects that aim to alleviate energy inequality in Indian country. Red Cloud and Johns have halted all solar jobs trainings. Light Up Navajo II, the second phase of a project that brought power to 225 Navajo homes in a 2019 pilot, has been put on hold. Despite the challenges, Johns remains optimistic. Her non-profit, Native Renewables, which had only built a half-dozen solar units before the pandemic, hopes to begin construction in September for the first one hundred units. Red Cloud is eager to resume trainings, which he plans to do in the fall. “There is going to be a huge shift towards clean energy, so what we’re doing is developing green teams so that when all of those jobs happen, Native people are going to be on the forefront,” said Red Cloud. Beyond the economic potential of solar energy, Johns and Red Cloud believe that it offers a path towards building stronger communities that will be more resilient to future challenges. Red Cloud’s dream is ambitious – to guide a tribe to energy independence before the rest of mainstream America. Despite the obstacles, Johns shares the same vision. “We can be an example of what self-sufficiency looks like and what self determination looks like on Indigenous lands.” This article was amended on 12 August 2020 to fix an incorrect pronoun"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/may/01/climate-change-environment-hope-future-optimism-success","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-01T12:12:06Z","webTitle":"Dare we hope?

Here’s my cautious case for climate optimism","bodyText":"That we are living in science fiction was brought home to me last week when I put down Kim Stanley Robinson’s superb climate-futures novel The Ministry for the Future and picked up Bill McKibben’s New Yorker letter on climate, warning of the melting of the Thwaites Glacier, “already known as the ‘doomsday glacier’ because its collapse could raise global sea levels by as much as three feet”. Where we are now would have seemed like science fiction itself 20 years ago; where we need to be will take us deeper into that territory. Three things matter for climate chaos and our response to it – the science reporting on current and potential conditions, the technology offering solutions, and the organizing which is shifting perspectives and policy. Each is advancing rapidly. The science mostly gives us terrifying news of more melting, more storms, more droughts, more fires, more famines. But the technological solutions and the success of the organizing to address this largest of all crises have likewise grown by leaps and bounds. For example, ideas put forth in the Green New Deal in 2019, seen as radical at the time, are now the kind of stuff President Biden routinely proposes in his infrastructure and jobs plans. It’s not easy to see all the changes – you have to be a wonk to follow the details on new battery storage solutions or the growth of solar power in cheapness, proliferation, efficiency and possibility, or new understanding about agriculture and soil management to enhance carbon sequestration. You have to be a policy nerd to keep track of the countless new initiatives around the world. They include, recently, the UK committing to end overseas fossil fuel finance in December, the EU in January deciding to “discourage all further investments into fossil-fuel-based energy infrastructure projects in third countries”, and the US making a less comprehensive but meaningful effort this spring to curtail funding for overseas extraction. In April, oil-rich California made a commitment to end fossil fuel extraction altogether – if by a too-generous deadline. A lot of these policies have been deemed both good and not good enough. They do not get us to where we need to be, but they lay the foundation for further shifts, and like the Green New Deal many of them seemed unlikely a few years ago. The US itself has, of course, made a huge U-turn with a presidency that has begun by undoing much of what the previous administration did, reregulating what was deregulated, restarting support for research, and rejoining the Paris climate accords. The Biden administration is regularly doing things that would have been all but inconceivable in previous administrations, and while it deserves credit, more credit should go to the organizers who have redefined what is necessary, reasonable and possible. Both technologically and politically far more is possible. There are so many moving parts. The dire straits of the fossil fuel industry is one of them – as the climate journalist Antonia Juhasz put it recently: “The end of oil is near.” The organization Carbon Tracker, whose reports are usually somber reading, just put out a report so stunning the word encouraging is hardly adequate. In sum, current technology could produce a hundred times as much electricity from solar and wind as current global demand; prices on solar continue to drop rapidly and dramatically; and the land required to produce all this energy would take less than is currently given over to fossil fuels. It is a vision of a completely different planet, because if you change how we produce energy you change our geopolitics – for the better – and clean our air and renew our future. The report concludes: “The technical and economic barriers have been crossed and the only impediment to change is political.” Those barriers seemed insurmountable at the end of the last millennium. One of the things that’s long been curious about this crisis is that the amateurs and newcomers tend to be more alarmist and defeatist than the insiders and experts. What the climate journalist Emily Atkin calls “first-time climate dudes” put forth long, breathless magazine articles, bestselling books and films announcing that it’s too late and we’re doomed, which is another way to say we don’t have to do a damned thing, which is a way to undermine the people who are doing those things and those who might be moved to do them. The climate scientist Michael Mann takes these people on – he calls them inactivists and doomists – in his recent book The New Climate Wars, which describes the defeatism that has succeeded outright climate denial as the great obstacle to addressing the crisis. He echoes what Carbon Tracker asserted, writing: “The solution is already here. We just need to deploy it rapidly and at a massive scale. It all comes down to political will and economic incentives.” The climate scientist Diana Liverman shares Mann’s frustration. She was part of the international team of scientists who authored the 2018 “hothouse Earth” study whose conclusions were boiled down, by the media, into “we have 12 years”. The report, she regularly points out, also described what we can and must do “to steer the Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a habitable interglacial-like state. Such action entails stewardship of the entire Earth System – biosphere, climate, and societies – and could include decarbonization of the global economy, enhancement of biosphere carbon sinks, behavioral changes, technological innovations, new governance arrangements, and transformed social values.” It was a warning but also a promise that if we did what science tells us we must, we would not preserve the current order but form a better one. Another expert voice for hope is Christiana Figueres, who as executive secretary of the United Nations framework convention on climate change negotiated the Paris climate accords in 2015. As she recently declared: “This decade is a moment of choice unlike any we have ever lived. All of us alive right now share that responsibility and that opportunity. The optimism I’m speaking of is not the result of an achievement, it is the necessary input to meeting a challenge. Many now believe it is impossible to cut global emissions in half in this decade. I say, we don’t have the right to give up or let up.” She speaks of how impossible a treaty like the one she negotiated seemed after the shambles at the end of the 2009 Copenhagen meeting. The visionary organizer adrienne maree brown wrote not long ago: “I believe that all organizing is science fiction – that we are shaping the future we long for and have not yet experienced. I believe that we are in an imagination battle …” All these voices have taken the side of hope in the imagination battle, offering choices and possibilities and the responsibilities that come with those things, as does the actual science fiction in The Ministry for the Future, which takes a turn for the utopian by the end. When I began reading it, apocalyptic news seemed to chime in with the novel. But as I finished it I ran across stories about Scotland’s plans to rewild much of its land, which could have come from the book. And I saw the astonishing news that on the afternoon of Saturday 24 April, California got more than 90% of its energy from renewables. That we cannot see all the way to the transformed society we need does not mean it is impossible. We will reach it by not one great leap but a long journey, step by step. If we see how impossible our current reality might have seemed 20 years ago – that solar would be so cheap, that Scotland would get 97% of its electricity from renewables, that fossil fuel corporations would be in freefall – we can trust that we could be moving toward an even more transformed and transformative future, and that it is not a set destination but, for better or worse, what we are making up as we go. Each shift makes more shifts possible. But only if we go actively toward the possibilities rather than passively into the collapse. Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Friday, tomorrow, is decarbonisation and industry day, so the events will be themed around that topic. The US president, Joe Biden, is heading to Egypt and Asia right now. He’s expected to drop into Cop27 tomorrow before going on to the East Asia Summit in Cambodia and then the annual G20 in Indonesia. It will be interesting to see how that galvanises the discussions. Significant developments today included: Khaled Ali, the lawyer of the imprisoned hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah, has said he went to the prison where his client was being held but was denied access to visit him. More than 50 of the poorest developing countries are in danger of defaulting on their debt and becoming effectively bankrupt unless the rich world offers urgent assistance, Achim Steiner, the head of the UN Development Programme has warned. There is a record number of fossil fuel lobbyists at Cop this year. There are 600 of them, an increase of more than 25% on last year and they outnumber any one frontline community affected by the climate crisis. Obviously, protesters are not happy about this and called for the “criminal” fossil fuel representatives to be booted out of Cop. Some UK politicians made the rounds, with net zero tsar Chris Skidmore fitting in no less than six events. The business secretary, Grant Shapps, was there too, answering questions about UK oil and gas exploration, and the Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, addressed a couple of panels. Our colleague Damian Carrington brought us two pieces of good news: first that Israel, Lebanon and Iraq have teamed up to reduce emissions, and that Norway is shutting down plans for a large oilfield. The US speaker, Nancy Pelosi, made some rather extraordinary comments in which she said Republican politicians believe climate breakdown is a “hoax”. Slovenia is the latest in a long line of European countries to quit the energy charter treaty, which gives energy companies the right to sue governments. Guardian reporter Nina Lakhani spent much of the day with protesters, who were wearing white in solidarity with murdered and jailed environment defenders around the world. Egypt is responsible for a few of those imprisonments, notably the hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah. We’ll be blogging again bright and early tomorrow – see you then! There is widespread cynicism that the high-level negotiations between dignitaries at Cop27 will lead to significant progress on tackling the climate crisis, new polling suggests. According to a survey of 4,800 people in 12 countries, 86% agreed there was a need for urgent action to address the crisis, but only 22% believed anything would be achieved at Sharm-el-Sheikh. As diplomats, dignitaries, activists and executives from around the world gathered in Egypt, the pollsters at Kantar interviewed people in the UK, Egypt, USA, Spain, Italy, India, Germany, France, Colombia, China, Brazil and Australia to find out their feelings about and expectations of the summit. They found that two out of three people had heard of Cop, but that only a third of people were really familiar with the aims of the meeting. Four out of five people said global, collective and concerted action was important to tackle climate change. Of the themes on the COP27 agenda, renewable energy and energy transformation was regarded as most important, Kantar said, followed by sustainable water resource management, adaptation and agriculture, and biodiversity. Ecosystem scientist Friedrich Bohn has been in touch from Sharm El-Sheikh. Bohn (who is also a father to young children) is, like so many, deeply worried about the path we are currently on. He says: New evidence suggests that multiple tipping points could be triggered if global temperatures rise more than 1.5°C. However, with current policies, we are heading for a temperature rise of 2.8 °C. This would trigger more and dramatic tipping elements, whose healthy state is central to the stability of the Earth system. We must avoid this world at all costs and lay the financial foundations for this at this COP. His colleagues released a report today which pulled out 10 insights into climate science. The report concludes that “climate change is already exacerbating other risks, such as conflict, pandemics, and food disruption, and will further exacerbate them”. But Dr Bohn does see some cause for hope. “Structural barriers have led to stalled policies, economies, and societies, driving resource extraction and emissions ever higher. Positive change can be accelerated through progressive social movements, new forms of governance, and appropriate policy tools. We can still create a fair, healthy, safe, and clean future if we have the political will to embrace new economic paradigms that can unlock our potential to decarbonize.” Inarguable. Away from the conference, it’s now been announced that Slovenia is the latest is a long line of European countries to quit the energy charter treaty, which gives energy companies the right to sue governments. Jean Blaylock, trade campaigner at Global Justice Now says: “It’s very welcome news that Slovenia is quitting this climate-wrecking treaty which remains a major obstacle to anything agreed at Cop27. With the Netherlands, Spain and Poland also heading out the door, the ECT is nothing more than a sinking ship, after countless attempts to reform it have failed. “This little-known treaty is being used by fossil fuel companies to sue governments over climate action. The Netherlands is being sued for billions over its coal phaseout plans by two energy firms, RWE and Uniper. “Attempts to reform the ECT have ended up as mere greenwash, which would keep fossil fuel companies protected for ten more years – a decade that is crucial for the transition away from fossil fuels. Now governments are voting with their feet to protect future action. The UK government needs to join the rush for the exit and ditch this treaty now.” My colleague, environment correspondent Damien Gayle, has written about a “global wave of actions against private aviation timed to coincide with the Cop27 climate talks”, in which activists in 13 countries, including the UK, Germany, Italy and Australia, have been blocking entrances to private jet airports. The campaign, led by Extinction Rebellion and Scientist Rebellion in the UK, says it is “targeting the climate destroying, jet-setting life-styles of billionaires and multimillionaires that are exacerbating climate breakdown”. Gayle references data from FlightRadar which showed 36 private jets landed at Sharm el-Sheikh between 4 and 6 November, and writes: The climate activists said they were calling on dignitaries gathering at Cop27 to ban the use of private jets, “which are five to 14 times more polluting per passenger than commercial planes, and 50 times more polluting than trains”.

Some weeks our correspondents focus in on the key issue of the day, while in others we have guest columnists, such as Daisy Dunne and Josh Gabbatiss in our most recent mail-out. Good afternoon, I’m Bibi van der Zee, and I’m taking over from Natalie Hanman. Please send stories and thoughts to bibi.vanderzee@theguardian.com, or @bibivanderzee. Greta Thunberg has responded to the analysis that Global Witness released earlier today, showing the number of fossil fuel lobbyists at Cop27 is higher than at Cop26 in Glasgow. It’s up more than 25% apparently, and outnumbers almost every country delegation group except for the United Arab Emirates, which has registered 1,070 delegates. Thunberg says: “If you want to address malaria, you don’t invite the mosquitoes.” But some of the comments below disagree – in a fairly polite manner. Khaled Ali, the lawyer of the imprisoned hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah, has said he went to the prison where his client was being held but was denied access to visit him. Ali has been unable to get access to see Abd el-Fattah since early 2020, when the British-Egyptian democracy activist was detained without charge after a spate of anti-corruption demonstrations in Egypt. The veteran human rights lawyer and former Egyptian presidential candidate said earlier today he was suddenly informed by Egypt’s public prosecutor that his repeated requests to visit his client had been granted, and he immediately set off for the desert prison two hours outside of Cairo. When he arrived, he said he was told by guards that the prosecutor’s permission dated from last night, and that he was required to have permission to enter from the same day. Abd el-Fattah was sentenced last year for “spreading false news” after sharing a social media post about torture. His defence lawyers including Ali were not given access to his case file before the ruling, which led to him being given a further five years in prison. A figurehead of the 2011 uprisings, Abd el-Fattah began a hunger strike in April in protest at his detention conditions amid increasing demands from British officials to be granted access to him. Egypt has stonewalled these requests. After six months on hunger strike, Abd el-Fattah told his family he would stop drinking water on the day that Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh began. Earlier today, prison officials told his family the had “undergone a medical intervention with the knowledge of a judicial authority”, suggesting he had been subject to either force-feeding or intravenous rehydration without his consent, a form of torture. Some food for thought: An interesting video here, where activist Ulaiasi Tuikoro explains why loss and damage funds are important for Fiji. Ulaiasi Tuikoro, a young activist from Fiji, who has been demonstrating at Cop27 said loss and damage is “everything about me”. “I have lost a lot. I’ve lived through many cyclones. It’s hard to recover from that so for me loss and damage is everything I am.” Tuikoro said not everyone is paying their fair share and loss and damage would help save “whatever we have left”. “In the Pacific we’ve got this culture of not wanting to complain a lot, but we’re not complaining, we are demanding our place and survival. “We have tears of resilience [...] and are pleading to our world leaders to save what we can.” In Fiji, the climate crisis means dozens of villages could soon be underwater. Kate Lyon’s writes on how to move a country. In our morning news meeting (interrupted somewhat by the shaky wifi in the Cop conference centre), we discussed how the negotiations were developing, and what we might expect at the end. Now Simon Evans, the incredibly expert deputy editor at Carbon Brief, has posted that “consultations on the all-important ‘cover text’ won’t begin until Saturday”, according to the Cop presidency briefing. The Guardian’s environment editor, Fiona Harvey, wrote about the details of the Cop26 Glasgow Climate Pact at the time. Please do send thoughts or questions to me, Natalie Hanman, head of environment at the Guardian: natalie.hanman@theguardian.com or @nataliehanman. I’ll be on the blog for the next few hours. Thank you. Our picture editors have selected some of the best photographs taken so far at Cop today. Telling stories through images is an important part of the Guardian’s journalism, and lots of research shows the power of photographs to define how the climate emergency “is understood and acted upon”. Our head of photography, Fiona Shields, has written about that previously here. I am signing off for the afternoon and my colleague Natalie Hanman is taking over to guide you through events into this evening. It’s been a colourful day so far at Cop27 and there will be more news to come, so stay tuned to Natalie’s updates. There is a record number of fossil fuel lobbyists at Cop this year. There are 600 of them, an increase of more than 25% on last year and they outnumber any one frontline community affected by the climate crisis. Obviously, protesters are not happy about this and called for the “criminal” fossil fuel representatives to be booted out of Cop. Some UK politicians made the rounds, with net zero tsar Chris Skidmore fitting in no less than six events. The business secretary, Grant Shapps, was there, too, answering questions about UK oil and gas exploration, and the Cop26 president Alok Sharma addressed a couple of panels. My colleague Damian Carrington brought us two pieces of good news; first that Israel, Lebanon and Iraq have teamed up to reduce emissions, and that Norway is shutting down plans for a large oilfield. The US speaker, Nancy Pelosi, made some rather extraordinary comments in which she said Republican politicians believe climate breakdown is a “hoax”. Guardian reporter Nina Lakhani spent much of the day with protesters, who were wearing white in solidarity with murdered and jailed environment defenders around the world. Egypt is responsible for a few of those imprisonments, notably the hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah. My other colleague Ruth Michaelson reported that his lawyer managed to secure a visit with Abd el-Fattah today, who, it has been rumoured, was recently force-fed. Have a great rest of the afternoon; our team will be reporting from Cop for the duration, with a daily live blog and lots of news stories to keep you up to date on all the developments. It’s the younger people in the world who will bear the brunt of much of the climate emergency. Many world leaders are at an age where they will probably not be alive by 2050, the net zero emissions target. So today is Youth Day at Cop27, and youth climate activists and practitioners have taken place in a round table with delegates from around the globe. One young person who was not seen today is Greta Thunberg, who has said she will not be attending the “greenwashing” summit. “The Cops are mainly used as an opportunity for leaders and people in power to get attention, using many different kinds of greenwashing,” she said earlier this autumn. We’ve been hearing a lot of debates about what exactly loss and damage is. Ulaiasi Tuikoro, a youth activist from Fiji, who has been demonstrating at Cop27, says “it’s everything about me”. “I have lost a lot. I’ve lived through many cyclones. It’s hard to recover from that so for me loss and damage is everything I am.” Tuikoro says that not everyone is paying their fair share for the injustices they have perpetuated and that loss and damage will help save “whatever we have left”. “In the Pacific we’ve got this culture of not wanting to complain a lot, but we’re not complaining, we are demanding our place and survival. “We have tears of resilience and our pleading to our world leaders to save what we can.” In Fiji, the climate crisis means dozens of villages could soon be under water. Relocating so many communities is an epic undertaking. But now there is a plan. Read my colleague Kate Lyon’s piece on how to move a country. It is hard to find good news on the climate crisis at Cop27 and in particular on keeping fossil fuels in the ground, as scientists have repeatedly said must happen. But most delegates here will be cheered by the news that Norway’s oil company has postponed development of the world’s most northerly oilfield exploitation. The Wisting field would be a $10bn project, but has been put on ice for four years. The company blamed a “cost increase due to increased global inflation” and “uncertainty about the framework conditions for the project”. Campaigners claimed the move as a victory. Equinor has been under pressure in Norway over the project and the field may now never be exploited, with some analysts expecting oil demand to peak soon. Arild Hermstad, leader of Norway’s Green party, told the Guardian: “We are celebrating the good news today. But as long as the Norwegian government does not make a political announcement to stop all new exploration, our credibility as a climate leader at the ongoing climate talks in Egypt is nonexistent.” Tessa Khan, director of Uplift, said: “Even if Equinor puts the decision down to rising costs, this is a victory for the climate. Equinor spends a lot on PR telling people that it is transitioning away from oil and gas, but in reality it is planning to develop huge new oil and gas projects.” UN secretary general, António Guterres, told Cop27 on Tuesday: “Using bogus ‘net zero’ pledges to cover up massive fossil fuel expansion is reprehensible. This toxic coverup could push our world over the climate cliff.” Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, has appeared at Cop27, telling an event it is “hard to speak” about the midterm elections in the US, which could still see Republicans take narrow control of the chamber. Pelosi, wearing a US and Ukraine flag pin, said that Democrats and Republicans have had “as you would say a disagreement on this issue, they all say it’s a hoax and we’ve got to get past that. This is urgent, this is overdue”. She added: “We have to save all the children, it’s a moral issue. We can’t have political disagreements over this or let the fossil fuel industry cramp our style. The need is great enough and the urgency is clear enough.” Pelosi would not dwell on the midterms, which could oust her from her speaker role, but did lament that the US chartered two flights for lawmakers to head to the talks in Egypt, but found little interest due to the elections. It’s likely Republican control of the House would stymie any further climate bills or climate funding for developing countries. Kathy Castor, chair of the House subcommittee on the climate crisis, spoke alongside Pelosi and said Republicans would “nix” the committee should they gain power. The family of the jailed British-Egyptian political prisoner and hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah say that prison authorities informed them he has “undergone a medical intervention with the knowledge of a judicial authority”. Abd el-Fattah’s mother, the activist Laila Soueif, was prevented from waiting outside Wadi al-Natrun prison where the democracy activist is believed to be held for a fourth day, as the Egyptian authorities refuse to provide further information or allow communication between the jailed democracy activist and his family. His family said: Wadi al-Natrun prison officials today refused to allow Laila Soueif to wait at the prison gates. They refused to take receipt of a letter she had written to the prison governor and one to Alaa. They informed her that Alaa had “undergone a medical intervention with the knowledge of a judicial authority”. We are demanding information on the substance of the “medical intervention” and demanding that with the utmost urgency he is moved to a hospital where lawyers and family can reach him. Figures from the respected al-Nadim Centre for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence puts the number of prisoners who have died in Egypt’s prisons this year alone at 40 prisoners. The latest was Ala al-Salmi, 47, who died in Badr 3 prison at the end of October. Mr al-Salmi had been on hunger strike. The statement from the prison authorities suggests Abd el-Fattah has either been forced fed, forced to accept intravenous fluids or another form of medical treatment he did not consent to, following six months of hunger strike and a water strike that he began on the day Cop27 commenced in Sharm el-Sheikh. His sister, Sanaa Seif, who is attending Cop27, told the Guardian earlier this week that “force-feeding is torture, and nothing should happen that is against Alaa’s will”. The author Omar Robert Hamilton, Abd el-Fattah’s cousin, said: “This news is seriously worrying. I am not comforted at all and believe he is still at massive risk. The Egyptian authorities are totally opaque, cruel, incompetent, corrupt and so paralysed by fear that information doesn’t travel along chains of command properly – so anything could happen. After being on hunger strike for seven months Alaa’s body is in an incredibly precarious state and the wrong intervention could have terrible consequences. This is against his will, illegal and inhumane. We don’t even know if he is in a hospital or still inside the prison. The cruelty is unfathomable.” His lawyer Khaled Ali said that he was suddenly granted access to visit him Wadi al Natrun prison for the first time. Ali tweeted that he is currently en route to the prison to visit the activist after receiving permission to do so from Egypt’s public prosecutor. All of Ali’s previous requests have been denied or ignored, while Egyptian officials have stonewalled ongoing efforts by British consular officials to get access to the campaigner, after repeatedly failing to recognise his dual nationality. For those interested in what the UK government is up to, Cop-wise, I received this from environment secretary Thérèse Coffey’s team: She is going to Cop seeking to maintain the momentum we started at Cop26 by championing nature-based solutions. She’ll be holding bilaterals and joining events to call for ambitious pledges to be met with ambitious action. She will be there from Monday until Wednesday. However, it might be difficult for her to command respect at the bilaterals considering she very recently admitted to breaching the government’s own Environment Act by missing the deadline to post clean air and water targets. Perhaps getting those out in the open could be a “nature-based solution”. Gloria Ocampo, Berta Caceres, Marielle Franco, Liliana Peña Chocué, Macarena Valdés, Amaya Morales – just a few of the thousands of murdered environmental and human rights defenders whose names were read at the biggest and most emotive protest at Cop27 so far. A couple of hundred people gathered wearing white clothes in solidarity with the murdered and jailed defenders around the world who put their bodies on the line to save the planet, but whose voices are missing from Cop27 and the wider fight for climate and social justice. Each person’s name was followed by an emotive shout of “not yet defeated”. The sobering name call was followed by half a minute of silence, after which speakers from the US, Malaysia, Philippines, South Africa and occupied first nation land in what’s known as Canada, called out the UNFCCC and country states for pushing market-driven solutions while denying frontline communities a seat at the table. “Stop lying to the people. Move away from carbon credits and other false solutions,” said Siawatu-Salama Ra from Michigan. “It is not a crime to want affordable safe water or clean air to breathe. Free all prisoners, free them all, free him, free him,” she said, apparently referring to the Egyptian-British jailed hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah whose fate is unknown. Some of the biggest cheers came during the impassioned speech from 29-year-old Zukiswa White from South Africa, who connected dots between the wealth of the rich global north and the degradation and poverty of the global south. “We are still paying for their development, as if their countries were not built off of our backs. We don’t need to know how to take care and nurture our land from those who have destroyed and degraded our land, culture and heritage. That is why we are here at Cop27. If we keep moving in the logic of white supremacy and racist development projects, our kids will be here at Cop100.” White read out a quote from Fikile Ntshangase, a South African activist who fought against a coal mine: “I refused to sign, I cannot sell out my people. If need be, I will die for my people.” Fikile Ntshangase was murdered in 2020. In a rare example of climate change concerns taking priority over political hostility, Israel, Lebanon and Iraq have agreed along with other nations to work together to tackle global heating, according to the New Arab website and other reports. Israel is still officially at war with Lebanon and bans its citizens from having any contact with Israelis, while Israel and Iraq have no diplomatic relations due to a history of hostilities. “The countries of the region share the warming and drying climate and just as they share the problems they can and must share the solutions. No country can stand alone in the face of the climate crisis,” said Tamar Zandberg, Israel’s outgoing environmental protection minister. However, the office of Lebanon’s prime minister Najib Mikati, played down any wider significance of the meeting at Cop27, saying it was attended by a large number of Arab and international officials: “There was no contact whatsoever with any Israeli official.” The Haaretz newspaper said that, according to sources, this is the first high-level regional meeting on climate change that Israel is taking part in. Israel and Jordan also signed a memorandum of understanding at Cop27 to move ahead with their water-for-energy deal, first announced a year ago. In the proposal, Jordan will build 600 megawatts of solar power capacity to export electricity to Israel in exchange for 200 million cubic meters of desalinated water. A brilliant picture here of everyone wearing white in solidarity with murdered land defenders and political prisoners. British-Egyptian jailed hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah is in the thoughts of many at the protest. The 40-year-old pro-democracy writer and activist has been behind bars in Egypt for most of the past decade. His friend, the actor Khalid Abdalla, who plays Dodi Fayed in Netflix show The Crown, posted the pictures and said: “If only Alaa could see this”. In case you have time to watch this – or bookmark it for elevenses – our excellent Fiona Harvey has fronted a Guardian documentary about Cop27. She’s arguably one of the leading Cop experts in the world and has excellent insights, as well as contacts. She gives an overview of the last 30 years of Cops, and asks presidents, global leaders, activists and scientists if global diplomacy is enough to save humanity from the brink of annihilation. The Cop26 president Alok Sharma’s had a busy morning, speaking at two different events, one on decarbonising education and another at the UK pavilion about how businesses can hit climate targets. He said: “Businesses continue to step up work and ambition to make 1.5C a reality.” We promised you the full story on fossil fuel lobbyists, and here it is. There are more than 600 fossil fuel lobbyists at the Cop27 climate conference, a rise of more than 25% from last year and outnumbering any one frontline community affected by the climate crisis. My colleague Ruth Michaelson has the story: Which countries have sent the most delegates to Cop27? Carbon Brief has done an interesting analysis into who has sent the most delegates to the conference. By far the top country is the UAE, which has sent more than 1,000 (compared to the UK, which has sent under 100). The UAE is followed by Brazil which has sent 574. The deep dive is great and worth reading in full but it is also interesting to note that Cops have become more gender-balanced over time. Its analysis reads: While the average delegation at Cop1 was 88% male and 12% female, this has shifted over time. For example, Cops 23 to 25 all had an average gender balance of 62% male to 38% female, while Cop26 had a balance of 64%-36%. The provisional gender balance of Cop27 is similar, clocking it at 63% male to 37% female. The major breaking news story at Cop27 this morning is that water and fizzy drinks are now free and food is half price after delegates struggled to find enough to eat or drink in the first few days of the summit. The move has been welcomed with cautious optimism by attendees in Egypt, who have previously complained that the limited food and drink is being sold at New York and London prices. “Having been to these Cops for quite a time, good food is always a problem. If you don’t provide good food, you won’t get a good outcome,” said one lady in a queue. “We are not really Coca-Cola drinkers but it’s the only choice. The water is still not so available. You can’t find it easily,” added an attendee who was enjoying a bottle of the fizzy drink after the rule change. Another delegate was delighted by the price change, but feared supply issues would not improve. “I didn’t each lunch yesterday because the queues were too long and I wanted to get to my meetings. It’s not going to change in the next two days,” she said. While we wait for more information from negotiations and panels, I have what may be a contender for Cop-related “quote of the day”. The UK environment minister Trudy Harrison has rebuked her colleagues for saying that the country is the most nature depleted in the world. “It is not correct to say that we are the most nature-depleted country in the world,” she told MPs. “Depending on the measure, we are 142nd out of 201.” World-beating stuff! There are a lot of interesting protests happening today, from a woman in an embellished outfit which proclaims ‘the flood is coming’, to the vegans who have been there each day (a lot of the food on offer seems to be beef and chicken based). Though the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, hotfooted it back to England pretty swiftly after his underwhelming speech to the conference on Monday, there are still a handful of politicians knocking around. Chris Skidmore, the UK’s net zero tsar, is speaking at six different events during Cop, and seems to be thoroughly enjoying his time in Sharm El-Sheikh. He tells me: I am delighted to be at Cop27 as part of the UK delegation and to speak about the net zero review and the progress we have made. So far the review has held 38 evidence roundtables and been taking evidence from across the UK – along with receiving over 1,800 written evidence submissions. I’m keen to maintain the level of collaboration internationally, to demonstrate that the UK remains internationally leading in our climate policies and the review is a fantastic opportunity to establish new policies and frameworks that can ensure we can go further and faster on emissions reductions – and show other nations how they can deliver and implement their own net zero targets. I will be speaking at the UK pavilion for several events and also addressing separately the Climate Leadership Summit, the UK corporate leaders group and a number of events on how to build collaboration and demonstrate the wider society benefits of what net zero can achieve for local communities. Also at the conference is the business secretary, Grant Shapps, who has been snapped posing up a storm with other delegates in between fielding questions about how exactly the UK plans to be ‘world leading’ on climate while exploiting more north sea oil and gas against climate change committee recommendations. I’m also told that Thérèse Coffey, the UK’s environment secretary, is heading down soon with her team to speak to the conference about nature-based solutions. Perhaps we will hear more about the plans for nature friendly farming payments – currently on ice – and how we can be world leaders on this issue when there are currently hundreds of environment laws at risk from being lost from the statute book due to Brexit. As news broke of the 600+ fossil fuel lobbyists at this year’s summit, climate justice activists from Asia, Africa, and the Americas protested in the main courtyard in the blue zone demanding that the UNFCCC kick polluters out from Cop. “We are here representing millions of people who are demanding that the polluters be kicked out of the Cop space and policy making. For more than half a century they kept the truth about the harms from the people. They delayed action because of greed. You can let the criminals set the rules, we have to reset the system. We are calling them out,” said Aderonke Lge from Public Participation Africa. Nishant Kumar Alag from India added: “We call them polluters and violators, but we’re talking about criminals. We demand the right to clean water, air and land, and no safe haven for the criminals.” As the delegates rushed past, heads down en route to another long day in the main negotiating rooms and event spaces, the protesters sang: “All we are saying is kick polluters out.” Lots of people are wearing white today in solidarity with the thousands of land and environmental defenders killed and criminalised around the world, and with the tens and thousands of political prisoners here in Egypt and around the world. Exorbiant hotel and travel costs, visa delays and accreditation limits have made access to Cop27 incredibly challenging for activists and grassroots leaders including those from Africa – despite this being dubbed the African Cop. Gina Cortes Valderrama from Colombia said lobbyists were everywhere while those on the frontline of the climate crisis cannot get access to Cop. “It’s a clear signal of what the colonial structures here value and prioritise.” As US officials including John Kerry hold events at the climate justice pavilion – a space and term that activists say polluters and their allies are trying to co-opt, a host of protests and actions are planned in the blue zone. A new analysis by the groups Global Witness, Corporate Europe Observatory and Corporate Accountability has calculated that 636 fossil fuel lobbyists are registered to attend Cop27. This is up more than 25% from last year, and the number is larger than any single national delegation except the United Arab Emirates, they report. The UAE, who will host Cop28 next year, have an astonishing 1,070 delegates in attendance, up from 176 last year. We’ll have a story shortly, but in the meantime you can read the Global Witness report here. What to look out for at Cop27 today Good morning from a blustery Sharm El-Sheikh. Here is what to look out on youth day at Cop27: Nancy Pelosi will speak at the climate summit at around 11:15am London time in what might be one of her last appearances as House speaker in the US. It comes after a better than expected performance by the Democrats in the midterm elections, but it seems like they are on course to lose control of the House of Representatives. Several youth-led events will be held throughout the day, including intergenerational panels on loss and damage, mitigation and a just transition. Yesterday evening, the sister of the jailed hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah was informed that a pro-government lawyer has filed a case against her with the Egyptian public prosecutor accusing her of espionage and “spreading false news” after she spoke earlier this week at Cop27, reported the Guardian’s Ruth Michaelson and Patrick Wintour. Activists are wearing white today at Cop27 in solidarity with murdered land defenders and political prisoners, with protests planned throughout the day. UK business secretary Grant Shapps is at the climate summit where he is likely to face questions about North sea oil and gas and onshore wind. Good morning, and welcome to the Guardian’s rolling coverage of Cop27. Our team in Sharm el-Sheikh will be sending through updates and reports. After the first two days were dedicated largely to world leaders’ speeches, yesterday the negotiations began in earnest. You can read a roundup of the main points here: The UN has posted today’s programme of meetings and events here – we will bring you news from the most important and interesting ones.

Since Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr had their iconic beach-side bunk-up in 1953’s From Here to Eternity, one of the most familiar themes in pop culture is that of a sexy seaside paradise populated by the young, good-looking and impervious to sunburn. Lorde’s lavish Solar Power is the latest to sell that same dream, as the returning pop star prances over sand dunes in yellow silk (without a single sweat stain!) flanked by toned pals freshly out of a Timotei ad. Yet, as M Night Shyamalan’s new horror film Old – with its tale of a rapidly ageing family trapped in paradise – shows, the most indelible depictions of the beach are often far from the romanticised cliches, offering something weirder and deeper instead: take Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’s stark seaside locations, or Massimo Vitali’s washed-out photos of European sun-traps. Here are some of the most beguiling cultural examples. Dive in. LC Wildwood, NJ Dirs: Carol Weaks Cassidy, Ruth Leitman Long before the brash reality show Jersey Shore there was Wildwood, NJ, an hour-long 1994 documentary that looked at a summer spent on the blue-collar east coast of the US. Focusing on a cross-generational sweep of women and girls in the early 1990s – and made with an all-female crew – this is not some macho Bruce Springsteen song, but rather a look at the rarely documented lives of working-class American women. In a warmly rendered riot of funfairs, flings and the occasional flick knife, it’s the giddy, gum-snapping teenagers who own the film, with their tightly scraped ponytails, crop tops, giant hoop earrings and springy Noo Joisey accents. There is snogging on the boardwalk, slow dancing by the arcades, much reclining on sun loungers and awkward retellings of early sexual experiences at the seaside resort, as well as frank discussions of abortion and violence. “We need to pray for them,” sighs an elderly woman as her gaggle of Golden Girls pals shake their heads. But as joyful as the film often is, Wildwood, NJ is tinged with sadness, because rather than a summer – and a youth – spent on the beach that never ends, this is one that everyone involved knows will soon be over. LC Wild Swimming Marek Horn In Marek Horn’s play Wild Swimming, we are the sea. Sometimes the two actors cross the boundary and leap around into us. At other times, they keep their toes tucked in, away from the water’s edge. This disarmingly charming two-hander follows Oscar (Annabel Baldwin) and Nell (Alice Lamb) over four centuries, from the late 16th century onwards. Returning again and again to the same wind-whipped beach in Dorset, the two friends argue and flirt their way through 400 years. Their costumes and interests and dreams change with the times, while they age at an infinitesimal pace compared with their surroundings. Hurtling through time, Horn uses the beach as a space to toy with privilege and power, with Nell increasingly furious at Oscar’s freedoms as a young man, while she isn’t even able to swim in public. Presented by the company FullRogue, Wild Swimming sold out at the Edinburgh fringe in 2019 and returns to Bristol this summer. It is a joyful, audacious show, and Oscar and Nell’s friendship is addictive. Even after 400 years, we want them to keep coming back to us on the shore. KW Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Dir: Michel Gondry It is Valentine’s Day 2004. Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) skives from work to go and wallow on a snowy, hostile beach in Montauk, New York. “Sand is overrated,” he thinks. “It’s just tiny little rocks.” Clearly, Barish hasn’t read much William Blake recently. When he spots a woman wearing an orange sweater, standing alone by the ocean, the film’s focus on the granular yet monumental nature of memory becomes apparent. Barish and Clementine (Kate Winslet) meet as if for the first time, but they have been here before. As it transpires that each elected to have the other erased from their memory after a failed relationship, they try to outwit the scientists wiping their slate clean, racing through Barish’s psyche in search of a place to hide. It is futile: characters and details vanish from their every refuge. The beach house they broke into on their first meeting crumbles away, leaving only the pair lying in bed on the beach – a beautiful, hopeless shot. Strikingly, their romantic memories are full of banalities and bickering – no love for the ages. But these disparate specks add up to something that neither is ready to relinquish. Clementine’s reappearance – emotional flotsam on the shore – suggests no one ever really lets go. LS Southern Comfort’s Whatever’s Comfortable advert Pop culture always gets beaches wrong because it represents them as a place where you can be fun and happy and energetic and eat good food. I have never in my life been to a beach like that. This is because of what the beach does to you: the pure, unfiltered, pummel of sunshine; fine sand, everywhere; sweat mixed with sweat mixed with suntan lotion. At the beach, you do not frolic in the waves, or strum a guitar round a fire pit, or “play volleyball”; you wallow like a whale in soup, then get up, with a headache, and realise it’s still somehow only 4pm. This is why the 2012 advert where a man with a proto-mullet, a small pair of swimming trunks, a deep, mahogany tan and some 70s porn baron sunglasses ambles across a beach in search of Southern Comfort is the closest thing to showing what a beach really is: walking thickly over thin sand, nodding sleepily to anyone who notices you, heading in the direction of a cold drink. We go to the beach to see a little glimpse of what awaits us between limbo and hell. The only accurate representation of the beach in human history is a slightly-too-long advert for a bourbon-flavoured liqueur. No One Direction video even comes close. JG The Last of Us Part II Naughty Dog (PS4/5) With its post-apocalyptic adventure game series The Last of Us, developer Naughty Dog showed an unnerving talent for subverting idyllic landscapes for horrific impact. Zoos, country houses, theme parks: all are transformed into twisted hellscapes, populated by savage infected killers. Perhaps the greatest example of this talent is the developer’s use of a beach for the climactic fight between – SPOILER ALERT – Ellie and Abby at the close of The Last of Us Part II. Shrouded in fog, the sea black and uninviting, it’s like your worst ever seaside holiday, except here you are also expected to murder your arch-enemy. Abby’s aim is to clamber onboard a nearby boat and row away to safety – a pitch-dark take on the image of the coast as a place of escape – but there is no way Ellie, our surviving protagonist from the first game, is going to let her leave without a fight. So many video games, from Super Mario Sunshine to Dead Or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball, have given us stereotypical beach scenes. The Last of Us II, on the other hand, makes the beach feel like not just the end of land but the end of the world itself. KS Pure Shores All Saints There is something deeply 2021 relatable about the video for All Saints’ majestic dream-pop classic Pure Shores, taken from Leonardo DiCaprio’s 2000 vehicle The Beach. In the equivalent of a big, saved-up-for-years family holiday being downgraded to a caravan in Rhyl, All Saints are shunted from the film’s scenic Thailand locale to Holkham beach in Norfolk. In January. They trudge around like moody teens in heavy duty winter wear, two of them trying to inject some excitement by running in sand, AKA the hardest, most pointless form of exercise. At times they are filmed in terrifying nightvision, a technique one reviewer said made them look like “hopelessly dazed raccoons”. In the context of the aborted holiday narrative, it feels like that moment you hit peak boredom – beaches, in winter, are tedious – and you start scrolling through your phone for “arty” social media filters with which to endlessly annoy everyone. The sandy scenes are intercut with sections filmed in Norfolk beach huts, supposedly to replicate Leo et al’s sweat-drenched digs in Ko Phi Phi Le, but each band member just looks relieved to be out of the wind. Basically, the beach backdrop here feels taunting, a constant reminder of what happens when plans are ruined. MC John from Cincinnati (Now TV) “Watch your feet,” mutters seasoned surfer Mitch Yost (Bruce Greenwood) as he schleps a board back to his car with a starstruck female fan, “I stepped on a syringe here yesterday.” It’s fair to say that John from Cincinnati – which notoriously debuted on HBO immediately after the final episode of The Sopranos in 2007 – did not overly romanticise its setting: Imperial Beach, a hardscrabble Californian city within yomping distance of the Mexican border. Created by Deadwood’s David Milch and surf-noir author Kem Nunn, this one-season curio rejected the glossy, turquoise-blue screensaver aesthetic of much beach-related TV to present something grittier and more confounding. The titular dude is a miracle-inducing stranger who upends the surfers, scum-bums and various orbiting eccentrics. But is the naive John Monad (Austin Nichols) an angel, an alien or just a kook? Viewers and critics may have struggled to connect with the drama’s wilfully cryptic vibe. But whenever the action reverts to catching waves – made easier by casting actual surfers such as teen champ Greyson Fletcher – the show finds a more blissful, spiritual groove. For the sweetest hit, just dip into the sublime credits sequence, a scratchy montage of breakers soundtracked by Joe Strummer. GV Massimo Vitali Massimo Vitali photographs Italian summer beaches with a sensual yet uneasy eye. From Sicily to Liguria, all his epic shots seem to find the same empty sunlight shining on a panorama of human detail that is both comic and flat. Crowded shores pack people big and small, cool and uncool on white sand and water-kissed rocks. These scenes should be idyllic but something is wrong. It’s all too perfect. Here are Italians blissing out in the infinite light, seeking a summer paradise. On every beach it’s the same fantasy, the same crowd – for we all behave in a ritual, preset way in this rush for a modern dream. Perhaps Vitali, from a Catholic culture, is mocking the cult of beauty in a post-religious Europe. Perhaps he sees images of corporatism and corruption in these bleached-out gatherings. His photos echo some of the ironic beach scenes of Italian cinema from Fellini’s seedy Rimini to Visconti’s panorama of the Venice Lido as Dirk Bogarde dies in voyeuristic ecstasy. The beach is a place where modern, secular dreams die in the glint of sun on water, suggests this heir to the neo-realists. Still, I wouldn’t mind being on one of those beaches right now.

A new report on the world’s electricity generation revealed the steepest cut in carbon emissions since 1990 as the US and the EU turned to cleaner energy sources. Overall, power from coal plants fell by 3% last year, even as China’s reliance on coal plants climbed for another year to make up half the world’s coal generation for the first time. Coal generation in the US and Europe has halved since 2007, and last year collapsed by almost a quarter in the EU and by 16% in the US. The report from climate thinktank Ember, formerly Sandbag, warned that the dent in the world’s coal-fired electricity generation relied on many one-off factors, including milder winters across many countries. “Progress is being made on reducing coal generation, but nothing like with the urgency needed to limit climate change,” the report said. Dave Jones, the lead author of the report, said governments must dramatically accelerate the electricity transition so that global coal generation collapses throughout the 2020s. “To switch from coal into gas is just swapping one fossil fuel for another. The cheapest and quickest way to end coal generation is through a rapid rollout of wind and solar,” he said. “But without concerted policymaker efforts to boost wind and solar, we will fail to meet climate targets. China’s growth in coal, and to some extent gas, is alarming but the answers are all there.” The EU has made the fastest progress towards replacing coal with wind and solar power, while the US has increased its reliance on gas following its shale boom in recent years. The report revealed that renewable wind and solar power rose by 15% in 2019 to make up 8% of the world’s electricity. In the EU, wind and solar power made up almost a fifth of the electricity generated last year, ahead of the US which relied on these renewable sources for 11% of its electricity. In China and India, renewable energy made up 8% and 9% of the electricity system, respectively. To meet the Paris climate goals, the world needs to record a compound growth rate of 15% for wind and solar generation every year – which will require “a colossal effort”, the report warned. The electricity generation report was published as a separate piece of research claimed that 38 out of 75 of the world’s largest asset managers are stalling on taking action on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. The latest ranking by Asset Owners Disclosure Project, a scheme managed by the investment campaign group ShareAction, found that the 38 asset managers have weak or nonexistent policy commitments and fail to account for their real-world impacts across their mainstream assets. The survey also claimed that the investment managers often lack appropriate engagement and escalation processes on climate change, human rights and biodiversity. Scores were based on a survey of activities in responsible investment governance, climate change, human rights, and biodiversity and ranged between AAA to E. Not a single asset manager was granted an AAA or AA rating, the top two scores available. Felix Nagrawala, ShareAction analyst, said: “While many in the industry are eager to promote their ESG credentials, our analysis clearly indicates that few of the world’s largest asset managers can lay claim to having a truly sustainable approach across all their investments.” ShareAction said the world’s six largest asset managers – including BlackRock (rated D), State Street (D) and Vanguard (E) – were among the worst performers. Vanguard said it was committed to companies making “appropriate disclosures on governance, strategy and performance on relevant ESG risks”. BlackRock and State Street did not respond to a request for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/nov/01/after-30-years-of-cop-our-ex-environment-editor-is-now-optimistic","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-01T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"After 30 years of Cop, our ex-environment editor is now optimistic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/after-30-years-of-cop-our-ex-environment-editor-is-now-optimistic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/nov/01/after-30-years-of-cop-our-ex-environment-editor-is-now-optimistic","fields":{"headline":"After 30 years of Cop, our ex-environment editor is now optimistic","bodyText":"In September 2006, shortly before the annual UN climate talks to be held that year in Nairobi, Kenya, I looked for hope amid the predictions of ecological collapse and the total failure of countries to act on emissions. It was hard going. The best I could manage was to argue that political, social and technological awareness of the climate crisis was growing and starting to translate into action. It was now a race between new ideas and political realities. A personal revolution was taking place, I wrote. “See how far we have [all] come in a generation … Have you thought about installing solar panels or bought renewable energy? Have you chosen not to take a plane or bought a less powerful car? Have you voted for a political party or an individual because of their record on the environment? Have you tried to recycle more? Have you linked heatwaves and hurricanes with climate change, or wondered what kind of physical world your children will inhabit?” Yes, it was thin, but then it seemed unlikely that an oil-addicted, carbon-illiterate world could, or even wanted to, ditch fossil fuels. Hopelessness was rife. Net zero was on few agendas. Renewable wind and solar power barely registered, and disinformation by denier and free-market thinktanks had paralysed the debate. Even the most cautious predictions warned of climate change accelerating fast as populations and wealth grew, with more extreme and unpredictable weather, sea level rises, water and food shortages, and effects on biodiversity. I concluded: “Within most of our lifetimes there will be at least 2 billion more people – another China and a half – all being encouraged to consume as much oil, water, land, minerals, wood and stone as we in Britain do today. That will mean something like 1,000 times as many aeroplanes, 10 times as many cars and half as much food and water again being needed. Forget it. This will require several new planets.” Worryingly, few people seemed to understand the scale of the catastrophe-in-waiting. That year, the Royal Society in London declared there was scientific consensus of man-made warming, the 692-page Stern review showed how it could lead to the greatest recession in history, and the then UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, told world leaders that those who questioned climate change were “out of step, out of arguments and out of time”. But the media were barely interested enough to even send reporters to Nairobi, and it would be many years before the Murdoch empire, the BBC and even Channel 4 TV stopped giving equal air time to deniers. Even worse, despite climate being on the international agenda since 1992, the Kyoto protocol – the only binding global treaty that stipulated cuts in greenhouse gas emissions – had been in force for a year and then only obliged a handful of industrialised countries to cut emissions by 5.2% on 1990 figures. Meanwhile, the world’s two largest emitters – China and the US – were not even signed up. 2006 was possibly the lowest point in attempts to get the world to reduce emissions. More than 6,000 diplomats and NGOs went to Cop12 in Nairobi in 2006 and saw the US, Australia and other countries delay and undermine progress. A modest last-minute consensus was scrabbled together to take forward a five-year “plan of action” that allowed the EU, US and other governments to congratulate themselves. The British environment secretary, David Miliband, returned from Africa to tell parliament that “good progress” had been made. But to anyone outside the Cop bubble, progress had been negligible and ambition minimal. In truth, the talks were going at snail’s pace and a few rich countries that had helped create the climate crisis had once more chosen not to act decisively, nor provide the technology or the finance for others to help themselves. In the words of Greta Thunberg in 2021, the climate talks were just “blah, blah, blah”. And most of those gloomy predictions have already become real. Since 2006, world population has grown 20%, or by more than 1 billion people. By 2050, it is expected to reach 9.7 billion, a 50% rise in just one generation. There are 500m more vehicles now than there were then and air passenger numbers have more than doubled. Instead of 1.2 billion people being affected by water shortages in 2005, there are now more than 3 billion. In that short time, too, CO2 emissions have risen nearly 23%, and the last decade has been the warmest on record. Meanwhile, many millions of people have died in natural disasters, there have been catastrophic fires, droughts, floods and heatwaves, and nature is in clear decline. How Rio changed the world Climate talks have been strained to breaking point since 1972 when the UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm first put the issue on the international agenda. By 1992, when diplomats at the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro started negotiating a treaty to cut emissions, the enmity between rich and poor nations was running deep. Nearly one in two people in heavily indebted Africa, Asia and Latin America were living in extreme poverty, while consumerism in the rich world was rampant. The north wanted to talk about the global atmosphere and the felling of forests in Brazil and Indonesia, but the rest of the world demanded they first talk about development and poverty. There was deep resentment at the inequalities and those gaps between countries have never fully closed. By the time the then UK prime minister, John Major, arrived at the Riocentro convention halls in June 1992, weeks after being unexpectedly elected, any hope that cuts could be negotiated had been dashed. With the favelas in lockdown and military helicopters thundering up and down Copacabana and Ipanema beaches, US negotiators were under orders to water down previously-agreed positions to reduce greenhouse gases, and flatly refused to sign a treaty to protect biodiversity. It was the shape of things to come. The US – responsible for one quarter of the world’s emissions – had decided there should be no binding targets or timetables for cuts, that only a paltry $75m should be given to the world’s 4 billion poor to help them adapt, that action to cut emissions should be delayed for at least eight years and be voluntary. It got its way. Nevertheless, a weak climate convention was adopted and hailed by the rich world as a landmark agreement to save the planet. In truth it was almost meaningless and effectively ensured no action had to be taken for a decade. But in one respect Rio did change the world. As tens of thousands of local Cariocas joined western environmentalists, indigenous peoples, charities, women’s and faith groups, poverty campaigners and youth, there was a real sense of an impatient global grassroots climate movement emerging, demanding action and giving a voice to nature as never before. Two short speeches – one political, one emotional – captured the Rio mood. The Cuban president, Fidel Castro, expressed the anger felt by the south at the rich countries’ abuse of nature. “An important biological species – humankind – is at risk of disappearing due to the rapid and progressive elimination of its natural habitat. It must be said that consumer societies are chiefly responsible … They have poisoned the seas and the rivers. They have polluted the air. They have saturated the atmosphere with gases, altering climatic conditions with the catastrophic effects we are already beginning to suffer,” he said to thunderous applause at the opening session, before ending: “Enough of selfishness. Enough of schemes of domination. Enough of insensitivity, irresponsibility and deceit. Tomorrow will be too late to do what we should have done a long time ago.” The second speech came a few days later, from 1992’s equivalent of Greta Thunberg. The 12-year-old Severn Suzuki, daughter of one of Canada’s best-known environmentalists, shamed world leaders, saying: “I am only a child, yet I know if all the money spent on war was spent on finding environmental answers ending poverty and in finding treaties, what a wonderful place this Earth would be.” A third speech is possibly apocryphal, but has been quoted widely and has came to define the direction of future climate talks. A combative George HW Bush, leader of the world’s remaining superpower, flew to Rio on Air Force One for 24 hours and declared the US to be the world’s leading environmental nation, reportedly adding that “the American way of life is not up for negotiation. Period.” It was a reality check for optimists and from then on, the US was cast as the leading climate villain, a role it has played in most talks since. Unspectacular progress … until Paris In the 29 years since Rio, CO2 emissions have risen nearly 60% and are still rising, leaving some commentators to argue that the meetings are a circus, and because so few cuts have been made negotiations should be ditched in favour of radically different talks outside the UN process. The opposing argument is that blame for consistent failure should not be put on the complex, inclusive UN process, so much as the lack of political will from big emitters to act. Climate change is a global issue, so everyone must have a say and consensus via the UN is the last best hope to progress, it is said. Both arguments have merit. The talks have indeed been marked by mistrust and rancour but also by extraordinary initiatives and great gatherings of civil society. All meetings since 2001 have run overtime, many ending at dawn with last-ditch compromises, brinkmanship and dramatic rescues from abject failure. Angela Merkel, the then 38-year-old German environment minister who chaired the first Conference of the parties (Cop1) in Berlin in 1995, is said to have single-handedly pushed through proposals for what would become the Kyoto protocol, the cornerstone of all international action on global warming. Two years later, John Prescott, the British environment secretary, is credited with taking charge at Kyoto in Japan and banging heads together to secure an agreement to bind developed countries to cuts of about 5% by 2012. Disaster loomed on the final night of Cop17 in 2011 in Durban until, in a moment of genius, the South African presidency employed a traditional African mediation technique known as an indaba to bring together opposing people in small huddles. There have been villains, too. Bernarditas Muller, lead negotiator for China and the developing countries group, was widely disliked by western negotiators but admired by developing nations for her refusal to be bullied into watering down legal commitments. Al Gore, awarded the Nobel prize in 2007 for his work on climate, was the lead US negotiator in 1997 who demanded loopholes to allow rich countries to buy their cuts from poor countries, so evading the moral responsibility to act themselves. Saudi Arabia, Canada and Australia have all been accused regularly of trying to wreck, block or dilute commitments. But despite the dramas, most Cops since Berlin have only managed to grind out unspectacular progress. Cop6 in The Hague in 2001 failed to agree anything significant at all; Cop8 in Delhi may be remembered merely for agreeing to call for technology transfer; Cop11 in Canada just extended the life of the Kyoto protocol beyond 2012; Cop16 called for developing countries to be handed $100bn a year to adapt. The lowest point may have been in 2009 when Cop15 in Copenhagen descended into chaos and recrimination as rich countries were found negotiating secret deals. High points such as Cop21 in Paris in 2015, when a new treaty was signed binding all nations to make cuts, are very much the exception. The cause of a generation And yet. Despite the snail’s pace and the failures, I am far more optimistic now than in 1992 or 2006. In the early climate talks, the science was a side issue for many countries and negotiations were a political battleground, with groups of like-minded countries playing out ideological agendas to maintain influence or economic domination. For years, the US, EU and UK splashed foreign aid to keep former colonies onside and tried to prevent China from growing its economy. Equally, China could “buy” the support of countries with promises to invest in their economies. Now all governments have plans and self-interest today is redefined as rapid decarbonisation. In just 15 years, too, there has been a renewable power revolution, led by solar and wind. Green hydrogen is now roughly where solar was in 1992, and battery storage technologies and marine power are developing fast. With China no longer funding foreign coal plants and electric car sales taking off, the end of fossil fuels is nearly in sight. It will not be enough to hold temperatures to a rise of 1.5C-2C, but the revolution has started. There are other reasons to be optimistic. Every country has now had a taste of climate change. Social media, too, has sharpened the world spotlight and leaders will not want to return from Glasgow empty-handed or be branded as climate laggards or wreckers. Money issues, so long a stumbling block in the talks, may now be resolved, too. Since Covid, which has already cost countries trillions of dollars, the $100bn a year pledged but not provided by rich countries in 2009 to help vulnerable countries adapt does not look that much. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero alone has brought together hundreds of the world’s biggest banks and finance groups. To not find the money now would only make countries look cruel and self-destructive. Above all, that global hunger for action, which I first saw expressed in Rio 29 years ago, is now insatiable. The fight for the climate has become the cause of a generation, joined by worldwide movements of youth, indigenous peoples, faith and justice groups, businesses and local governments. Climate now embraces science, human rights, health, environmental justice, race, gender and equity. The arguments have been won, the science is certain, the solutions found, and people want progress. There’s still far to go, but the future is not set in stone as it appeared to be in 2006 – the old walls of doubt are crumbling, the momentum is building and there will be no going back from Glasgow.

Canapes of welsh rarebit made with Gower Gold ale, and umami-rich pots of cockles with cheese, bacon and an ingredient I was newly converted to – laverbread (not bread but seaweed). Then came fat asparagus from Manselfold Farm, a couple of miles from our Airbnb, and perhaps the peninsula’s best-known speciality, saltmarsh lamb baked overnight, with bone marrow gravy, roasties and no fewer than six fresh vegetables from Murton Farm, a few miles in the other direction. Dessert included gooey brownies laced with sloe gin from the Gower Gin Company. The conjuror of this feast of Welshness was Greek. Chef Christos Georgakis first cooked at his father’s taverna in Piraeus, but has been making the most of Gower ingredients since settling here 20 years ago, winning awards for best pub food – at the King Arthur in the village of Reynoldston – and reaching the semi-finals of MasterChef: The Professionals. During lockdown he offered takeaways and now works as a private chef (four courses from £50pp), which has proved a popular Covid-safe option with holidaymakers like us – no mingling in busy restaurants, no babysitter, no driving. The Gower peninsula has a long history of good food, thanks to fertile farmland, mild winters and miles of coast, and was self-sufficient until the 20th century, as road links were so poor. But we’d been drawn to this fist of land west of Swansea by a mini explosion of new foodie ventures combining traditional produce with prime 21st-century flavours: seasonal, organic, low-carbon… The arrival of Covid, at a time when several of them had barely got going, was a blow, but the mood among proprietors was buoyant as a domestic tourism boom and massive demand for truly local products looked set to keep everyone busy after lockdown regulations were lifted. In October 2019, Matt Heaven and George Cooke fulfilled a longing to translate the low-fuss east London bistro idea to south Wales when they opened restaurant Môr (it means sea) in what had been an unremarkable Chinese on Mumbles seafront. Despite prices higher than average for Swansea (three courses about £45), it was a hit, as people saw the value of what they were doing: making friends with fishers and farmers, shaping their menu around their best ingredients. They have several “lobster guys”, scallops come from the island of Lundy, and a local fishmonger alerts them when he’s “going bassing” off a Gower beach. The food may be high-end, but the vibe is informal – our friendly waitress was in cycle shorts and a Hawaiian shirt. A surprise success in Elwyn, the bar they added up the road in 2020, was an ox-tongue sandwich, suggested by their butcher. Its chewy, house-made crisps were fantastic too. Mumbles could be the new Padstow, said Matt and George, who raved about the Iraqi kebab shop a few doors away, with authentic Basra tabbouleh and hummus. This part of town is called Oystermouth, for its shellfish history, and oysters recently reseeded in the bay by Mumbles Oyster Company should come on stream in a couple of years (until then, Môr’s oysters come from the Menai Strait). The opening of a 16-room boutique hotel at Oyster Wharf later this year could seal the deal. We self-catered at the brand-new Snugl, a smart, secluded studio – you’d never know it was once a garage – in Reynoldston, handy for many foodie attractions. Wild ponies graze the moorland around here, and from Arthur’s Stone, a 15-minute walk away, views stretch south past Oxwich Bay to Lundy and north to the Burry estuary. South Gower’s beaches are stunning, but for food lovers the north shore, with its miles of marsh, is a big draw. We were too early to gather samphire at Whiteford Sands, with its cast-iron, wave-washed lighthouse, but enjoyed watching the tide-canny sheep browsing the rough ground. The home of Gower saltmarsh lamb, 14th-century Weobley Castle, is an attraction in its own right. Will Pritchard and family raise 1,500 lambs a year on marsh below the castle, the animals’ diet of sea lavender, sorrel and samphire giving the meat a unique flavour. The castle ruins remain officially closed but those visiting the shop can wander informally around its walls and keeps. In normal years it’s an atmospheric setting for folk and beer festivals – perhaps in 2022. The lamb sells out every year, with new-season meat available from July. High-quality lamb would once have been only for the rich, but a few miles east in Wernffrwd is a shrine to what ordinary folk ate – cockles and seaweed. Records show the Jones family firm, Selwyn’s Seafoods, first paid tax in 1950, but at the cafe and visitor centre they opened last smmer, Brian Jones told me his ancestors had gathered cockles from the estuary long before then. A photograph on the wall showed his mum, now nearly 90, who “has picked more cockles than anyone”, bent double with rake and riddle as a young woman. The molluscs – still small when we were there in chilly May – are traditionally eaten with vinegar and pepper, and also available at Gower chippies such as the Roma Fish Bar in Penclawdd. Selwyn’s also sells what Richard Burton called “Welshman’s caviar” – laverbread, made from Gower seaweed; but a slimy, dark green blob with your Welsh breakfast is challenging at first. It may have kept daylight-starved miners healthy, but I found it more acceptable the wimp’s way: on sourdough toast with cockles at the Plough &amp; Harrow pub in Murton. Selwyn’s now also has a machine from Japan to dry the algae into seaweed snacks – moreish, healthy tasting and sold in packets like crisps. What next, Gower sushi? Great food culture needs great agriculture, and a Gower tour can take in several inspiring farms. In the far south-west, the Wales Coast Path runs through Paviland Farm, where the Harry Thomas family’s dedication to “regenerative farming” also has benefits for visitors. Its switch away from intensive methods has seen the clifftops become more walkable, thanks to free-range Welsh Black cattle trampling the brambles and bracken and allowing wildflowers to reappear. GPS collars keep the beasts from getting too near to humans! Information boards explain how diversifying into organic fruit, veg, buckwheat, quinoa and pumpkins allows more integrated farming that offsets lower yields. Its oats, for example, go into locally made vegan ice-cream. Check @pavilandfarm for open days – the first is in September. One crop brought unexpected consequences last summer. Chris Harry Thomas planted sunflowers – for oil and bird food – on National Trust land near Rhossili. The flowers became a social media sensation, with people coming for miles to snap themselves among fields of gold. Gower Seafood Hut, from Mumbles seafront, set up an outpost here to feed the crowds, whose £4 parking fees put the whole southern department of Wales National Trust on a firm financial footing. The sunflowers will be in bloom again from mid-July. Liam Connick does similar work on smaller Killan Fach Eco farm, keeping pigs, sheep and hardy Black Rock hens, and producing solar power for sale to local households. Visitors are invited to walk a nature trail from its gate, with information boards and an honesty box selling duck, goose and hen eggs. His next plan is to add some glamping units. Just as impressive are self-taught young locals Billy and Tash of Bogan’s Bakery, who have been making sourdough loaves, croissants and pastries at their house in Loughor since December and sell out every day. Changing products each month – including a raspberry and almond swirl in summer – they deliver to holiday homes, campsites and bakeries (order on Facebook or WhatsApp). A good place to see several food champions in one place is Gower Heritage Centre, based at a 12th-century watermill restored to grind Killan Fach’s grain. We browsed its Saturday makers’ market for gooey brownies (made with Liam’s eggs and local butter) by Tir a Môr Bakes, goat’s cheese from recent arrivals Alun and Angela of Wobbly Bottom Cheeses and relishes from food historian Chendore Luan, who also offers bread, pickle and cheese-making classes, when permitted. More features are reopening each month, so check online. On our last day, we got in the mood for Christos’s feast at another relative newcomer. Gower Gin Company opened in pretty Port Eynon in 2017, and its converted bike shed claims to be the UK’s smallest micro-distillery. The weather being wet, we were glad of the glass-walled tasting room in owners Siân &amp; Andrew Brooks’s sea-view “gin garden”, where we spent a giddy hour trying six award-winning gins: my favourites were Dylan Thomas-themed Rhosili, with foraged sea buckthorn, gorse and linden flower, and a Christmassy Bara Brith variety. Book free tastings online. We raised the last glass with a “Iechyd da!” – wishing “good health” to all the passionate producers safeguarding Gower’s food future. More Gower food and drink favourites Look out in shops for Welsh Brew tea, from a Mumbles company that blends Assam and Kenyan Red varieties to make a perfect cuppa with soft Welsh water. Sally “Cupcake” Steadman opened her Gower home bakery in 2019 and will deliver scones with clotted cream, Welsh cakes or a bespoke birthday cake to holiday homes. Ask any local and they’ll say their favourite beer is Gower Gold, from Gower Brewery in Crofty, made with barley from Paviland Farm. The brewery also recently added GG Gelato, made with Paviland fruit and sold at an ice-cream parlour next to its Estuary Bar and Rooms in Penclawdd, opened in 2019. If you’re coming to Gower from the north, stock up on udder-fresh un-homogenised milk at Llaeth Beynon in Llanelli. When orders from coffee chains dried up in lockdown, the farm started selling its milk from a vending machine just off the M4, in reusable glass bottles. Going for a contactless milkshake from its machines became a lockdown sensation. Drivers needn’t miss out on Gower ale: Mumbles-based Drop Bear beers was started by two – again self-taught – twentysomething women in 2019, to bring “true craft” to the alcohol-free market, with a Yuzu Pale Ale, a tropical IPA, a stout and a lager. Buy it at Cheers in Mumbles or online. • Accommodation was provided by Snugl (on Airbnb, £80 a night, two-night minimum) • This article was amended on 5 July 2021.

Jasper Winn was appointed as the Canal and River Trust’s first “writer in motion”. He spent a year on towpaths and waterways, travelling by foot, bicycle and, of course, narrowboat. The “laws and lore” of canal life, he finds, are “based on the courtesy of a shared space”. As well as the tranquillity of slow travel on water, the sense of community impresses Winn: it’s “inclusive without being tribal, supportive without being regimented”. His book blends history with travelogue, bringing alive an alternative world where time is measured in “units of darting kingfishers”. Britain’s earliest canal dates from 1563, but they didn’t really catch on until the 18th century, when factories needed to bring large quantities of coal into the towns. When commercial canal transport collapsed in the postwar period, the unwanted narrowboats, butties (towed barges), flyboats (fast passenger vessels) and Dutch barges were bought up by houseboat dwellers. These days they are kitted out with solar power and on-board showers. But Winn sounds a note of caution on composting loos: they need “knowledge and attention through all the stages of fermentation worthy of that of a winemaker producing a grand cru”. • Water Ways: A Thousand Miles Along Britain’s Canals by Jasper Winn is published by Profile (£10.99).

In the UK we too have been able to look up at clearer blue skies, less impeded by air pollution and not crisscrossed by aircraft contrails. This helped Germany to break a solar power record. In Beijing, air pollution controls for the 2014 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting also brought a return to blue skies.

The 475-mile (765km) cable is a joint-venture between National Grid in the UK and Denmark’s Energinet. By 2023, the high-voltage, direct-current link will transmit the equivalent of enough electricity to power 1.5m British homes between Bicker Fen in Lincolnshire and the South Jutland region in Denmark. The €2bn Viking Link project will surpass the 450-mile North Sea link, which will begin importing Norwegian hydropower to the UK from 2021. Viking Link is one of several new super-cable projects, which are each considered a significant step towards the UK’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions because National Grid will be able to tap more renewable energy resources to replace fossil fuels. The UK has about 5GW of power cable capacity connecting Britain’s electricity system to power generated in the Netherlands, France and the Republic of Ireland. By the middle of the decade, this capacity is expected to rise fivefold to 25GW through a string of projects including more subsea cables to France and Ireland as well as new connections with Norway, Denmark, Germany and Belgium. A more ambitious project has been proposed to connect Britain to Iceland via a 620-mile subsea cable, but progress on these plans has been slow. Mike Elmer, National Grid’s project director, said the Viking Link cable would play a vital role in the UK’s net zero carbon ambitions by increasing Britain’s access to “a cleaner, greener supply of electricity, which will make energy more secure and affordable”. The project also means less homegrown renewable energy will go to waste on days where there is more wind and solar power than the UK can use, because National Grid would export the extra electricity via the cable rather than call for wind and solar farms to be turned off. Kwasi Kwarteng, the minister for energy and clean growth, said the project would “put Lincolnshire firmly at the heart of our economic recovery” and create jobs across the county. “It will also bolster our energy security, reduce bills for consumers, and give our homegrown renewable generators a greater chance to export zero-carbon electricity around the world,” the minister said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/nov/09/nsw-unveils-32bn-renewable-energy-plan-with-focus-on-pumped-hydro","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-08T23:02:01Z","webTitle":"NSW unveils $32bn renewable energy plan with focus on pumped hydro","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/09/nsw-unveils-32bn-renewable-energy-plan-with-focus-on-pumped-hydro","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/nov/09/nsw-unveils-32bn-renewable-energy-plan-with-focus-on-pumped-hydro","fields":{"headline":"NSW unveils $32bn renewable energy plan with focus on pumped hydro","bodyText":"The New South Wales government is promising a $32bn private investment boom in renewable energy in regional areas under a plan to transform the state’s electricity infrastructure. The state Coalition says an electricity infrastructure roadmap would support 12 gigawatts of renewable energy and 2 gigawatts of energy storage, with a focus on pumped hydro, over the next decade. Initial analysis of the plan, which is backed by the Labor party, suggests it could increase the share of renewable energy in the state from about 16% today to more than 60% by 2030. Government ministers said it would replace most of the state’s increasingly unreliable coal power plants, lower power prices, create more than 6,000 construction and 2,800 ongoing jobs and develop a new revenue stream for landholders hosting electricity infrastructure. They said the plan would “cut red tape” to speed up approvals for transmission infrastructure in renewable energy zones in the central west, New England and near Wagga Wagga, and create a long-term investment signal for new investment in renewable energy. The environment and energy minister, Matt Kean, described the renewable energy zones as being the modern equivalent of the ageing coal-power power stations that they will replace. At least four of the state’s five coal plants are expected to shut over the next 15 years, starting with the Liddell generator in early 2023. The government plans to attract investment in the zones by holding reverse auctions to award 20-year contracts that will give energy companies a guaranteed minimum floor price for the electricity they generate. The auctions will be run by a new office known as the consumer trustee. Kean said the roadmap would position NSW as an energy superpower. “Our priority is to keep the lights on and get power prices down, with the roadmap forecast to save NSW households an average of $130 and small businesses an average of $430 on their electricity bills each year,” he said. The deputy premier and Nationals leader, John Barilaro, said the plan would make sure renewable projects were built “where local communities want them” in ways that are compatible with farming. He suggested landowners could earn $1.5bn in lease payments by 2042. The commitment also includes $50m in grants for pumped hydro projects. The state push contrasts with the Morrison government’s emphasis on a gas-led recovery from the Covid-19 crisis and refusal to introduce an overarching policy to encourage private investment in renewable energy after the national renewable energy target was filled last year. The federal Coalition is instead promising to underwrite new investments in pumped hydro, gas and, in one case, coal to provide the “firm” generation needed to support the rapid increase in variable wind and solar power. It has also set “stretch goals” to lower the cost of some “clean” technologies as part of its technology investment roadmap. These goals are not tied to a timeframe or emissions reduction trajectory. Farmers welcome energy plan Conservationists and farming groups welcomed the NSW announcement. Charlie Prell, a sheep farmer and the chair of Farmers for Climate Action, said it would create a more resilient and prosperous agriculture sector. He said large-scale renewables could help drought-proof farmers “by providing a reliable, off-farm income stream, while also reducing emissions”. “Hosting wind turbines on my own farm has given me and my family a lifeline as we battle the droughts and floods that are being exacerbated by climate change,” he said. The Australian Conservation Foundation said it was great to see bipartisan support for an energy transition plan. “The federal government could learn from this roadmap – the future is in clean energy, not dirty, polluting fuels like gas,” Gavan McFadzean, the foundation’s climate change program manager, said. The Morrison government has resisted the global push to cut emissions to net zero by 2050, which has gained pace with the election of US president-elect Joe Biden. It has a 2030 emissions target of a 26%-28% cut below 2005 levels, having rejected a science-based recommendation by the Climate Change Authority of a reduction of between 45% and 60% over that timeframe. Prior to Covid-19, national emissions had reduced just 2.2% since the Coalition was elected in 2013 and official data released last December suggested Australia would miss its 2030 target unless it used a contentious carbon accounting measure rejected by other countries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/may/29/hollywood-and-homelessness-the-two-sides-of-byron-bay","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-28T20:00:05Z","webTitle":"Hollywood and homelessness: the two sides of Byron Bay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/29/hollywood-and-homelessness-the-two-sides-of-byron-bay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/may/29/hollywood-and-homelessness-the-two-sides-of-byron-bay","fields":{"headline":"Hollywood and homelessness: the two sides of Byron Bay","bodyText":"In Byron Bay, a coastal town at the easternmost point of mainland Australia, there are rainbow lorikeets everywhere. They fly between postcard palm trees: small blurs of yellow, red, orange, blue and green against a backdrop of cloudless skies. It is almost too much – the colourful birds, the warm weather, the rolling hills, and of course, the Hollywood stars. Chris Hemsworth, Zac Efron and Matt Damon own property close to the town. Byron’s social media influencers – the murfers or “mum surfers”, in particular – are world famous, thanks to a profile in Vanity Fair. So potent are its charms that 2.2 million tourists visit Byron shire each year. But the region this year earned a more sinister distinction: outside Sydney, the shire now has the highest rate of homelessness in Australia’s most populous state of New South Wales. The problem is particularly and newly acute for women. During the past 18 months, the town and nearby villages that form part of Byron shire have seen an unprecedented rise in housing inequality. Between June and December last year, the average apartment rental price went up by 33%, while the house rental price increased by 66%. Over the course of the year, house prices rose 37%, as people left cities to work remotely. In May, a “slightly intoxicated and barely dressed” real estate agent sold, over the phone, a house that even he hadn’t yet seen – for $12.5m. Moving, packing, unpacking, cleaning, worrying A short walk from Byron’s main beach is Byron Community Centre, its muralled walls and scruffy latticework at odds with the surrounding boutiques selling white linen and earthy homewares. Ianna Murray is the centre’s homelessness caseworker. When we meet early on a drizzly Wednesday morning, she is making coffee and handing out sandwiches as part of the centre’s homeless breakfast. Byron Bay has no homelessness support services beyond the centre. There is no emergency accommodation or Centrelink (Australia’s social security programme) office and there is infrequent public transport to nearby towns. Since 2018, the number of people sleeping on the streets has increased 37%. So has the number of luxury cars, says Murray. She recently spotted a lime green Rolls Royce. “The big joke about Byron now,” says Murray, is “Who’s going to clean your mansions?” Louise O’Connell, the centre’s managing director, says women have been particularly hard hit. Women tend to earn less than men and have lower savings and retirement incomes. In Australia, 37% of single-parent households headed by women are living in poverty – twice the number of those headed by men. Police estimate that 400 women are sleeping in tents and cars, says O’Connell, but the number is likely higher: women are hesitant to identify themselves as homeless because they worry their children will be taken away. Most of those who do ask for help have never needed it before. Cassandra Sheppard, 47, is among them. Sheppard moved to Byron five years ago for a relationship. When it broke down, she moved out – but a few months later her landlord upped the rent by $200 a week. Though Sheppard works full-time for a local social enterprise, she couldn’t afford the increase. She struggled to find an alternative. Soon, she was sleeping in a van, then a caravan, a friend’s spare room, and another’s granny flat. “I moved six times in one year,” she says. “I just spent my entire waking life moving, packing, unpacking, cleaning, worrying, house-hunting.” She found an apartment that, soon after she moved in, was sold; her landlord in the subsequent apartment hiked the rent by more than the raise Sheppard had recently been given. Sheppard and her daughter are now securely housed, but her current rent swallows two-thirds of her income. She would leave, but Byron and the school and families her daughter has grown up with are vital points of stability in what has otherwise been an uncertain time. “My daughter started her school years here. This is her place and her people,” she says. A housing market ‘gone ballistic’ “This is absolutely the worst crisis I have seen in Byron,” says Michael Lyon, acting mayor of Byron shire. The threshold for rental stress is spending more than 30% of your income on rent. “The average in Byron is 50%,” says Lyon. Some locals blame Hollywood stars and local influencers for driving up prices. When Netflix announced recently that Byron would be the backdrop for a new reality TV show, Byron Baes, “a docusoap series following a ‘feed’ of hot Instagrammers”, there was fierce backlash from residents. But Lyon doesn’t believe influencers and celebrities have had much of an impact on housing. The chief causes of the crisis, he says, are Airbnb, people fleeing cities to work remotely during the pandemic, and federal government policies that incentivise the purchase of second homes. In 2020, regional property prices across Australia rose by four times the rate Australia’s capital cities did, according to property analytics firm CoreLogic. The council is drawing up a proposal to limit Airbnb rentals to 90 days a year, which in theory will make long-term renting more attractive to owners. Insideairbnb.com tracks the number of listings in major tourist cities and towns around the world. Of the 15,000 dwellings in Byron shire, more than 3,500 are listed on Airbnb. On average, these are occupied for just 19% of the year, or 73 nights. The recent and frequently booked listings are occupied for 163 nights a year. Over the summer, council undertook its regular crackdown on “van packers”, or tourists illegally camping in vans. This year, says Lyons, council workers knocked on windows to discover they were occupied by people they knew. There were women who couldn’t afford to stay, but had custody agreements that meant they weren’t allowed to leave. Celebrities may not be the root of the problem, but the past year has seen a marked influx of wealth, says Byron shire real estate agent Alli Page, who has been working in the town of Bangalow for 18 years. Since the start of the pandemic, sales have “gone ballistic”, she says, more so than at any other time in her career. “Very, very wealthy people don’t mind whether a house costs $6m or $12m.” Just 18 months ago the average house price was $850,000, says Page. Now it is $1.3m. In May, Sydney hospitality billionaire Justin Hemmes bought a Byron pub formerly known as Cheeky Monkey’s – his first purchase in regional NSW – for $13m. Thirty years of neglect While the crisis is at a new peak, it has been building for decades. North Coast Community Housing provides social and affordable housing for people on low, very low and moderate incomes. Typically, tenants are charged 25% of their income as rent, and rest is subsidised by the state government. Currently, the waitlist is 3,200 applicants – or five to 10 years’ long. The not-for-profit’s CEO, John McKenna, says Byron’s private housing market is “broken”. A healthy level of rental vacancies for any given area is between 2.5 and 4%. This leaves wriggle room in the supply so that landlords don’t hold all of the power. Byron’s vacancy rate is 0.3%. The crisis, he says, “has been caused by 30 years of neglect by successive governments”. To fix it, he believes the government needs to build at least 250 social and affordable homes a year for the next decade. The local council has proposed a short-term solution to the crisis: building tiny houses – highly Instagrammable 25 sq m homes – for locals to live in. “The whole living space is not much bigger than a master bedroom,” he says. “If you and I decided to live there, fine. But when people are forced to live there, I have a problem with that.” Local developer Brandon Saul is trying to address the lack of long-term residential housing through one- and two-bedroom “pocket” apartments (his company, Habitat, also sponsors the Byron Community Centre). The smallest is 45 sq m and he has built 60 so far. They’re run entirely on solar power, come with free use of an electric car, van and bike – and holiday letting is strictly forbidden. According to Saul, all 60 sold within two weeks of going on the market in December last year – the cheapest for $495,000. A two-bedroom apartment originally bought for $650,000 resold – five months later – for $1.3m. The apartments are built on the edge of a two-storey complex of shops, cafes and office space. As Saul showed me around, we looked into one: it was packed, the only very busy place late on a Thursday afternoon. “Airbnb rental managers,” Saul says. Having no secure housing is exhausting, says Sama Balson, who founded activist group and support network Women’s Village Collective in 2020 in response to the housing crisis. If you’re living in your car, it takes a lot of time each day to work out where to bathe, how to eat, where to go to the bathroom, where to park so that you won’t be harassed or told to leave, she says. “You’re in survival mode.” In the Byron Bay beach parking lot one evening, a man chops onions in a van with its trunk open to the waves, children’s wetsuits drying in the disappearing sun. On the roof of another van, buskers play a guitar and sing. And in a car nearby, a middle-aged woman is fast asleep, her windows open to let the breeze through."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2020/jul/20/laura-corrigan-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-20T17:26:49Z","webTitle":"Laura Corrigan obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2020/jul/20/laura-corrigan-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2020/jul/20/laura-corrigan-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Laura Corrigan obituary","bodyText":"My daughter, Laura Corrigan, who has died of colon cancer at the age of 37, was a marine ecologist and eco-warrior. From an early age she was passionate about the sea and single-minded in her desire to have a career in marine ecology. She gained a first-class degree at the University of Essex in 2003 and returned to her home city to complete a PhD at Durham University on the population genetics of the Arctic char (a type of fish). In 2013, after several postdoctoral fellowships at Durham University, Laura started working for the Environment Agency (EA) with responsibility for the restoration, protection and enhancement of priority coastal habitats along the north-east and Yorkshire coasts, including Holy Island, Budle Bay, and the Coquet and Esk estuaries. While at the EA she was twice given awards for innovation. She championed the profiling of environmental DNA, a less invasive method of mapping marine populations, and the methods she introduced have had a lasting impact on the EA’s approach to marine work. Her final project was the restoration of the salt marshes in the Wear estuary following the building of the new road bridge at Sunderland. Laura was born and brought up in Durham, the third of four children of Edward Corrigan, professor of mathematics at the University of York, and me, Jane (nee Halton), a retired community adult education coordinator. She went to Durham Johnston comprehensive school. A keen kayaker and wild swimmer, Laura was never happier than when exploring her beloved north-east coast. Even when seriously ill she completed the one-mile Loch Lomond swim to raise money for Bowel Cancer UK. As a single parent of two boys, she became an enthusiastic proponent of natural parenting, as well as a breastfeeding supporter and a founder member of the County Durham cloth nappy library. In 2012 she created Rainbow Threads, an online tie-dye business that produced T-shirts, linens and children’s clothes, and for many years she was a member of Fusion, a belly-dance group, performing at weddings and parties. Protective of the environment, she encouraged family and friends to use solar power, to recycle, to save water and to take better care of our fragile planet. For more than three years, Laura bore her long and painful illness with stoicism, courage and optimism. She is survived by her sons, Max, aged nine, and Finn, aged four, her sister, Anna, her brothers, David and Richard, and by her father and me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2020/may/03/the-observer-view-on-britains-relationship-with-saudi-arabia-","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-03T05:00:43Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Britain's relationship with Saudi Arabia | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/03/the-observer-view-on-britains-relationship-with-saudi-arabia-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2020/may/03/the-observer-view-on-britains-relationship-with-saudi-arabia-","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on Britain's relationship with Saudi Arabia","bodyText":"Dramatic falls in global oil prices are the result, primarily, of collapsing demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. Other factors predating the crisis are also at work: this year’s price-cutting war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, overproduction resulting in crude oil surpluses and a chronic lack of storage capacity. Yet conventional market explanations obscure a bigger, more exciting story. It is the story of the green, clean energy revolution, of rapidly expanding use of wind and solar power and the prospective end of the fossil fuel era. Renewables will make up almost 30% of world demand for electricity this year. Last week, Britain set a record by going 18 consecutive days without resorting to coal-fired power generation, according to National Grid data. The UK also hit a new solar power high on 20 April. Since 2012, the amount of emissions required to produce one kilowatt hour of energy has declined by more than two-thirds. These advances towards a net-zero carbon future are artificially accelerated by the Covid-19 lockdown. They could be reversed. Yet sustainable energy generation, and its crucial importance in tackling the climate crisis, is one of many areas where today’s enforced changes could lead to fundamental, permanent shifts in the “post-oil” future. Britain’s dysfunctional and often embarrassing relationship with Saudi Arabia, one of the world’s leading oil producers, should form part of any such post-pandemic reappraisal. British dependence on Saudi crude increased after Iran’s 1979 revolution. North Sea discoveries changed that. Most imported UK oil now comes from Norway. Only 3% comes from Saudi Arabia. Successive governments have nevertheless continued to nurture the Saudi relationship. A main reason is Riyadh’s apparently insatiable appetite for weaponry. According to analysis by the Campaign Against Arms Trade, BAE Systems sold £15bn worth of arms and services to Saudi Arabia between 2015 to 2019. Thousands of British jobs are said to be contingent on such sales. Much of this weaponry has been used in the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, which entered its sixth murderous year in March. The UN says the war has helped cause the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. In June last year, to the government’s disgust, the court of appeal halted UK arms sales, citing concerns about a “historic pattern of breaches of international humanitarian law”. If oil and arms are taken out of the equation, what remains to bind Britain to an undemocratic, quasi-feudal regime notorious for its human rights abuses, repression of its Shia Muslim minority, institutionalised discrimination against women and dangerous efforts to draw Britain and the US into confrontation with its arch rival, Iran? One often-heard justification for turning a blind eye is that the Saudis offer invaluable intelligence in the fight against fanatical Islamist groups such as Islamic State and al-Qaida. It is certainly in Britain’s interest that the Saudis continue to cooperate with western counter-terrorism efforts. But it’s a two-way street. The Saudi regime lacks legitimacy. It faces a region-wide challenge from Iran and threats of its own from Sunni extremists. It appears unable, despite superficial reforms, to satisfy a youthful population’s aspirations for a more open society. Terrorism, feeding off instability and injustice, is a big problem for Riyadh, too. High levels of Saudi investment in British businesses and property are also given as an excuse for maintaining the status quo. But if nothing else does, the brutal 2018 murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, allegedly on the orders of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, should shatter such complacency. Right now, for example, the Premier League should heed Khashoggi’s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, and block the proposed purchase of Newcastle United by a Saudi fund controlled by Salman. And once the Covid crisis is past, the government should launch a full-spectrum review of bilateral relations. Collapsing demand for their key export means the Saudis are not the power they were.

What happened at Cop27: day seven ‘This could be the Cop where we lose 1.5C,’ warns Alok Sharma, as anxiety grows over a push from some countries to weaken the text. Brazil would love to host Cop in 2025, according to Marina Silva, the country’s former environment minister and a close ally of its incoming president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is widely expected to be given a ministerial post when he forms his new government. Indigenous women from the Amazon held a press conference calling out the violence committed against their land and their bodies. UN climate boss Simon Stiell urged countries to use their remaining time in Egypt to “build the bridge needed” to make progress on 1.5C, adaptation, finance, and loss and damage. Cop president Shoukry seemed confident that the talks would wrap up on time by Friday, but those on the ground think that is highly unlikely and negotiations are going badly. Developing countries criticised the G7’s loss and damage strategy. My colleague Nina Lakhani reported that the G7 countries – historically the most responsible for the global greenhouse gases causing extreme weather events and slow-onset climate disasters and who have for years delayed and denied the need for a loss and damage fund – are pushing the Global Shield insurance scheme as an alternative. Three tropical rainforest nations – Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo – have signed a strategic alliance to coordinate at their conservation summit at G20. The family of the Egyptian-British hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah have received proof of life – a hand-written letter from prison. My colleague Oliver Holmes will be blogging bright and early tomorrow. The theme for the day will be energy, and we’ll be following all the developments, as always. Thanks for joining us. Alok Sharma, the former UK cabinet minister who presided over the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last year, made a spirited defence of the Glasgow climate pact at the opening of the high-level ministerial roundtable discussions on pre-2030 ambition at Cop27, and warned delegates of the binary choice facing them: “We’ll either leave Egypt having kept 1.5C alive or this will be the Cop where we lose 1.5C.” He said sticking to the global goal of limiting temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels had to be a “red line” for all countries at Cop27, and insisted there could be no “backsliding” from it. He reminded the gathered ministers of what was achieved last year, in very different geopolitical circumstances from the current conference of the parties. “At Cop26 we did resolve collectively to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C,” he said. “I have always said what we agreed in Glasgow and Paris has to be the baseline of our ambition. We’ve got to stick to that commitment. We cannot allow any backsliding.” But he warned: “We are already at 1.1C global warming, and I know I don’t have to remind all of you the impact of that around the world. Even at 1.5C we are still going to have devastating outcomes for many millions. As our friend from Bangladesh reminded us, 1.5 needs to be a red line. And this cannot be the Cop where we lose 1.5C.” He added: “We’ve got to fight for this and every fraction of a degree absolutely makes a difference. It’s the difference … between a tolerable existence and an impossible future.” He said countries needed to set out clearly how they would cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with the 1.5C target. “We’ve got a G20 leaders’ meeting going on right now,” he said, referring to the meeting of G20 world leaders in Bali now under way. “They need to reaffirm their commitment to Paris and to Glasgow.” He called on countries that had not yet submitted revised national plans on emissions – called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – to draw them up urgently. He also called for a faster phasing out of coal and of fossil fuel subsidies. And he called for technical issues in the Cop work programme to be resolved. He added that keeping 1.5C alive was fundamental to the other key issues of Cop27, including climate finance and the struggles over loss and damage. “The reality is without progress on [cutting emissions] we are going to beyond our ability to adapt and of course I want to see progress made on loss and damage here but unless we stick to [1.5C] all of that is going to be a lot more difficult.” He concluded starkly: “We’ll either leave Egypt having kept 1.5C alive or this will be the Cop where we lose 1.5C. You need to work out how you want future generations to look upon this Cop and each of us individually as countries. It’s really up to us to decide, I hope we will decide to keep 1.5C alive.” The warning comes amid anxiety that some countries may be trying to get the wording around 1.5C weakened. Earlier today, Dr Simon Evans of Carbon Brief tweeted that “some parties are pushing for a return to Paris language, which centres on ‘well-below 2C.’” Denmark and Sweden head the field, China has slumped and Australia has risen slightly but remains near the bottom in a new ranking list of climate performance by civil society groups released at Cop27. The annual climate change performance index, now in its 18th year, assesses 59 countries and the EU on four measures: emissions, renewable energy, energy use and climate policy. Compiled by Germanwatch, the NewClimate Institute and Can International, it found no country was yet on a 1.5C pathway. The top three spots on the table were left blank, reflecting that no one was performing at the level expected to justify such a high ranking. The leader, Denmark, was ranked fourth, followed by Sweden, Chile, Morocco and India. The UK was 11th. The world’s biggest polluter, China, fell dramatically compared with last year’s rankings, dropping from 38 to 51. The authors found while China was backing renewable energy at substantial levels, it was also continuing to invest in new coal plants and failing to curb rising emissions. It ranked one spot higher than the US, which climbed three spots to 52 following the passage of an extraordinary $369bn in climate measures included in the Inflation Reduction Act, but was held back by its high per capita emissions and renewable energy share. The other notable mover was Australia. It jumped four spots from 59 to 55 following the introduction of the Albanese Labor government, which has legislated a new national emissions reduction target for 2030 (a 43% cut compared with 2005 levels) and started work on policies to cut industrial emissions and encourage electric vehicle uptake. The authors said these changes were welcome, but modest, and the target still too weak. The bottom 10 on the list was dominated by fossil fuel producers: Poland, Australia, Malaysia, Chinese Taipei, Canada, Russia, Korea, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia and, in last place, Iran. Jan Burck of Germanwatch urged countries to use the external shock of the energy crisis to accelerate the expansion of renewables and energy efficiency, and end fossil fuel dependence. “It’s a moment of truth: how serious are countries about their climate commitments? Today, it becomes evident that the fossil fuel system is still very strong and present.” Brazil would welcome the opportunity to host the UN climate summit in 2025 if the international community can forgive the havoc caused by the previous Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who backtracked on a commitment to hold Cop25 in 2019, according to Marina Silva, the former environment minister and close ally of incoming president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. “It’s terrible what Bolsonaro did, we lost an opportunity in 2019 and we have a dream to honour that commitment,” Silva told the Guardian. Deforestation of the Amazon, the world’s largest rainforest, dropped during Silva’s tenure as Lula’s environment minister, but has risen over the past four years under Bolsonaro, who has encouraged illegal loggers, miners and farmers while dismantling law enforcement and other government agencies tasked with protecting the region and its people. Violence against Indigenous people and other environmental defenders also escalated, including the murder of Guardian journalist Dom Phillips and Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira in June. “It hurts me that environmental defenders like Dom and Bruno had to sacrifice their lives, but we must honour their lives, not just their deaths. We must take the criminals out of this land and ensure the state is present to enforce the law, as well as create alternative sustainable economies that leave the forest intact. No more people should die for this cause, we have to end this cycle of murders,” said Silva. A major challenge will be ensuring a just transition away from deforestation for all the people of the Amazon – including the illegal loggers, miners and small-scale farmers. “We can facilitate new sustainable economic activities that leave the forest intact, like ecotourism and sustainable fishing, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, as well as creating new value chains for the Amazon’s foods and products.” Silva, who is expected to get a ministerial post in Lula’s government, repeated the president-elect’s commitment to zero deforestation, but emphasised that this would not be enough to mitigate against the worst effects of global greenhouse gas emissions. “Brazil has always contributed more to climate mitigation than any country, and we want to do more through modern solutions integrated with traditional Indigenous knowledge. But the world needs to do its part to reduce CO2 emissions, because if not, even if we stop deforestation, the Amazon will disappear if the temperature rises.” Bolsonaro did not attend Cop27, but Lula will give a highly anticipated speech on Wednesday. Reaction is still coming in to the announcement, earlier today, that the US and China will restart talks on the climate crisis. The talks had been on hold as part of the general seizing up of relationships between the countries. But the US president, Joe Biden, met with Xi Jinping, the president of China, for several hours today before the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, and agreed to get back around the table. Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute, said: “The global community is breathing a sigh of relief that President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are restarting joint efforts to tackle climate change. There is simply no time left for geopolitical fault lines to tear the US and China away from the climate negotiation table. “Of course, coming back to the table is just a precursor for the leadership on climate change that is required from these two super economies. We need exponential progress that can only happen if the world’s top two emitters commit to work together to combat climate change and support decarbonization efforts worldwide. “We urge the US and China to use the G20 Summit and the UN climate summit in Egypt as platforms to reconfirm their steadfast support for the Glasgow climate pact, including limiting global warming to 1.5C, jointly committing to bolder action to rein in methane emissions, and working to address increasingly severe impacts from climate change.” In the UK, Just Stop Oil activists have just tweeted out a film of themselves throwing orange paint at a building that they identify as the Silver Fin building in Aberdeen, where Barclays and Shell have offices. Scientist and author Dr Michael E Mann, one of the earliest to sound the alarm on the climate crisis, published the results of two surveys today with Shawn Patterson Jr looking at “public disapproval of disruptive climate change protests”. Run by the Annenberg Public Policy Center (APPC), it set out to investigate the impact these actions have on public perceptions of climate breakdown. The surveys, which were conducted with just over 2,000 respondents, found that 46% of them reported that these tactics decreased their support for efforts to address climate breakdown; 40% of respondents said the tactics had no effect; and 13% said the tactics increased their support. Indigenous women from the Amazon have just held a press conference calling out the violence committed against their land and their bodies, as well as the failure of the Cop summit to take their ideas and solutions seriously. “In both cases we are talking about consent and violations of our right to decide,” said Helena Gualinga (Kichwa), an Indigenous youth climate leader from Sarayaku, Ecuador. “We are the main custodians of the untouched forests. If women are protected, we will also protect the territories and ecosystems essential to climate mitigation.” Also from Ecuador, Patricia Gualinga (Kichwa), from the Amazon Women in Defense of the Jungle, warned investors in and extractive industries to stay away. “It will be bad for business. If you come in, we will stop you because we are in a struggle for our lives ... but we come here with ideas and proposals that can contribute to global solutions, you just have to listen and respect the knowledge and include us in the decision making, otherwise this summit will fail.” Today is water and gender day at Cop27, and women across the world are on the frontline protecting water (and land) from exploitation by extractive industries like monocropping, mines and oil, which guzzle scarce supplies and contaminate groundwater sources. But thinking about water and land protection separately – as government policies and NGO initiatives often do – can create imbalances in complex interdependent ecosystems, said Sônia Bone Guajajara, Indigenous leader from Brazil who was recently elected to the National Congress. “We are the ones protecting biodiversity, so we need Indigenous women in decision making spaces yet here at Cop our participation is still undermined.” The press conference ended with a rallying cry: “Not one more drop of Indigenous blood. The Amazon is not for sale.” Megan Darby, the editor of Climate Home, is also getting a little edgy. She says she has now covered seven Cops and is getting better, she hopes, at filtering out the noise and … “there’s precious little signal out there today”. She points out that “normally technical negotiators hand over to ministers at the weekend to thrash out political issues in the second week. The #Cop27 presidency doesn’t plan to bring ministers into negotiations until Wednesday”. Expectations for this Cop were low, to be fair. Darby wonders if, as a result, “we could end up with a short cover text that just recalls the Glasgow pact etc”. This week, negotiators are trying to hammer out the draft text to be agreed by the end of the week. The Paris Agreement in 2015 secured agreement that countries would hold the global temperature average to “well below 2C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above preindustrial levels”. Cop26 in Glasgow last year put a much stronger emphasis on 1.5C. But Dr Simon Evans of Carbon Brief has just flagged that a number of large economies are now pushing for “a return to Paris language, which centres on ‘well below 2C’.” This kind of push and pull is the stuff that negotiations are made of. But still, it would be deflating, given the state of the climate emergency, to see anything that looked like going backwards. Good afternoon, I’m taking over from my colleague Helena Horton for the rest of the day, bringing you developments in Sharm el-Sheikh as they come. In the meantime, may I recommend this report by Arthur Neslen, who has taken a deep dive into the world of the Energy Charter Treaty. Germany became the latest country, at the end of last week, to announce its intention to exit the ECT, the arbitration system which allows energy companies to sue governments. Germany is following in the footsteps of France, Spain and the Netherlands, although the UK is still holding out. This puts the EU in an awkward position as it discusses how to reform the treaty. Neslen carried out analysis with Transnational Institute and Powershift, and found issues with perceived conflicts of interest and concerns over self-regulation. So I am signing off the blog shortly and handing over to my colleague Bibi van der Zee, who will keep you thoroughly entertained and informed throughout the afternoon. Here is what has happened so far today. As the second week kicked off, the UN climate boss Simon Stiell urged countries to use their remaining time in Egypt to “build the bridge needed” to make progress on 1.5C, adaptation, finance, and loss and damage. The Cop president, Sameh Shoukry, seemed confident that the talks would wrap up on time by Friday, but those on the ground think that is highly unlikely and negotiations are going very badly. Back in the UK,a former adviser to No 10, who worked under Boris Johnson and left in May this year, has started a campaign to get green growth on the agenda. Sam Richards, who today launches his new campaign, Britain Remade, says “special interests” have blocked green growth initiatives such as onshore wind and he plans to change that. We launched our best dressed competition as so many people are wearing beautiful clothes from their home countries at Cop. Keep sending them in to Bibi! Developing countries criticised the G7’s loss and damage strategy. My colleague Nina Lakhani reported that the G7 countries – historically the most responsible for the global greenhouse gases causing extreme weather events and slow-onset climate disasters and who have for years delayed and denied the need for a loss and damage fund – are pushing the Global Shield insurance scheme as an alternative. This has not gone down well with climate justice advocates or developing countries, some of which would be excluded for being too developed. My colleague Patrick Greenfield brought in a fantastic scoop that the big three tropical rainforest nations – Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo – have signed a strategic alliance to coordinate at their conservation summit at G20. The family of Egyptian British hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah say they have received proof of life: a handwritten letter from prison. We’ve had a guest post from the international climate and nature minister Lord Goldsmith, and I don’t want to promise something we can’t deliver, but we should be getting one from a mystery A-lister later … As ever, there is much more to come both today and for the remainder of the conference so stay tuned and thank you for reading the Guardian. We will be blogging every day so check the site – and I’ll be back with you later this week. UK trade minister makes speech at institute which has played down global heating My eagle-eyed colleague Peter Walker has pointed out that Kemi Badenoch has chosen Cop27 week as an opportunity to speak at the Cato Institute, a thinktank which has been accused of disputing the science around climate change. At her first speech as international trade minister, she chose to address this group in Washington as she promotes US-UK trade. Greenpeace has a good summary of the institute’s contributions to climate dialogue. It’s full of interesting nuggets such as: “The organisation’s 2009 ‘Handbook for Policymakers’ on global warming begins with the suggestions that Congress should ‘pass no legislation restricting emissions of carbon dioxide’ and ‘inform the public about how little climate change would be prevented by proposed legislation’.’” On its website, the institute says: “Global warming is indeed real, and human activity has been a contributor since 1975. But global warming is also a very complicated and difficult issue that can provoke very unwise policy in response to political pressure.” Regular Guardian readers may remember this isn’t her first controversy when it comes to net zero – when she stood for Conservative leader and prime minister she did a spectacular double U-turn on net zero after calling it “unilateral economic disarmament”. The family of the Egyptian British hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah have received proof that he is still alive, a letter from prison written on Saturday and given to his mother today. Abd el-Fattah has been on a prolonged hunger strike since April which he escalated to cease drinking water on the day Cop27 began. He told his mother, the activist Laila Soueif, that he began drinking water again on Saturday, six days into his water strike, in a very carefully worded letter. Here’s a translation: 4pm Saturday 12/11/2022 How are you, Mama? I’m sure you’re really worried about me. This will be a short letter and the long letter will be the day of the provisions. From today I’m drinking water again so you can stop worrying until you see me yourself. Vital signs today are OK. I’m measuring regularly and receiving medical attention. When you come with the provisions bring the MP3 player with you and god willing it will be allowed in. I will need vitamins because what I have is almost finished, and effervescent salts. I miss you all and love you all very much Alaa The Egyptian public prosecutor and authorities have said that Abd el-Fattah received a “medical intervention”, last week, amid cryptic statements from President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that he was “committed” to preserving the democracy activist’s health. Abd el-Fattah’s family have raised concerns that efforts to keep him alive but shielded from public view could change after Cop27 ends, amid rising pressure on the British government to get access to a detained British national. Abd el-Fattah’s lawyer, Khaled Ali, is currently at Wadi Al Natrun prison where he is being held for a second consecutive day in a bid to get access to his client. Thanks to Guardian reader Nyshie Perkinson who has sent in a submission for best dressed. This is Djyba Gomes Jao, from Guinea Bissau And our Nina Lakhani, who is on a fashion photography spree today, has sent in another submission. This is the magnificently dressed Ninawa Inu Pereria Nunes Huni Kui from the Indigenous Educational Network of Turtle Island. The big three tropical rainforest nations – Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo – have signed a strategic alliance to coordinate at their conservation at G20, the Guardian can reveal. The agreement, signed by the administration of outgoing president Jair Bolsonaro, who has overseen enormous deforestation of the Amazon, says the three countries will coordinate on UN climate and biodiversity talks related to tropical forests, with a focus on finance, sustainable management and restoration. Brazil, Indonesia and DRC are home to 52% of the world’s remaining primary tropical forests, which are crucial to avoiding climate catastrophe. The new alliance says that a results-based payments mechanism to reduce deforestation and keep them standing is a priority through UN climate talks. The incoming president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said he would seek to forge a similar alliance in his campaign, with parallel discussions between his team and counterparts in Indonesia and the DRC understood to be happening. Lula will attend Cop27 on Wednesday where he is expected to discuss efforts to save the Amazon and other forests around the world. An eye-catching protest from Extinction Rebellion in Cape Town, South Africa, for Water Day at Cop. They are pointing out that business as usual from the fossil fuel companies equals death. In good news for bloggers everywhere, the Cop presidency is rather optimistically claiming that negotiations will be wrapped up on time. Reuters reports that Cop president, Sameh Shoukry, says the first parts of texts will be “emerging” tonight, with “very few issues” left by Wednesday evening, with publication of “near final” text Thursday, and a deal done by Friday. Our reporters on the ground have said this is surprising as negotiations do not appear to be going very well at all. Experts including Greenpeace’s chief scientist Doug Parr and Business Green’s James Murray responded with some mirth to Shoukry’s timeline. Loss and damage is arguably the most important and contentious issue being negotiated at Cop27, with developing and climate vulnerable nations united behind getting an agreement in Egypt to create a separate funding facility (to cover irreversible economic and non-economic costs) that can then be worked out over the next two years. But the G7 countries – historically the most responsible for the global greenhouse gases causing extreme weather events and slow-onset climate disasters and who have for years delayed and denied the need for a loss and damage fund – are pushing the Global Shield insurance scheme as an alternative. This has not gone down well with climate justice advocates or developing countries, some of which would be excluded for being too developed. Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network, a global network of 1800 civil society groups, criticised the Global Shield as “yet another distraction strategy”. Why not create something new within the UNFCCC process which is more comprehensive and responds to the needs of developing countries, like the loss and damage facility, rather than investing their energies in an opaque initiative outside this process which is very limiting. It’s because they want to be in control, but this is just another way to delay progress on loss and damage ... Insurance companies went bankrupt after Hurricane Katrina, and there are many other stories from the US and Europe of places that have become uninsurable because of increasing frequency and intensity of climate disasters. Insurance is not the answer, this is a deception. Teresa Anderson, global lead on climate justice for ActionAid International, described the initiative as a “distraction.” “An initiative that involves northern countries subsidising northern-owned insurance corporations should not be mistaken for loss and damage finance that supports communities on the front lines of the climate crisis.” The insurance would not cover noneconomic impacts like loss of language and culture or the slow onset impact of sea level rise and melting glaciers, instead focusing on easier to quantify climate shocks like floods, hurricanes and wildfires. We’ve been reporting a lot on the lack of food at Cop (it’s been on our reporters’ minds for obvious reasons). But my colleague Damian Carrington has found that vegan campaigners have capitalised on the burger shortage. Plant Based Treaty has partnered with local vegan cafe Veganist Sharm to distribute hundreds of free vegan burgers in the Green Zone to hungry delegates. On Friday, Nilgün Engin and her team distributed 300 burgers in less than two hours and due to popular demand they will be returning with 400 vegan burgers on Monday in the Peace Park outside the Green Zone at 12pm. Nilgün Engin, Plant Based Treaty campaigner said, “The scarcity of plant-based food options at Cop27 is astonishing given we are at a climate summit. A third of greenhouse gas emissions come from food and Cop27 should be showcasing climate-friendly plant-based food solutions rather than being part of the problem.” There are barely any climate-friendly, plant-based meal offerings at the climate conference. The Cop27 menu features beef, chicken, fish and dairy products. One of the major themes today at Cop27 is water – a subject of particular relevance to Egypt and much of water-starved Africa that isn’t always discussed at Cop. The Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, has said the country’s water resources can no longer meet the needs of its growing population. According to CNN: “In May, the Minister of Local Development announced that the country had entered a stage of ‘water poverty’ according to UN standards. The UN doesn’t have a metric for ‘water poverty’, but by its definition a country is considered water scarce when annual supplies drop below 1,000 cubic meters per capita, which the minister reported was the case.” Egypt relies on the Nile for at least 90% of its fresh water supply, along with Sudan to the south which is also heavily reliant on the river, yet this vital water supply is currently under threat from both climate change and the filling of Egypt’s Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (Gerd), intended to provide electric power to much of the country. Ethiopia, Egypt and to some extent Sudan have been locked in a bitter war of words over the filling of the dam’s reservoir, which Ethiopia began unilaterally and in secret, following multiple rounds of talks about water sharing that went nowhere. Gerd threatens to drastically curtail the supply of water to the Blue Nile, which runs through Ethiopia and into Sudan before it meets the White Nile in Khartoum. Ethiopian officials say the hydroelectric power the dam provides is vital to their development, but others in Sudan and Egypt fear that it could prove to be an existential threat. One human rights activist based in Khartoum said the dam risks causing “a water war,” when I interviewed him on this issue shortly before the dam went online. Meanwhile, while Egyptian officials have spoken of a nationwide need to conserve water, Sisi is also building a new capital in the desert outside of Cairo that features a “green river” of planted vegetation and a series of interlocking fake lakes. UK Foreign Office climate and nature minister Lord Goldsmith has written us a guest post on rainforests: In between all the formal events, we’ve made really huge progress on forests. For example Indonesia’s key minister, Minister Nurbaya, has put forward a really high ambition plan involving protecting 66m ha of forest, restoring 9m ha of degraded peatland, planting 600,000 ha of mangrove and transferring millions of hectares of land to indigenous communities to look after. As Indonesia has said, the UK has played a really central role in this and we have committed to bringing together a coalition of support. Lula’s election in Brazil also changes everything in Latin America, and it is for the rich world to come together to support his very ambitious vision of stopping deforestation and supporting the persecuted indigenous communities. And we knew all this is possible. There are plenty of countries already doing it. Gabon, Costa Rica and many others have broken the link between economic development and environmental destruction. So, obviously Cop27 is a crucial event for the future of the planet, and we are discussing many important and incredibly depressing issues. However, there is still room for a bit of fun, I think. My colleague Nina Lakhani has noticed how many people at Cop are wearing stunning outfits, dressing colourfully and beautifully each day at the conference centre. She says: “One of the best things about attending Cop is the opportunity to meet folks from every corner of the planet, many of whom come wearing bright and beautiful traditional clothes. The Guardian team, which it’s fair to say would not win any best dressed competitions, wants your help honouring the best dressed Cop27 participants so if you’re here, please send in photos. If possible include the delegate’s name, country/Indigenous community, and role at Cop27.” We’ve got a couple below, which Nina has taken. During Cop weeks, scientists publish a huge swathe of depressing climate studies with the hope of focusing negotiators’ minds. Today’s State of the Climate in Asia 2021 report from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), has found that economic losses from drought, floods and landslides have rocketed in Asia. In 2021 alone, weather and water-related hazards caused total damage of US$ 35.6bn, affecting nearly 50 million people. These climate change impacts are wreaking an ever-increasing human, financial and environmental toll, worsening food insecurity and poverty and holding back sustainable development. Relevantly, for today, the future climate scenarios would likely cause extreme water stress. High mountain Asia, including the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, contains the largest volume of ice outside of the polar region, with approximately an area of 100,000 km2 of glacier coverage. The rate of glacier retreat is accelerating and many glaciers suffered from intense mass losses as the result of exceptionally warm and dry conditions in 2021. These so-called water towers of the world are vital for freshwater supplies for the most densely populated part of the planet and so glacier retreat has major implications for future generations. “The climate indicators and extreme events shown this report and expected increase in precipitation over much of Asia in the future shows just how vital it is to strengthen early warning systems,” said WMO secretary General, Prof Petteri Taalas. “The UN Early Warnings for All programme will help protect people from more frequent and intense extreme weather – and there are major gaps to be filled in Asia.” Update on Lula – we are hearing that instead of speaking today, he may be addressing the conference on Wednesday instead. We will keep you posted. Those of us from the UK might remember the “anti-growth coalition” comments made by Liz Truss during her short and chaotic stint as prime minister. Well, a former advisor to No 10, who worked under Boris Johnson and left in May this year, has started a campaign to tackle just that. Truss appeared to believe tackling growth issues involved cutting taxes for the very wealthiest, borrowing a tonne of money to do so, fracking the living daylights out of the British countryside and banning solar power. Sam Richards, who today launches his new campaign Britain Remade, has a slightly different approach. The typical British family is now £6.8K worse off than a German family, £13.5K worse off than an American family, and, if we continue our current trajectory, is set to be poorer than a Polish family by the early 2030s. We believe that Britain’s economic decline is not inevitable, but a result of political choices. Too often, politicians choose to prioritise loud well-organised special interests over the majority of voters. If we’re to reduce our reliance on foreign gas and slash bills, we need to address the bottlenecks in our planning system preventing new supply of energy from being built. It is, to give one example, utterly baffling that the Government looks set to keep the effective ban on onshore wind farms at the same time as forking out billions to cap household and business energy bills this winter. Too often policy mistakes, like the continued ban on onshore wind, happen because politicians listen to a vocal minority of voters opposed to building. In fact, polling we’ve commissioned shows there is majority support for new wind and solar projects. And the old government SpAd team has joined together to voice these concerns – Alok Sharma’s former advisor Eamonn Ives supports the campaign. He said: “I would encourage anyone and everyone to follow their work. Such an important endeavour, headed up by some of the smartest people I know!” My colleague Fiona Harvey had a great chat with Labour’s Ed Miliband over the weekend. Labour’s shadow climate and environment secretary outlined his plans for an international renewable energy coalition, gave his thoughts on King Charles being banned from Cop, and praised Cop26 president Alok Sharma but said that our government has let him down by being rubbish on climate and undermining him. Read her full interview below – it is well worth a look. Good morning from Sharm el-Sheikh and welcome to our coverage of week two of Cop27. Here is what to look out for on water and gender day of the climate summit: Countries are holding an informal stock taking plenary this morning of Cop27 so far, with the UN climate boss Simon Stiell urging countries to use their remaining time in Egypt to “build the bridge needed” to make progress on 1.5C, adaptation, finance, and loss and damage. If you want to go into the detail on the level of agreement so far, Carbon Brief’s senior policy editor Simon Evans has gone through the negotiation draft texts and highlighted the progress (or lack of it). Note that something being [in brackets] in UN negotiations means that it is still being negotiated. Water and the effects of the climate crisis on water scarcity will come under scrutiny on Monday, reports the Guardian’s environment editor Fiona Harvey. She has written a fantastic curtain raiser on what to look out for this week. World leaders are meeting at the G20 in Bali, Indonesia over the next two days, where the climate crisis will be discussed by major powers. Xi and Biden are scheduled to speak, with climate talks still suspended between the world’s largest economies after house speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, which China said violated its sovereignty. Thanks for following along. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian’s Cop27 liveblog. I’m Helena Horton, an environment reporter here at the Guardian, and will be running the blog until my colleague Bibi Van Der Zee takes over this afternoon. We are over halfway through ( unless it over-runs!) and today is looking to be jam-packed. It’s also water day, and those of us who have lived through drought this year will know what a crucial issue that is. Today there will be a large focus on gender, and we will be hearing from Indigenous women later on.

Stay safe and dry out there! Here were today’s major developments: Jim Chalmers and Peter Dutton have butted heads today on the Indigenous voice to parliament. The treasurer said Dutton had “reached for the Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison playbook” and was seeking to sow division rather than genuinely desiring more detail on the voice. The opposition leader hit back, suggesting “Bob Hawke or John Howard would never have conducted themselves this way”. New Zealand’s new prime minister Chris Hipkins used his first address today to thank his predecessor Jacinda Ardern as an “inspiration to women and girls everyone”. He promised to focus on “bread and butter” issues that “people care about”. Two National Disability Insurance Scheme providers and five people associated with them have been banned from providing services to people with a disability, following fraud claims. And the NSW Coalition is on track to lose the March state election as premier Dominic Perrottet’s popularity wanes. A YouGov poll, published in The Sunday Telegraph, shows the government well behind in both first preference and two-party preferred standings. The people have spoken – and they really like tennis. Police investigate alleged act of animal cruelty near Wollongong An investigation is under way following an alleged act of animal cruelty near Wollongong in New South Wales. A man was bushwalking at Mount Ousley at about 8.30am when he heard a dog yelping. The man searched the area and found an upside-down kennel at the base of an escarpment, where an Australian bulldog was located injured. The dog also appeared emaciated and of poor health. Police were alerted and officers, along with the SES, attended and conducted a rescue operation. It’s believed the kennel had been thrown off the cliff in the early hours of today. The dog was taken to a local vet but was euthanised due to its poor condition and injuries. Jim Chalmers also said it was “not our expectation” that Australia would go into recession in 2023. The treasurer was responding to a journalist who asked the direct question: “Do you think Australia is at risk of going into recession this year?” (This is always a tricky question for a treasurer to answer; part of the role is to encourage confidence in the economy. Treasurers tend to avoid using the R-word for that reason.) Chalmers’s full reply: That’s not our expectation. Our expectation is that the Australian economy will continue to grow, but so will some of these challenges that we’ve been talking about today. The expectation in the Treasury forecasts in October were that the Australian economy will begin to soften a bit this year, and that is the inevitable likely consequence of higher interest rates and a slowing global economy. But their expectation isn’t that Australia will go backwards. I’m optimistic about the prospects for our economy, the prospects for our country, but we’ve got to be realistic about the implications of what’s happening around the world as well. Our budget and our plan is not about crossing our fingers and hoping for the best, it’s about making the budget more responsible, the economy more resilient, and that’s what our economic plan is all about. Treasurer expects China’s economy to rebound strongly Let’s return to a press conference held earlier today by Jim Chalmers now that the transcript is out. Given the lunar new year, the treasurer was asked about 2023 being the Year of the Rabbit and whether it could bring further diplomatic bridge-building with China. Chalmers started by saying the Chinese economy would have a big impact on the performance of Australia’s own economy. He said he expected the Chinese economy to “rebound relatively strongly and relatively quickly but it’s in a pretty weak position right now though”. He also mentioned the Albanese government’s ongoing push for Beijing to lift trade actions against a range of Australian products, including tariffs on wine and barley, and unofficial bans on products like coal and lobster: We’ve said for some time that we want to see those trade restrictions lifted. There are tens of billions of dollars of value in Australian exports tied up in those trade restrictions, and our view is that we give ourselves the best chance to work through difficult issues like this if we engage. I pay tribute to prime minister Albanese and ministers Wong and Marles and Farrell and others for engaging with Chinese counterparts in an attempt to stabilise the relationship. We want the region to be peaceful and prosperous, we want our exporters to take advantage of big markets like the Chinese market because it’s good for jobs here in Australia. And so we want to see those trade restrictions lifted. Obviously, we follow the reporting and the speculation about if and when they might be lifted. Our job is to engage where we can, to disagree where we have to, and one of the highest priorities that we’ve put to our Chinese counterparts is to see those trade restrictions lifted. Pressed on when we could expect to see any tangible actions on the trade restrictions, Chalmers said it “remains to be seen” but added: Clearly the efforts that the prime minister and his cabinet have put in have been worthwhile. We have said since before the election that we want to see a more stable relationship with China ... We’re under no illusions about some of the difficulties and some of the complexities in this relationship, we’ve been upfront about that as well. But we give ourselves the best chance to work through these issues if we engage, and that’s what we’ve been doing. More on the story so far: Australian Open upsets continue as Stosur says farewell It’s been a year of upsets at the Australian Open and they shock results continued on day seven. This is the first time in history the two top seeds in both the men’s and women’s draws are out of the tournament before the quarter-finals. Women’s world number one Iga Świątek was today knocked out in two sets by 22nd-seed Elena Rybakina, while Coco Gauff was also taken down by Jelena Ostapenko in a 7-5, 6-3 thriller. Elsewhere, Australian great Samantha Stosur has bid farewell to tennis after her final match in mixed doubles alongside Matt Ebden. Read Tumaini Carayol’s match report of Rybanika’s upset win here: One dead after single-vehicle crash in Victoria A person has died in a single-vehicle car crash in north-east Victoria this afternoon. Victoria Police believe a car hit a tree on Mitchell Road in Kialla at around 1.50pm. Emergency services attended the scene, but the driver couldn’t be revived. Police are investigating whether the driver experienced a medical episode before the incident. Four arrests in Sydney’s northern beaches Four men have been arrested and investigations are continuing following an alleged assault and police pursuit on the northern beaches in Sydney. About 9.30am, police were called to a Manly street following reports of an assault. Officers attended and were told those involved had left the area in a Toyota Hilux. Police attempted to stop the car at Forestville, but a pursuit began when the driver allegedly failed to stop. Officers deployed road spikes and stopped the car, where they found five men including one with injuries who was taken to hospital for treatment. The four other men were arrested and taken to Manly police station. Bulk billing under pressure after payroll tax decisions Australians could be slugged up to 15% extra for a trip to the doctor if states follow through on a new payroll tax interpretation. Royal Australian College of General Practitioners vice-president and Queensland chair, Dr Bruce Willett, says updated rulings of existing payroll laws are poised to heap further pressure on the ailing bulk-billing network. This is not a Queensland issue. This is basically a whole-of-country issue. All of the states have an agreement where they co-ordinate the application of payroll tax. The problems actually started in NSW and Victoria, who have been the most aggressive chasing payroll tax. Dr Willett said the Queensland government has been co-operating on changes to payroll tax laws following separate rulings in Victoria and NSW. Previously, medical practices did not pay payroll tax for tenant doctors as they were considered contractors and their wage was not included as part of the overall business. That’s been the arrangement for 30 years and that’s all been hunky dory. What’s happened is, particularly in NSW and Victoria, [governments] have taken a very aggressive view and deemed that to be an employee/employer relationship. It effectively means practices with tenant doctors will have to pay payroll tax on 100% of what they bill moving forward. In Queensland, businesses which pay $6.5m or less a year in taxable wages are subject to a payroll tax rate of 4.75%. The rate rises to 4.95% for businesses with annual taxable wages above $6.5m. Dr Willett said the former rate was more than the profit margin for most practices, meaning they won’t be able to absorb the change without passing on the cost to patients. As a result, he expects out-of-pocket fees to increase by about 15% as GPs will still feel obliged to bulk bill some patients but not others. Queensland’s shadow treasurer David Janetzki said the “new tax” would have serious consequences for the state’s residents. This new stealth tax will drive up patient fees and emergency department presentations and drive down bulk billing. But unlike other states, the Queensland Revenue Office has pledged not to backdate payroll tax bills for affected clinics, agreeing to limit audits to the 2021/2022 financial year and beyond. Queensland transport minister Mark Bailey disputed the payroll tax ruling would lead to higher doctor fees for patients. The state government revenue people do not specifically target the health sector at all, whereas in other states I know that they do. This is a payroll tax level that is the lowest in the country and we need reform in the GP sector at a federal level after a decade of neglect. I think some of the accusations were inaccurate this morning. He branded a report in The Courier Mail a “beat-up” and said the Albanese government was working to address issues in the primary care network, including a well-publicised shortage of bulk-billing appointments. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews and NSW counterpart Dominic Perrottet have been publicly lobbying for national cabinet to make reforming the sector its number one priority this year. National cabinet is next scheduled to meet on 1 February. – AAP ChatGPT banned in New South Wales schools over cheating fears Students in NSW state schools will not be able to access artificial intelligence applications like ChatGPT while at school. There are concerns ChatGPT is helping students cheat on assessments because of the program’s ability to compose human-like writing in response to any prompt or instruction. NSW is the first Australian state or territory to restrict access to the application on student devices or while students are using their personal device on the school network. Megan Kelly, the department’s acting deputy secretary, said the changes will start later this month when students go back to school. This will be in place while we review how to safely and appropriately use this emerging technology in the classroom. The department will also be providing further guidance to teachers on our robust assessment practices in place to ensure all students play by the rules. In the US, New York City’s education department earlier this month implemented a similar ban on ChatGPT. Australian universities are also addressing the emergence of artificial intelligence applications, with the Group of Eight universities moving to more in-person supervision and increased paper assessments this year. – AAP Man arrested after body of woman found in Melbourne home A man has been arrested following the death of a woman in Lilydale. Police attended a property on John Street about 5.30pm on 21 January in response to a call for assistance. The female resident, who is yet to be formally identified, died at the scene. A crime scene has been set up while homicide squad detectives work to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident, the death is being treated as suspicious. A 46-year-old Lilydale man is currently assisting detectives with their enquiries. It is believed both parties are known to each other. – AAP Search under way after fatal WA boat incident A woman has died and a man is in hospital after a boat ran into a navigation device in Perth’s south. Police were called to Mandurah estuary about 10pm on Saturday night after a boat with four people on board struck a red post marker. A 54-year-old woman was recovered from the water but could not be revived and died at the scene, police confirmed in a statement on Sunday. A 47-year-old man, believed to be the boat’s driver, was taken to hospital with serious injuries, while a 54-year-old man was uninjured. Emergency services are searching for a 52-year-old women who remains unaccounted for. – AAP Dashcam footage may be key to murder investigation Queensland police have asked the public for help with an investigation following the death of a man overnight. A 43-year-old man was found injured on Newmarket Road, not far from his home. Despite efforts by paramedics, the man died from his wounds. Speaking to media, regional Crime Coordinator Detective Superintendent Andrew Massingham said police believed the man had been stabbed. Our preliminary investigations indicate that the deceased was in some altercation with some persons prior to his death. It is important that we identify those persons and we believe passing traffic will lead us to identify those persons. Earlier, police arrested a 17-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl after they were stopped by police nearby. The 17-year-old boy was stopped by police and a search allegedly revealed a 45cm concealed knife in a sheaf. A 17-year-old girl was also questioned by police and was arrested for assaulting police after she allegedly became aggressive and attacked one of the officers at the scene. The two were taken to a “place of safety” at a nearby address and were issued with notices to appear, 17-year-old boy for possession of a weapon in a public place and the girl for assaulting police. The body of the 43-year-old man was found 1.5 hours later. Police are investigating whether there is any connection and two crime scenes have been set up. No charges have been laid against the two children in relation to the man’s death and police say they are making further inquiries. They have appealed to anyone driving along Newmarket Road between 11pm and 2am who may have dashcam footage to supply it to police. Prime minister Anthony Albanese is the latest to offer his lunar new year wishes. Inflation tipped to peak in latest data release Economists are optimistic Australia’s sky-high inflation will start to come back to earth after the release of fresh data on the cost-of-living crisis. The Australian Bureau of Statistics will unveil consumer price index (CPI) figures for the December quarter on Wednesday amid soaring costs for many household staples. Commonwealth Bank analysts are forecasting inflation to jump 1.7% over the quarter, up from an increase of 1.3% for the same period a year earlier. CommSec chief economist Craig James told the bank’s podcast he expected growth. We’re knocking out a smaller number with a bigger number so, as a result, we’re going to see stronger annual growth. In its November meeting minutes, the Reserve Bank of Australia said it expected headline inflation to peak around eight per cent and underlying inflation to top out at 6.5% at the end of 2022 before both begin to fall early this year. No update was made to either forecast following its meeting in December. On Thursday, ABS jobs data showed the national unemployment rate steadied at 3.5% in December, suggesting the economy is slowing. The RBA will be keeping a close eye on the latest inflation figures ahead of its meeting early next month to decide on a possible ninth consecutive interest rate hike. – AAP El Niño may be coming, here’s what it might mean for Australia Australia’s weather – dominated for three years by La Niña conditions in the Pacific that soaked the east of the country – could be about to flip into a hotter and drier phase. But what might the potential arrival of La Niña’s hotter and drier cousin, El Niño, mean for Australians still recovering from the floods of recent years, and our ecosystems? Some scientists are fearing the worst, with an El Niño raising the chances of dangerous bushfire weather, longer and fiercer heatwaves and severe coral bleaching across the Great Barrier Reef. However it is not clear yet whether an El Niño will develop with some uncertainty within the available models for at least the next few months. For the latest on what’s coming and what it means, read the full report in the Guardian: New Zealand’s new prime minister Chris Hipkins is speaking now and has used his first address to thank his predecessor Jacinda Ardern as an “inspiration to women and girls everyone”. New Zealand is in a much better position compared to most countries, economically and socially. Because of her leadership and the critical decisions that she made. Her leadership has been an inspiration to women and girls everywhere. But it is also a reminder that we have a way to go when it comes to ensuring that women in leadership receive the same respect as their male counterparts. He has promised to focus on “bread and butter” issues that “people care about”. You should not have to be on a six-figure salary to afford to buy a house, to support your children, and to have enough to retire on. Access to those basic needs, access to those basics need to be extended to all those striving for better. Two National Disability Insurance Scheme providers and five people associated with them have been banned from providing services to people with a disability, following fraud claims. Millennium Disability Care and A.C.N have been permanently prohibited from providing NDIS supports after a fraud taskforce found evidence of fake and inappropriate claims. A.C.N 615 641 079 Pty Ltd is listed on Asic registers as operating businesses Australian Home And Community Care and SIL finder, which bills itself as a disability accommodation platform to help NDIS participants find homes. The five people were also banned from providing services to people with a disability, with prohibitions ranging from five to 10 years. NDIS minister Bill Shorten said the action sent “a strong message to any provider trying to take advantage of the NDIS and Australian taxpayers”. Australians relying on the NDIS are some of our most vulnerable, and any organisation taking advantage of their safety net must be stopped. For too long, rogue providers have been able to make use of a lack of communication and coordination between government agencies. NDIS commissioner Tracy Mackey said the commission would take swift action against any provider failing to meet their obligations. – AAP Police investigate Melbourne shooting believed to be targeted attack Armed crime squad detectives are investigating after a man was shot several times in Melbourne overnight. Victoria police say the victim was in a stationary car in Deer Park just after 9pm on Friday night when the shooting occurred. They sustained non-life-threatening injuries and are being treated at hospital. Victoria police say the shooting was believed to be a targeted attack. It’s lunar new year today, with events planned throughout the country through to the end of January. Political leaders and bodies are continuing to post messages of well wishes for 2023. Foreign minister Penny Wong is celebrating at Zhu-Lin Buddhist Temple in South Australia. For the Chinese, Korean and Taiwanese Sunday marks the start of the Year of the Rabbit. To the Vietnamese, the day welcomes the Year of the Cat. Thunderstorms forecast along eastern Australia Severe thunderstorms are possible across regional Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria this afternoon while out west fire danger ratings have been forecast for Western Australia. Governments warned grid-scale batteries should be pared with solar Grid-linked batteries operating on the best settings for financial rewards might make commercial sense but could also power up greenhouse gas emissions. Research by the battery storage and grid integration program at the Australian National University has warned of the emissions trade-off in the short-term. The paper published in the journal Energy Policy recommends the federal government provide system-wide carbon incentives to encourage battery charging and discharge during particular time periods. Researcher Louise Bardwell said battery storage was “really important long-term” but the source of its power had to be considered. They’ve become this ‘solve anything’ solution – they sound really fancy, a cool piece of tech, so people want to throw them in everywhere. A battery isn’t necessarily going to be charging off wind or solar, it can charge off anything in the grid – and at times that will probably be black coal. Bardwell said Australian governments are jumping on the battery bandwagon without thinking carefully about their placement and use. It may charge up when it’s cheaper and discharge when hydro or something else is operating at the margins – that’s technically what it’s displacing. Energy storage could play a significant role in Australia’s emissions reduction targets of 43% by 2030 and net zero by 2050. Changing to more generation of wind and solar requires a way to store energy when there’s more than the electricity grid needs in order to use it at another time when energy is scarce. The Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia was the world’s first big battery. Surpassing it, the Victorian Big Battery operated by Neoen can store enough energy to power more than one million homes for 30 minutes. Queensland is the latest to emerge as a potential battery industry leader, putting up $500m to invest in commercial-scale and community batteries accompanied by a push for local manufacturing. The Albanese government has also committed to the rollout of 400 community batteries in neighbourhoods across the country for more affordable and secure solar power. – AAP Murder investigation under way after man found dead in Queensland A man has been found dead in Brisbane’s north overnight, sparking a murder probe. The man’s body was discovered along Newmarket Road in Wilston about 1.50am on Sunday, with a crime scene set up and a homicide investigation launched. Another man and a woman were located nearby and are being spoken to by police. – AAP Australia refuses to budge over protected products in EU free trade negotiations Federal assistant minister for trade Tim Ayres says negotiation for an Australian-EU free trade deal have been “very constructive” despite some “hard issues”. Speaking from Rome on Sunday, Ayres said the EU was a “very significant market” which would give Australian producers access to 400 million people but negotiations have not been without tensions. One of those tensions has been efforts by the EU to stop Australian producers from using the name of protected products like feta, parmesan and prosecco. Australian trade minister, Don Farrell, who has been leading negotiations has previously made it clear this was one area where Australia would not give ground. Ayres said the issue is being worked through by the negotiating teams. It’s not as if Australians have gone to Europe and taken these varieties and brought them back. These are Italian-Australian families who’ve come from Italy with wine varieties, grown them in Australia, brought their food culture and their food production methods to Australia with them and made that part of Australian food culture and the Australian agricultural production system. So, we feel very strongly about these issues. Australians feel very strongly about them. It’s also important to appreciate how important these issues are to European cultural identity as well. So, this is one of the issues we’re going to have to find our way through. This is an important deal. It’s of enormous economic benefit and we’re going to have to make sure that we work through these issues in a calm and methodical way in the interest of our constituencies. For more background on this issue, read this previous report by Guardian Australia foreign affairs and defence reporter Daniel Hurst. NSW Labor taking nothing for granted: Minns New South Wales Labor leader Chris Minns says he isn’t paying attention to polling suggesting the state government is set for a defeat at the upcoming election in March. I don’t want anyone in NSW to think we’re taking anything for granted. We’ve got a huge task ahead of us. We’re hungry but we’re humble as well about our prospects. A YouGov poll, published in The Sunday Telegraph on Sunday, has suggested the popularity of premier Dominic Perrottet is falling with the Coalition well behind in both first preference and two-party standings. – with AAP Let’s bring you some more quotes from those duelling Sky News interviews, when the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, hit back at the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, over the voice to parliament. To recap: in the first interview, Chalmers said Dutton was really seeking to sow division rather than genuinely seeking detail. Chalmers focused on the principle behind the referendum that will be conducted later this year: This is Australia’s big chance to move forward together in a spirit of unity and respect and to give First Nations people a say in the issues that affect their communities. Chalmers went on to say that Dutton had “reached for the Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison playbook, which says that the best chances for him to be successful politically is if the nation fails to grab this terrific opportunity do the right thing”. Dutton, interviewed shortly after Chalmers, hit back. The opposition leader said: Honestly, let’s be serious about it. Bob Hawke or John Howard would never have conducted themselves this way. You can’t just say that we’re going to change the constitution. There are legitimate concerns that people have about the interventions from the High Court, the way in which that could be interpreted and expanded. There are legitimate questions that people have about the detail, the operation. All of us share in common a desire to help Indigenous Australians, but if the prime minister of the day can’t stand up and explain the detail of what it is he’s asking people to vote for, how can people be expected to vote for it? Lunar new year celebrations begin around Australia Australia’s political leaders and some government bodies have sent their best wishes for those celebrating lunar new year. The holiday marks the largest human migration as hundreds of millions of people travel to visit families. Here are some of what they have said: To mark the day, events are planned throughout the country. In Melbourne there will be lion dancing, dragon parade and market stalls on Little Bourke Street. In Sydney, there were market stalls in Haymarket and fireworks displays over Darling Harbour with the displays to continue until 29 January. Down in Adelaide a street party will be held in Chinatown on the weekend of the 28th. For the Chinese, Korean and Taiwanese Sunday marks the start of the Year of the Rabbit. To the Vietnamese, the day welcomes the Year of the Cat – and they sure know how to celebrate. Two police officers charged with assault Two Victorian police officers have been charged with assault after they allegedly injured a man during an arrest. The 58-year-old man was treated in hospital after the incident in Narre Warren South, in Melbourne’s south-east, on 4 February last year. The two male senior constables, aged 35 and 45, were immediately suspended from duty after the incident. Police and the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission have been investigating, with the two men charged on Sunday with unlawful assault and unlawful assault with a weapon. They are due to face the Melbourne magistrates court in March. – AAP Researcher find parental support linked to teen internet addition Research from the University of Sydney Business School has found teenagers who feel well-supported by their parents are more likely to report increased internet addiction over time. A study of nearly 3,000 teenagers aged 14 to 17 as they moved between year 8 to year 11 sought to investigate links between social support and compulsive internet use. Researchers found teenagers who reported high levels of social support form parents were more likely to report compulsive internet use. The teenagers who reported compulsive use were likely to afterwards report a decline in social support from teenagers. Compulsive internet use, also referred to as problematic internet use, refers to difficulty regulating internet use, and often involves withdrawal symptoms, rumination about being online when not online, and disengagement from daily activities. The study, published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, found on average that: Adolescents engage with the internet more intensively as they progress through high school; Support from friends was consistently higher than support from parents and teachers across the four years of the study; and Parental support marginally declined over the course of grades 8 to 11. Dr James Donald, lead investigator and senior lecturer in Work and Organisational Studies, said the biggest surprise was that parental social support led adolescents to experience greater compulsive internet use over time – which in turn led to less support from teachers. He speculated that the reason for this comes down to teen’s perception of what constitutes parental support. There are several ways parents can manage the threat of internet addiction. They can take no action, co-use or joint access the internet, discuss usage in a positive way, monitor, and/or set rules and limits, which may involve punishment. We speculate that refraining from mediation may be popular with youth and even lead them to perceive their parents as being more supportive. However, previous studies have found parental refraining is associated with increased compulsive internet use. This ‘popular parents, compulsive youth’ explanation appears consistent with our results. And it’s important to note this methodology is only useful for predicting change in behaviour. On average, supportive parenting is still associated with less compulsive internet use. Tough new quarantine laws to bring pets into the country Tougher quarantine rules designed to protect against the risk of a rabies outbreak could lead to a blowout in wait times for people looking to bring pets into the country. Currently it takes about six months to apply to bring in a cat or dog from almost 70 countries, including the UK, Italy, Canada and US, and each animal must do at least 10 days of quarantine at a facility in Melbourne. From 1 March, animals from those countries must have their identity confirmed by a government-approved vet and then have a rabies blood test. If their identity can’t be confirmed by an approved professional, they must do 30 days in quarantine. Brisbane-based breeder Paul Hewitt described it as a “crazy scheme”. He said he understood concerns about rabies but feared new rules would lead to long wait times for animals to book into quarantine. There is a problem, but they’ve come up with the wrong solution. Australia is free of rabies, a normally fatal viral infection that is usually transmitted through the bite or scratch of an infected animal. Dogs Victoria’s Linda Beer said her organisation supported measures to reduce biosecurity risks but some members had raised concerns about an apparent lack of transition period. She said some breeders feared US authorities did not have processes or staff in place to facilitate government-approved veterinary ID checks by the cut-off date. This meant people who had already started the expensive importation process would need to either start again or have their pets serve the longer 30-day quarantine period. The Australian Veterinary Association said extended quarantine was regrettable but a rabies outbreak would be devastating for all animals. We do urge the government, however, to work towards solutions to minimise waiting times and improve capacity in the [quarantine] facility, so that the impact on pet owners can be minimised. Ten days of quarantine costs about $2,000 but that will rise to $2,600 for 30 days, excluding the cost of transporting animals or boarding fees at kennels in other countries. The changes do not apply to animals returning to Australia or coming from rabies-free countries. The changes were prompted by an increased risk of rabies in imported animals and an uptick in fraudulent documents being used. – AAP New Australian factory to make construction material from recycled goods A company making construction products entirely from used drink cartons, soft plastics, disposable coffee cops and similar products will launch its first Australian manufacturing plant at Warragamba next month. SaveBOARD also has plans for two more plants to produce its sturdy, lightweight alternative to conventional plasterboard, plywood or particle board that is also totally recyclable. Supply chain specialist Chris Collimore said the process involves significantly less carbon than manufacturing traditional building products and eliminates the need for glues or chemical additives as the raw materials are bonded using heat and compression. It’s basically like making a big cheese toasty. You heat it up and cool it down a couple of times and the plastic melts between the gaps in the fibre. It’s a straightforward process, but it’s focused on reducing problematic waste ... materials which, until we came along, had been completely un-recyclable and collected by container deposit schemes. Circular Australia chief executive Lisa McLean recently told the Commonwealth Bank’s annual sustainability conference in Sydney that the circular economy could help save Australia trillions In Australia alone, we could unlock a massive $2tn worth of potential savings across two decades. Those potential savings could come, for example, through reusing valuable resources currently going to waste in landfill, such as plastics, glass, masonry and metals. In addition, buildings and equipment could be repaired and adapted rather than replaced. Collimore said genuine solutions also needed strong partnerships. SaveBOARD has agreements with container deposit schemes across Australia and expects within months to be utilising their entire collection volumes. Packaging and retail companies including major supermarket chains have been equally supportive. A saveBOARD plant is already up and running in Hamilton, New Zealand, diverting 40 tonnes of waste from landfill annually. – with AAP NSW Labor promises hospital bed boost Western Sydney residents could have access to another 600 hospital beds as NSW Labor promises to deal with a shortage if elected. The boost will include $700m to fund 300 more beds at Rouse Hill hospital. NSW Labor has been going hard on the government over health funding as it seeks to woo voters at the state election in March. Opposition leader Chris Minns pointed to western Sydney’s growing population. For far too long healthcare in western Sydney has been an afterthought. The thousands of people moving into the area every year deserve world class healthcare. The upgrade at Rouse Hill will also mean the hospital moves to Labor’s proposed campus model. Childcare and healthcare worker accommodation will be on site. Health workers have held multiple strikes and actions since the Covid-19 pandemic begun in 2020, calling for better working conditions. – AAP The trains may still be running but the Sydney ferries have been made to wait. Swift and Lawrence winners at Golden Guitar awards Andrew Swift has taken out the award for Male Artist of the Year at the Golden Guitar awards in Tamworth while Amber Lawrence beat out previous winner Ashleigh Dallas for best female artist. Dallas, however, didn’t go home empty-handed with her album, In The Moment, named traditional country album of the year. Husband and wife do Brooke McClymont and Adam Eckersley took home awards in both Song of the Year and single of the year, as well as being named group or duo of the year. They were joined on stage by their 10-year-old daughter who helped write their songs – the youngest winners ever. Breakout talent Johnston took home two awards for new talent of the year and vocal collaboration fo their single Same Songs with Kaylee Bell. Meanwhile Colin Buchanan was inducted into the Australasian Country Music Roll of Renown, joining greats such as Slim Dusty, Kasey Chambers and frequent collaborator Lee Kernaghan. The NSW Coalition is on track to lose the March state election as premier Dominic Perrottet’s popularity wanes. A YouGov poll, published in The Sunday Telegraph, shows the government well behind in both first preference and two-party preferred standings. Labor led the coalition by 56 per cent to 44 per cent on a two-party preferred basis, while it was ahead by 39-33 per cent on first preferences. Both figures point to a majority for Labor, which was buoyed in the poll by strong backing from young voters. Support for Perrottet also dropped, with only 44 per cent of those surveyed preferring him over Labor leader Chris Minns. It comes after the premier confessed earlier this month that he wore a Nazi costume to his 21st birthday party. Perrottet apologised for his behaviour, describing the incident as a naive mistake that did not reflect his current views. He made the admission after the issue was raised by transport minister David Elliott, but the premier maintains he has the support of his party. Meanwhile, NSW Labor has also been embroiled in controversy with one of its high-profile upper house candidates pulling out of the election race on Friday. The withdrawal of Khal Asfour, the mayor of Canterbury Bankstown, came after allegations he used ratepayer funds to buy designer clothing and spa treatments. Minns took exception to some of the allegations and defended backing Asfour. I didn’t know about these revelations ... at any stage of the election cycle, you’re going to have situations like this. NSW voters go to the polls on 25 March. – AAP Chalmers welcomes New Zealand’s PM The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, also welcomed the incoming New Zealand prime minister, Chris Hipkins. He told Sky News today: We look forward to working together closely with Chris Hipkins and with his cabinet when he names one. This is a huge year for Australia/New Zealand relations. It’s the 40th anniversary of closer economic relations, that agreement that governs the approach to this relationship. Chris Hipkins is someone of immense experience and depth and intelligence. He’s a very worthy successor to prime minister [Jacinda] Ardern. And we look forward to working with him really closely. We’ve got a big trans-Tasman agenda in a really important year. I know the prime minister is looking forward to working with Chris Hipkins and we’re all looking forward to working with his cabinet. Chalmers seeks national conversation about budget spending The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says he wants to have a national conversation about lining “our budget and our economy with our values” and about how to fund key national priorities. In his interview with Sky News this morning, Chalmers did not give any specific hints about the future of the stage 3 tax cuts or other potential measures to fund growing expenditure – but he signalled his interest in having a public debate about fiscal issues as he prepares to hand down the government’s second budget in May. He said he expected defence spending to grow “very strongly”, with key decisions looming on nuclear-powered submarines and the defence strategic review. It’s one of the fastest growing areas of spending in the budget, along with some of those others we’ve discussed on other occasions, and so we need to make sure that we can find room for what is this necessary investment in our national security. Asked whether he would be taking the conversation in the lead-up to the next budget, Chalmers said: That’s my way of saying we need to be upfront with people about what we can afford, and how we make the investments that we might want to make in some of these areas are sustainable over time. And one of the things I’ve been most heartened about, in the first eight months or so of this Albanese Labor government, is people’s willingness to engage on some of these big questions. And so the national conversation that I want to have about the budget is how do we line up our budget and our economy with our values? How do we fund the things that we truly value: looking after people with a disability, strengthening Medicare, doing the right thing by people in aged care, funding national security? All of these big national priorities – how do we find a way to fund them and how do we make that investment sustainable over time? I’m confident the Australian people are up for that conversation; they’ve shown a real willingness. And from our side, we’ve tried to talk up to people, not down to them, about these challenges. We’re optimistic about the future. But we’re realistic about the global economy. And we’re realistic about what we can afford to fund. Chalmers said the government wanted to be “a long-term Labor government” (ie win multiple elections) was “because we know that the best way to effect the change that we want to see in our economy and in our society is over time”. He said it was impossible to “achieve everything that you want to achieve in one budget”. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has taken aim at Peter Dutton over the voice to parliament, saying the opposition leader has “reached for the Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison playbook”. Chalmers used an interview with Sky News this morning to argue Dutton sensed his political interests would be served by a failed voice referendum, Asked if the government had dropped the ball on explaining how the voice would work, Chalmers said: Of course not. This is Australia’s big chance to move forward together in a spirit of unity and respect and to give First Nations people a say in the issues that affect their communities … This should be a unifying moment – it should be something which decided by the people not the politicians. I think some of the language from Peter Dutton has been disappointing. I think people understand that Peter Dutton is not actually looking for more detail here. He’s looking for more division. He’s reached for the Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison playbook, which says that the best chances for him to be successful politically is if the nation fails to grab this terrific opportunity do the right thing and to move forward together in that spirit of unity and respect. In a later interview, also on Sky, Dutton responded that he did not understand the “personal attacks” from Chalmers and others in the government. Dutton said again that he was speaking for “millions of Australians” who “want to hear the detail” of the government’s voice proposal. Dutton did not speculate on whether the Liberal party would come to a unified position, saying: That’s a process question for us down the track. Dutton said he wanted to detail so his party room could have an informed discussion to decide its position. Last week Prof Megan Davis, a Cobble Cobble woman and expert adviser to the government on the referendum process, spoke to the Full Story podcast about Dutton’s “inexplicable” demand for details: The Sydney Harbour Bridge is closed in both directions this morning for filming of a Hollywood blockbuster starring Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt. The movie adaptation of 1980s television series The Fall Guy is a show-stopper for vehicles and pedestrians, with all lanes across the bridge shut from 3am to 10am on Sunday, 22 January. Trains will continue to run across the bridge, which will be closed for all other vehicles as well as pedestrians and cyclists. The Sydney Harbour Tunnel will remain open while filming takes place. The Cahill Expressway over Circular Quay will also be closed for filming on Sunday, in both directions from 1am to 12.30pm. Based on a TV series of the same name, The Fall Guy follows a burnt-out stuntman who moonlights as a bounty hunter, played by Gosling. Filming began in October last year at Disney Studios Australia in Moore Park. Former federal arts minister Paul Fletcher last year said the production would inject more than $244m into the Australian economy. Traffic on the bridge will be disrupted from January 20 to 25 for maintenance on the bridge deck and work on the Warringah Freeway upgrade. – AAP And welcome to another Sunday morning Guardian live blog. Sydney Harbour Bridge has been shut down this morning, this time by a film starring Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, a movie adaptation of the 1980s television series, The Fall Guy. The bridge is closed in both directions until 10am. A Victorian man is in hospital after he has been shot multiple times in Melbourne’s western suburbs in what police believe was a targeted attack. The man is believed to have been stopped in a car just after 9pm when the shots were fired. Another man has also been arrested in a separate incident following the death of a woman in the outer Melbourne suburb of Lilydale. Police responded to a call at about 5.30pm on Saturday but the woman died at the scene. I’m Royce Kurmelovs, taking the blog through the day.

Britishvolt, which in May launched an ambitious effort to create a £1.2bn factory, has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Welsh government ahead of signing a lease for a former Royal Air Force base at Bro Tathan business park, south Wales. The battery manufacturer is aiming to list on the London Stock Exchange, around the first quarter of 2021. It is seeking to raise funds through equity, debt and possibly government grants, said Orral Nadjari, its chief executive. The UK government and car companies have called for the establishment of a gigafactory to ensure the sector holds on to the 168,000 manufacturing jobs as the global automotive industry moves towards electric cars. However, no company before Britishvolt has chosen the UK to build lithium-ion batteries on a large scale. Tesla, the US electric car pioneer led by the billionaire Elon Musk, chose a location near Berlin, Germany, for its first European battery factory, citing Brexit uncertainty as a factor counting against the UK, although this month it backed out of plans to build batteries at the plant. Britishvolt hopes to start building its factory in the second quarter of 2021. The company also intends to build a 200MW solar power plant at the site to supply the factory and reduce its carbon footprint. The Britishvolt plans would represent another boost for Wales’ automotive sector, as the sportscar maker Aston Martin started production of its DBX SUV at a factory also on the same site. The company hopes to eventually provide as many as 3,500 jobs in the area, which was recently impacted by Ford’s decision to close its Bridgend engine plant by September this year. In May Britishvolt signed a separate deal with the specialist battery maker AMTE Power, saying they would work together on plans for a plant to make batteries. Britishvolt is aiming to build factories to manufacture batteries with 30 gigawatt hours (GWh) of capacity a year. The first leg of the plan will require Britishvolt to raise £1.2bn from investors, a significant sum for a company that has so far raised about £10m from a group of Scandinavian and Middle Eastern investors. The company recently elevated Nadjari, one of the founders who was previously chief operating officer, to chief executive. The previous chief executive, Lars Carlström, has taken the role of executive chairman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/jul/09/russia-ukraine-war-ukrainian-soldiers-arrive-in-uk-for-training-battle-to-retake-kherson-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-09T23:19:01Z","webTitle":"UN says both sides share blame for nursing home attack; Russian shelling reported in east – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jul/09/russia-ukraine-war-ukrainian-soldiers-arrive-in-uk-for-training-battle-to-retake-kherson-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/jul/09/russia-ukraine-war-ukrainian-soldiers-arrive-in-uk-for-training-battle-to-retake-kherson-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"UN says both sides share blame for nursing home attack; Russian shelling reported in east – as it happened","bodyText":"This liveblog is closing now. You can continue to see all our coverage of the war in Ukraine here. Thank you for reading. Canada is risking Ukraine’s ire by returning to Germany a repaired giant turbine that will speed the flow of Russian gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, Reuters reports. Canada announced its decision Saturday after originally seizing the damaged turbine, owned by Russian gas and oil giant Gazprom, last month while it was undergoing repair in the workshops of Siemens Energy Canada. Kyiv urged the Canadian government not to return it to Germany, stating that such a decision would breach the integrity of sanctions against Russia. But Germany, which is facing severe gas shortages, is being threatened with a further squeeze on Russian gas by Moscow if the turbine isn’t returned, and pleaded with Canada to send it back. Its return will support “Europe’s ability to access reliable and affordable energy as they continue to transition away from Russian oil and gas,” Canada’s energy ministry said in a statement. In an apparent attempt at appeasement of Ukraine, Canada announced new sanctions against Russia’s energy sector. The sanctions “will apply to land and pipeline transport and the manufacturing of metals and of transport, computer, electronic and electrical equipment, as well as of machinery,” the statement said. Here’s a handy explainer from CBC about the wrangling over the turbine. And you can read more about Germany’s reliance on Russian energy here: It’s past midnight Sunday in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s what we’ve been following as the conflict in Ukraine reaches its 138th day: At least five people were killed Saturday, and seven others injured, by renewed Russian shelling in the eastern region of Donetsk, Ukraine officials said. A missile attack in Druzkivka, northern Donetsk, tore apart a supermarket and gouged a crater into the ground. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said his country’s “commitment to the people of Ukraine is resolute” while announcing more than $360m in additional aid. The United Nations said Ukraine’s armed forces bore a large, and perhaps equal, share of the blame for an assault at a nursing home in Luhansk, where dozens of elderly and disabled patients were trapped inside without water or electricity. At least 22 of the 71 patients survived, but the exact number killed remains unknown. Kira Rudik, a Ukrainian MP with the centrist Golos party, said rockets struck central Kharkiv, injuring and hospitalising four civilians, including a child. Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesperson for the Odesa regional military administration, said Russia forces were “purposefully” destroying crops in the Kherson region. He said fires occur in the fields every day from shelling, and added: “Russian troops do not allow locals to put out fires, destroying granaries and equipment.” The governor of the Luhansk region said Russian forces were creating “hell” in shelling the Donetsk region. Serhiy Haidai said Russian forces fired eight artillery shells, three mortar shells and launched nine rocket strikes overnight. Russia is moving forces across the country and assembling them near Ukraine for future offensive operations, according to the ministry of defence. The latest intelligence update said a large proportion of the new infantry units were “probably” deploying with MT-LB armoured vehicles taken from long-term storage. The first cohort of Ukrainian soldiers arrived in the UK to be trained in combat by British forces. The programme will train up to 10,000 Ukrainians over the coming months to give volunteer recruits with little to no military experience the skills to be effective in frontline combat. World Central Kitchen, the global, rapid response non-profit founded by celebrity chef José Andrés to provide meals to victims and first responders at the site of disasters, has posted to Twitter video of the aftermath of today’s Russian missile attack on Drujkivka, Donetsk. Here are some more images from Ukraine, sent to us over the news wires on Saturday. The New York Times on Saturday published an in-depth news analysis predicting the conflict in Ukraine could devolve into a long-lasting war of attrition, with Russian president Vladimir Putin “gambling that he can outlast a fickle, impatient West”. The outcome, the newspaper says, is “likely to be shaped by whether the US and its allies can maintain their military, political and financial commitments to holding off Russia”. It notes the US has committed $54bn (£45bn) in military and other aid to Ukraine, which is expected to last into next year, but states there is unlikely to be much appetite for pledging anywhere near as much again when stocks of weapons from the US and European allies begin to run low. Democratic senator for Delaware Chris Coons, a close ally of President Joe Biden, told the newspaper that the allies needed to be “determined” in continuing to support Ukraine: I worry about the fatigue factor of the public in a wide range of countries because of the economic costs and because there are other pressing concerns. Exactly how long this will go, exactly what the trajectory will be, we don’t know right now. But we know if we don’t continue to support Ukraine, the outcome for the US will be much worse. The Guardian is committed to occasionally sharing with readers other media outlets’ coverage of the conflict in Ukraine. You can read the New York Times analysis here. It’s Richard Luscombe in the US picking up the blog from my colleague Nadeem Badshah. I’ll be guiding you through the next few hours. Thanks for joining me. Officials in Ukraine say at least five people were killed in renewed Russian shelling Saturday of the country’s eastern Donetsk region, AFP reports. A missile attack in Druzhkivka, northern Donetsk, tore apart a supermarket and gouged a crater into the ground, the news agency said. At least five people were killed in the Donetsk region in the past 24 hours, and seven injured, Ukrainian officials said in a Saturday afternoon update. Oleksandr Vilkul, mayor of Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine, said Russia attacked the city with cluster munitions, killing at least one person and injuring two. Russia’s defence ministry said it inflicted heavy losses in the Mykolaiv and Dnepropetrovsk regions, in southern and central Ukraine respectively, and claimed strikes on Donetsk and the Kharkiv region. Russia is unlikely to withdraw from a swathe of land across Ukraine’s southern coast and will defeat Ukrainian forces in the whole of the eastern Donbas region, Russia’s ambassador to the UK has said. When asked how the conflict might end, Andrei Kelin said it was difficult to see Russian and Russian-backed forces withdrawing from the south of Ukraine, and that Ukraine’s soldiers would be pushed back from all of Donbas. “We are going to liberate all of the Donbas,” Kelin told Reuters. “Of course, it is difficult to predict the withdrawal of our forces from the southern part of Ukraine because we have already experience that after withdrawal, provocations start and all the people are being shot and all that.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has dismissed Kyiv’s ambassador to Germany on Saturday as well as several other top foreign envoys, the presidential website said. In a decree that gave no reason for the move, he announced the sacking of Ukraine’s ambassadors to Germany, India, the Czech Republic, Norway and Hungary, Reuters reports. It was not immediately clear whether the envoys would be handed new jobs. Kyiv’s relations with Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies and is also Europe’s biggest economy, have been a particularly sensitive matter. The two countries are at odds over a German-made turbine undergoing maintenance in Canada. Germany wants Ottawa to return the turbine to the Russian natural gas giant Gazprom to pump gas to Europe. Kyiv has urged Canada to keep the turbine, saying that shipping it to Russia would be a violation of sanctions imposed on Moscow. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said sanctions against Russia are working, and repeated calls for more deliveries of high-precision western weapons, Reuters reports. “Russians desperately try to lift those sanctions which proves that they do hurt them. Therefore, sanctions must be stepped up until Putin drops his aggressive plans,” Kuleba told a forum in Dubrovnik, Croatia by video link. Earlier, we reported on allegations from Ukrainian officials that Russian forces are “purposefully” destroying crops in the Kherson region. In a post on Facebook, local police forces said they have opened criminal proceedings after constant shelling and Russian forces not permitting the extinguishing of fires in occupied land. Police said large-scale fires are a daily occurrence, burning through hundreds of hectares of wheat, barley and other grain crops, in addition to forests. The post said: Due to constant shelling, it is extremely difficult to extinguish such fires in the de-occupied territories, and in the occupied lands the Russians deliberately do not allow extinguishing the occupation, the immigrants destroy grain warehouses, agricultural machinery and solar power plants. British forces have begun training Ukrainian soldiers in a new programme to help in their fight against Russia. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, visited the military camp in the north-west of England where up to 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers will arrive for specialist military training. It’s past 5pm in Ukraine – here are the latest updates: On Saturday the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the US’s “commitment to the people of Ukraine is resolute” while announcing more than $360m in additional aid. The United Nations has said Ukraine’s armed forces bear a large, and perhaps equal, share of the blame for an assault that took place at a nursing home in Luhansk, where dozens of elderly and disabled patients were trapped inside without water or electricity. At least 22 of the 71 patients survived the assault, but the exact number of people killed remains unknown.

Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesperson for the Odesa regional military administration, has said Russia forces are “purposefully” destroying crops in the Kherson region. He said fires occur in the fields every day from shelling, and added: “Russian troops do not allow locals to put out fires, destroying granaries and equipment.” The governor of the Luhansk region has said Russian forces are creating “hell” in shelling the Donetsk region. Serhiy Haidai said Russian forces fired eight artillery shells, three mortar shells and launched nine rocket strikes overnight. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has expressed concerns about China’s alignment with Russia, after meeting with China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, in Indonesia. Blinken said the US saw no signs “at this moment in time” that Russia was willing to engage in meaningful diplomacy. Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region was also shelled on Saturday, according to the region’s governor. Pavlo Kyrylenko said the cities of Druzhkivka, Slovyansk, Chasovoy Yar, Hirnyk and Svitlodar had been attacked. Russia is moving forces across the country and assembling them near Ukraine for future offensive operations, according to Britain’s Ministry of Defence. The latest intelligence update said a large proportion of the new infantry units were “probably” deploying with MT-LB armoured vehicles taken from long-term storage. The first cohort of Ukrainian soldiers have arrived in the UK to be trained in combat by British forces. The programme will train up to 10,000 Ukrainians over the coming months to give volunteer recruits with little to no military experience the skills to be effective in frontline combat. About 1,050 UK service personnel are being deployed to run the programme, which will take place at Ministry of Defence sites across the the UK. Images are coming through on the wires of an exhibition of Ukrainian army hardware and weapons left in the city of Lysychansk, after troops fled. Earlier this week, Vladimir Putin declared victory in the eastern Ukrainian region and told Russian troops to rest and “increase their combat capabilities”, a day after Ukrainian forces withdrew from their last remaining stronghold in the province. On Saturday, the governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, wrote on Telegram: “Luhansk region is not occupied – a small part of the region is held by the armed forces of Ukraine, despite the Russians’ declarations of victory.” An investigation by the Times has found 18 properties in England owned by the Russian state that it says could be seized and given to Ukraine. The Times said Ukraine was also considering legal action to take possession of the 18 properties, which could be worth up to £100m. Vadym Prystaiko, the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, said: We appreciate Britain and the EU said they would help us rebuild Ukraine but it’s Russia that needs to pay for that ... For us, this would be a straightforward way of doing it. On Saturday, following his departure from Indonesia, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the US’s “commitment to the people of Ukraine is resolute” while announcing more than $360mn in aid. Earlier, we reported on Blinken’s meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, during which they discussed Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, and Blinken raised concerns over Beijing’s alignment with Moscow. “I don’t believe China is acting in a way that is neutral,” Blinken said. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine and elsewhere over the newswires. The United Nations has said Ukraine’s armed forced bear a large, and perhaps equal, share of the blame for an assault that took place at a nursing home in Luhansk, where dozens of elderly and disabled patients were trapped inside without water or electricity, two weeks after Russia launched it’s invasion. According to AP, Ukrainian authorities placed the fault on Russian forces, accusing them of killing more than 50 civilians in an unprovoked attack. At least 22 of the 71 patients survived the assault, but the exact number of people killed remains unknown, according to the UN. However, the United Nations has now said Ukraine’s armed forces bear a large, and perhaps equal, share of the blame for what happened in the village of Stara Krasnyanka. The report by the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights did not conclude that either side committed war crimes, but said the battle at the nursing home was an example of concerns over the potential use of “human shields” to prevent military operations in certain areas. A Ukrainian MP, Kira Rudik with the centrist Golos party, said rockets have struck central Kharkiv, injuring and hospitalising 4 civilians, including a child. In case you missed it earlier, British forces have begun training Ukrainian soldiers in a new programme to help in their fight against Russia. Up to 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers will arrive in the UK for specialist military training lasting several weeks. The first cohort met the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, on Thursday, the Ministry of Defence confirmed. Wallace, widely expected to launch a campaign to replace Boris Johnson as leader of the Conservative party, described the programme as the next phase of Britain’s support to the Ukrainian army. “Using the world-class expertise of the British army, we will help Ukraine to rebuild its forces and scale up its resistance as they defend their country’s sovereignty and their right to choose their own future,” he said. Ukraine is losing up to 200 soldiers every day, meaning that training reinforcements away from the threat of Russian attacks is critical to the country’s war effort. Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesperson for the Odesa regional military administration, has said Russia forces are “purposefully” destroying crops in the Kherson region. Sharing photos from local police of fields on fire and scorched, Bratchuk said: Due to shelling with incendiary shells, large-scale fires occur every day in the fields, in protective strips and forests throughout the territory of the region. In addition, Russian troops do not allow locals to put out fires, destroying granaries and equipment. It’s past 1pm in Ukraine. Here’s a summary of the day so far: The governor of the Luhansk region has said Russian forces are creating “hell” in shelling the Donetsk region. Serhiy Haidai said Russian forces fired 8 artillery shells, 3 mortar shells and launched 9 rocket strikes overnight. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken expressed concerns about China’s alignment with Russia, after meeting with China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, in Indonesia. Blinken said the US saw no signs “at this moment in time” that Russia was willing to engage in meaningful diplomacy. Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region was also shelled on Saturday, according to the region’s governor. Pavlo Kyrylenko said the cities of Druzhkivka, Slovyansk, Chasovoy Yar, Hirnyk and Svitlodar had been attacked. Russia is moving forces across the country and assembling them near Ukraine for future offensive operations, according to Britain’s Ministry of Defence. The latest intelligence update said a large proportion of the new infantry units were “probably” deploying with MT-LB armoured vehicles taken from long-term storage.

About 1,050 UK service personnel are being deployed to run the programme, which will take place at Ministry of Defence sites across the the UK. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister has asked all residents in the Russian-occupied regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia to “evacuate by all possible means”. “Please leave – our army will begin retaking these areas. Our determination is rock solid. And it will be very difficult later to open humanitarian corridors when children are involved,” said Iryna Vereshchuk, according to Ukrainian media. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, left the G20 meeting of leading economies early on Friday after telling his counterparts that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was not responsible for a global hunger crisis and that sanctions designed to isolate Russia amounted to a declaration of war. Watch more here: Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine and elsewhere over the newswires. The governor of the Luhansk region has said Russian forces are creating “hell” in shelling the Donetsk region. In a Telegram post on Saturday, Serhiy Haidai said: It may seem that the invaders are conducting an offensive operation west of Lysychansk and that’s all. However, we are trying to contain the armed formations of the Russians along the entire frontline. They do not stop trying to break into the neighbouring region along the administrative border. They attack from several directions. Where it is inconvenient for them to go forward, they create real hell, shelling the territories on the horizon. Therefore, danger is coming everywhere – from Kreminnaya to Popasnaya. Haidai said Russian forces fired 8 artillery shells, 3 mortar shells and launched 9 rocket strikes overnight. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, were holding talks on the Indonesian island of Bali on Saturday, a day after they both attended a gathering of top diplomats from the G20 countries. Blinken discussed Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, and raised concerns over Beijing’s alignment with Moscow, AP reports. Speaking to reporters after talks with Wang, which lasted more than five hours, he said: We are concerned about the PRC’s alignment with Russia. I don’t believe China is acting in a way that is neutral. Blinken said they saw no signs “at this moment in time” that Russia was willing to engage in meaningful diplomacy, according to Reuters. The aggression is not only against Ukraine, he said but against the basic principles of the world order. “We will see in coming days if Russia got the message at G20.” Ukraine restores Danube River ports in emergency effort to get grain out Ukraine is restoring and expanding some of its long-decommissioned river ports on the Danube to facilitate the exportation of grain amid Russia’s Black Sea blockade. Before the war, Ukrainian river ports on the Danube were seldom used, with some of them in complete disrepair. However, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its control of exit routes to the Black Sea, Kyiv is resuscitating its old river harbours in order to avoid the sea blockade and accelerate the exportation of the country’s wheat. “Take the example of the Reni River port,’’ Alla Stoyanova, the head of the department of agricultural policy of the Odesa region, told the Guardian. The port was among the most important of the Danube region during the Soviet Union and a passageway to Romania. “It wasn’t used at all recently. So now we are working to expand it, alongside other river ports, to increase capacity. As we speak, over 160 ships are awaiting in the Black Sea to enter the Sulina canal, but they can’t because the capacity of that canal is only 5-6 ships a day.” Read more from my colleagues Lorenzo Tondo in Odesa and Pjotr Sauer: Russian shelling of the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih has killed two people and injured three, according to the governor of Dnipropetrovsk. In a Telegram post, Valentyn Reznichenko also said: A 43-year-old man is in the hospital. This is the father of the dead girl. How to tell him that his child is no longer there... Earlier we reported on Ukrainian soldiers arriving in UK for training. About 1,050 UK service personnel are running the programme, which will train up to 10,000 Ukrainians over the coming months. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, who visited the training this week, said: This ambitious new training programme is the next phase in the UK’s support to the armed forces of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression. Using the world-class expertise of the British army, we will help Ukraine to rebuild its forces and scale up its resistance as they defend their country’s sovereignty and their right to choose their own future. A woman’s portrait painted in the blue and yellow colours of the Ukrainian flag and also streaked with blood-red paint is among 300 pictures by Ukrainian children being displayed in a Kyiv bomb shelter. The exhibition – titled Children. War. Future – opened to journalists on Friday in a central Kyiv metro station that has been closed since the beginning of Russia’s invasion on 24 February, Agence France-Presse reports. Olena Sotnyk, an exhibition organiser as well as a Ukrainian politician and adviser to the prime minister, said: “It’s worth reminding adults – the whole world – that children see all this, experience it, feel it. And, unlike us, they can’t make decisions. “They expect adults and the world to act to stop the war.” The paintings by Ukrainian children from across the country depict horrors in places such as Mariupol – a city brutally besieged and bombed by Russian forces – and Bucha, one of the first towns where civilians were found killed en masse. Others are optimistic: a smiling soldier straps on a helmet, a woman wears a blue and yellow wreath of flowers with a dove surrounded by multicoloured flowers. But the captions are unambiguous: “No to war” and “I don’t want to die”. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine and elsewhere over the newswires. Russia launched shelling of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region on Saturday, according to the region’s governor. Pavlo Kyrylenko said that according to “preliminary information”, there had been a missile strike in the city of Druzhkivka. He said a hospital, the Palace of Culture, residential buildings and a playground were damaged. They were awaiting information about victims. In Slovyansk, a home was targeted, burying the owner under rubble. Kyrylenko said rescue workers are on site. Russian forces also fired at a railway station in Chasovoy Yar, the governor said, where several people were injured. And overnight, the city of Hirnyk came under fire, he said, cutting power lines, wounding two civilians and damaging residential buildings and infrastructure. Parts of Svitlodar were also under fire. “The only correct way out is evacuation!” Kyrylenko said in a post on Telegram. Germany says it hopes to convince Canada to deliver a turbine needed to maintain the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, with Russia waiting on the machine’s arrival before increasing supplies, Agence France-Presse reports. Germany is seeking to bolster waning energy supplies, but Ukraine has accused Berlin of giving in to Russian “blackmail” after Moscow blamed reduced supplies on the need for pipeline repairs, not market conditions amid the Ukraine war. The turbine is currently undergoing maintenance at a Canadian site owned by the German industrial giant Siemens. Russian energy behemoth Gazprom last month blamed the issue for a reduction in supplies to Germany via the controversial pipeline, with Berlin facing a serious energy crisis. Berlin says it has been in regular contact with Ottawa in recent weeks to ensure the turbine’s swift transfer back to Europe without Canada falling foul of Ukraine-related sanctions against Russia. Germany has been concerned by a wider pipeline maintenance session set to start on Monday and for about 10 days. A German government spokesperson, Steffen Hebestreit, said on Friday that Berlin had received “positive signals” from Canada. Russia is moving forces across the country and assembling them near Ukraine for future offensive operations, according to Britain’s Ministry of Defence. The latest intelligence update, published on Saturday, said a large proportion of the new infantry units were “probably” deploying with MT-LB armoured vehicles taken from long-term storage. The update said Russia has long considered them unsuitable for most infantry transport roles. Despite President Putin’s claim on 7 July 2022 that the Russian military has ‘not even started’ its efforts in Ukraine, many of its reinforcements are ad hoc groupings, deploying with obsolete or inappropriate equipment. This is Geneva Abdul in London. I’ll be taking you through updates over the next few hours. A Ukrainian regional official has warned of deteriorating living conditions in a city captured by Russian forces two weeks ago, saying Sievierodonetsk is without water, power or a working sewage system while the bodies of the dead decompose in hot apartment buildings. Governor Serhiy Haidai said on Friday that Russian forces were unleashing indiscriminate artillery barrages as they tried to secure their gains in eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk province. Moscow this week claimed full control of Luhansk, but the governor and other Ukrainian officials said their troops retained a small part of the province. “Fierce battles are going on in several villages on the region’s border,” Haidai told Associated Press. “The Russians are relying on tanks and artillery to advance, leaving scorched earth.” Occupied Sievierodonetsk, meanwhile, “is on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe”, the governor wrote on social media. “The Russians have completely destroyed all the critical infrastructure.” The Guardian’s weekly wrap is here and contains a selection of crucial points from the past week’s coverage, from the fighting in Donbas and the retaking of Snake Island to the $750bn “Marshall plan” to rebuild postwar Ukraine. The Ukrainian soldiers being trained in the UK have met UK defence secretary Ben Wallace, Press Association reports, at the start of their training, which is expected to last several weeks. Wallace said: “This ambitious new training programme is the next phase in the UK’s support to the Armed Forces of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression. Using the world-class expertise of the British Army we will help Ukraine to rebuild its forces and scale up its resistance as they defend their country’s sovereignty and their right to choose their own future.” The training will give volunteer recruits with little or no military experience the skills to be effective in frontline combat. Based on the UK’s basic soldier training, the course covers weapons handling, battlefield first aid, fieldcraft, patrol tactics and the law of armed conflict. The government has procured thousands of AK assault rifles for the programme, meaning Ukrainian soldiers can train on the weapons they will be using on the front line. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here is a summary of the latest developments. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister has asked all residents in the Russian-occupied territories of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions to “evacuate by all possible means”. “Please leave – our army will begin retaking these areas. Our determination is rock solid. And it will be very difficult later to open humanitarian corridors when children are involved,” said Iryna Vereshchuk, according to Ukrainian media. The first cohort of Ukrainian soldiers have arrived in the UK to be trained in combat by British forces. The programme will train up to 10,000 Ukrainians over the coming months to give volunteer recruits with little to no military experience the skills to be effective in frontline combat. Around 1,050 UK service personnel are being deployed to run the programme, which will take place at Ministry of Defence sites across the the UK. Luhansk’s governor said Russian forces were indiscriminately shelling populated areas on Friday, Reuters reports. “They are not stopped even by the fact that civilians remain there, dying in houses and yards,” Serhiy Gaidai said. Belgium will reopen its embassy in Kyiv and send a new ambassador, the Belgian prime minister confirmed. The embassy would open next week and ambassador Peter Van De Velde, whom Alexander De Croo met before he was sent to Ukraine, will represent Belgium. Ukraine’s military says it has destroyed two Russian command posts near Kherson, according to Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for the joint southern command of Ukraine’s armed forces. The Ukrainian foreign minister criticised Russia at the G20 summit in Bali, saying it prefers to follow its own rules instead of cooperating multilaterally with the international community. “I am strong supporter of multilateralism,” Dmytro Kuleba said. “But it lacks tools to protect itself from those who disrespect other nations, who prefer to play with common rules instead of playing by the rules. We have such a country at this table today – Russia.” The Ukrainian parliament adopted a set of new laws on Friday during its plenary session. The new laws include safety guarantees for journalists working in battle areas, improved social protection for rescuers, and postponed transitioning to keep records of the gas volumes in units of energy. The US is sending four more Himars, or high mobility artillery rocket systems, to Ukraine, a US senior defence official said at a press briefing on Friday. The four additional Himars will bring the total number given to Ukraine to 12. According to the official, the first eight were especially useful as the fighting in Donbas against Russian forces evolved into an artillery fight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/sep/02/uk-funding-to-tackle-climate-emergency-needs-to-more-than-double","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-02T10:55:32Z","webTitle":"Chancellor urged to double funding to tackle climate crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/02/uk-funding-to-tackle-climate-emergency-needs-to-more-than-double","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/sep/02/uk-funding-to-tackle-climate-emergency-needs-to-more-than-double","fields":{"headline":"Chancellor urged to double funding to tackle climate crisis","bodyText":"Britain’s biggest environmental groups have warned the government that funding to tackle the climate emergency must be more than double next year to avoid an even greater cost from catastrophic ecological breakdown in the future. Writing to the chancellor, Sajid Javid, as he prepares to announce on Wednesday his spending priorities for the year ahead, more than a dozen leading environment charities, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth as well as other leading organisations such as Oxfam and Christian Aid, said urgent action was required to raise spending. Spelling out their demands in a costed roadmap for meeting the climate emergency, the groups said that government spending needed to increase from roughly £17bn a year at present to at least £42bn over the next three years. Further increases would be required in the future should the government wish to meet its promise of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Failure to deliver the bold rise in expenditure, equivalent to about 2% of economic output each year and around 5% of total state spending, would mean passing on an unsustainable economy with a “planet-sized debt” caused by a climate breakdown, the groups said. Although broadly welcoming the 2050 target, promised by Theresa May among the final acts of her premiership, the charities said the date needed to be brought forward by several years and that policy and funding arrangements were not yet in place. In the letter to Javid, the organisations urged the chancellor to demonstrate that he understood the gravity of the challenge by holding a climate and nature emergency budget to unleash a clean industrial revolution in Britain. Also signed by charities including the Woodland Trust, WWF and Islamic Relief, the letter said higher state investment would encourage more private spending to bring about a low-carbon economy, telling Javid: “Your department holds the key to ending the UK’s contribution to climate change and reversing nature’s retreat, while also setting off a positive economic transformation.” Boris Johnson had said there would be greater funding for big infrastructure projects but without giving specific details for low-carbon schemes. Polling carried out for the charities by Opinium found a majority of people want ministers to spend more on the climate emergency and nature more broadly. Among the priorities put forward by the groups are an £11.6bn expansion in transport spending, including a UK-wide car scrappage scheme to remove heavily-polluting vehicles from the roads. As much as £2.6bn per year should be spent on rewilding projects and other land management schemes, billions should be ploughed into buildings and industry to boost environmental sustainability, while more funding should be given to help communities disrupted by the transition to a low-carbon economy. John Sauven, an economist and executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “No one in government is still trying to argue that this is not an emergency, and yet no one in government is acting as though it is. “We are still constantly pumping carbon into the atmosphere, and trying to ignore the problem will leave our children with a damaged world and a planet-sized debt. There’s a strong economic case and an overwhelming moral imperative for the chancellor to act.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/apr/17/townsvilles-road-to-paris-moment-the-slow-greening-of-an-adani-stronghold","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-16T20:00:16Z","webTitle":"Townsville’s ‘road to Paris’ moment: the slow greening of an Adani stronghold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/17/townsvilles-road-to-paris-moment-the-slow-greening-of-an-adani-stronghold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/apr/17/townsvilles-road-to-paris-moment-the-slow-greening-of-an-adani-stronghold","fields":{"headline":"Townsville’s ‘road to Paris’ moment: the slow greening of an Adani stronghold","bodyText":"“Adani was about the here and now for the community,” says Townsville’s mayor, Jenny Hill, reflecting on a decade spent championing the thermal coal project as a way to reduce the city’s high unemployment rate. “There were no jobs. There was no interest in manufacturing. It was important to give the community hope for the future.” Townsville’s place at the forefront of the coal wars have made Hill, who is a member of the ALP, a prominent figure in the party’s schism over coal and climate. In 2019 she told a forum run by Labor’s Chifley Research Centre that the city’s mantra was “we stick to our guns: we support mining”. It is remarkable, then, that Hill now says clean energy – and not thermal coal – will be at the forefront of Townsville’s future economy. “If you’re smart in politics you’ve got to deal with the short term, but you’ve got to deal with the long term as well,” Hill tells Guardian Australia. “The market will eventually decide what happens with thermal coal and where it ends up. The Japanese have put it out there on public record they are going to cut their thermal coal imports. “Economies [like South Korea and Japan] want clean energy and that means green hydrogen. We’re in a position to be able to deliver.” Some locals in Townsville described the subtle but significant shift in language from community and business leaders as a “road to Paris conversion” – a pivot brought about by rapidly changing international sentiment and declining prospects for coal. Hill doesn’t directly acknowledge a suggestion that the ground has shifted from a point a few years ago when she described Adani to the writer Anna Krien as “the only next big thing”. But she now speaks with zeal about the sorts of transition opportunities that might be created in a place where the port could link Queensland’s rare earth mineral deposits with the world; and where refining and manufacturing is already being fuelled by the city’s 320 days of annual sunlight. Townsville is developing an eco-industrial precinct with plans for a solar microgrid to power battery manufacturing, a nickel refinery and other industries. This week the port of Townsville signed a memorandum of understanding with energy company Origin to export green hydrogen, which could be produced locally with non-potable water and solar power. “The scientist in me sees it as a pilot study,” Hill said. “I will always support mining, but it doesn’t mean we can’t take advantage of these new technologies and bring manufacturing back into this country. “This is about reimagining the economy for my community and building it. If it works here, it can help ensure we get growth.” The future is sunny Last month Solar Citizens, a lobby group for solar owners and renewables supporters, released a report detailing how Townsville could become a renewable energy “powerhouse”, creating 11,000 jobs – equivalent to 10% of the city’s total workforce. Proposed manufacturing and industry projects powered by renewables could be worth $154bn over their lifetime, the report found. The city already has a company spearheading the transition: the Korea Zinc-owned refiner SunMetals, one of Queensland’s biggest energy consumers, and the first power-intensive facility in Australia to build its own solar farm. The Townsville council and its regional business lobby, Townsville Enterprise, are heavily promoting plans to build an “eco-industrial precinct” at Lansdown, which would run on a renewable micro-grid and could include a battery manufacturing plant, refineries and other green industry businesses. In Queensland politics, “transition” has been a dirty word. Pro-coal politicians like LNP senator Matt Canavan have said transition equates to job destruction. Rightwing media commentators have portrayed comments that miners need to “re-skill” as a kind of ideological warfare, rather than part of a discussion about how communities respond to a real global shift away from fossil fuels. “It’s the right of the workers in the community not to be destroyed in the process of the transition,” Tim Buckley, the director of energy finance studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, says. “And now the opportunities [from transition] are starting to become tangible and real.” Sean Cochrane, who runs renewable business SuperGreen Solutions in Townsville, says the conversation had clearly shifted in the city now people could see genuine opportunity from the energy transition. “A year ago it was all we need coal jobs, we need coal jobs,” Cochrane says. “There was never another argument, another source of jobs. I don’t think Townsville is the backwater that sometimes people in the south think it is. Townsville has come of age. People are looking for intelligent solutions.” Joseph O’Brien, the managing director of a Townsville company proposing to build Copperstring 2.0 – a project that would connect the North West Minerals Province to the national energy grid – says there are significant opportunities for the city. “I believe the real message here is that it’s not about what Townsville shouldn’t do, but what Townsville does as a global leader, and that’s advanced industrial manufacturing and minerals processing,” O’Brien said. “This pedigree in industrial manufacturing can be an enormous job creator and it’s also an enormous creator of expertise that will be very valuable for the region and for Australia too. “Townsville is an entrepreneurial and pragmatic place, it doesn’t have the luxury of choosing where it wants to get its jobs from. Regional centres need to play to their strengths and respond to global opportunities and for Townsville the global opportunities make for a very bright future.” ‘You don’t want your city to die’ After Townsville flooded in early 2019, residents in the low-lying suburb of Hermit Park brought out their dead appliances and mud-logged possessions and piled them up at the roadside. Guardian Australia asked a handful of locals there about climate change. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, had just called the flooding “unprecedented”. Experts overwhelmingly believe the climate is fuelling more extreme weather events. “If anyone mentions [climate change] I’ll punch ’em,” a local, Mark Parison, said immediately after the floods. “These people crying about climate change, they’ve got to look at how they live themselves. They’re still driving around in cars, they’re still wearing nice clothes. They’re using mobile phones. So give that up, I’ll start listening to you. “City people are stalling us. We need the economy here to be boosted.” So, for several years, has gone much of the debate in Townsville about coal and climate change. Kitchen table concerns come first. Even if your kitchen table is literally floating away. Elements of that fraught debate remain a reality in north Queensland, even as the opportunities of a green energy future move from concept towards reality. Few are ready to completely eschew the coal industry or its prospects to provide jobs for locals. “Whilst an eye must certainly be kept on the future, we cannot stop investing and supporting the existing industries that have been the backbone of our nation’s economy for generations,” says Wade Chiesa, the regional development and investment director of Townsville Enterprise. Chiesa highlights efforts to create new industries, but says north Queensland’s strengths remain “the natural resources sitting in our backyard and our capacity to generate energy”. “Off the back of 12 months of Covid-19 support measures from state and federal governments, the royalties generated by our mining and resources industry are more important than ever as we claw back from the largest debt we have ever experienced. “As of early this year, Bravus (Adani) had signed $2.2bn in contracts to build the Carmichael mine and rail project and in under two years since the project was greenlighted by the state government the company has employed more than 2,000 people. “Now is the time we need sustained jobs to support families, not a time to erase them.” Hill says the closure of Clive Palmer’s Queensland Nickel refinery was “a massive shock” to the northern port city, which was Australia’s first “solar city” back in 2007. “Adani [became] the face of everything because the community desperately needed jobs,” she says. “You don’t want your city to die. We had 13% unemployment. We have long-term aspirations but there’s a short-term need. “When you go doorknocking you see people who are barely making ends meet and are desperate for a job that is barely a living wage. Many tourism jobs are low-paying jobs, you can’t go into a bank and get a home loan with some of those jobs. When you’re in the mining sector you can.” Now, Hill says advanced manufacturing powered by renewables offers another prospect for well-paid work – and that the city will embrace its opportunity. “The key for me and the council is to show the community that we can get this right in Townsville. We can use renewables to power industry at a far cheaper rate than pulling power off the grid. “We’re hopeful for long-term jobs for our community.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2020/dec/15/australias-path-to-net-zero-emissions-is-massively-behind-schedule","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-14T16:30:41Z","webTitle":"Australia's path to net zero emissions is massively behind schedule | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/dec/15/australias-path-to-net-zero-emissions-is-massively-behind-schedule","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2020/dec/15/australias-path-to-net-zero-emissions-is-massively-behind-schedule","fields":{"headline":"Australia's path to net zero emissions is massively behind schedule","bodyText":"Far from being something to boast about, the latest projections for Australia’s greenhouse emissions reveal just how pathetic both our performance and our ambition are. As the saying goes, when the tide goes out you discover who is swimming naked. For the past four years the tide has been in for the government on the issue of climate change. Bathing in the denialist waters of the Trump presidency, the Morrison government was able to congratulate itself for not actually achieving anything with some impunity on the international stage. Prime minister Scott Morrison had been saying that Australia will meet its Paris commitment to reduce our emissions by 26% below 2005 levels “in a canter” despite the projections in 2019 suggesting our emissions by 2030 would only be 16% below. Now with the latest projections the spin continues – the government has declared the “updated projections confirm Australia is on track to meet and beat its 2030 Paris target”. They do show a reduction in our projected emissions, but “meet and beat”? Nope. We are now on track to cut our emissions by 22.3% from 2005 levels, which is still short of the 26% target (let alone the 28% upper target). So how did things “improve” in one year? Was it, as energy minister Angus Taylor suggests, “thanks to strong and practical action to reduce emissions by the Morrison government”? No. Mostly it was due to the pandemic and the subsequent weaker economy expected for the next decade: Graph not appearing? View here The latest projections also show what emissions would be were there a “faster return to pre-Covid-19 levels of activity in Australia and globally than assumed in the baseline”. In effect this “strong recovery” estimate is what our emissions would be were the economy to carry on from now as if there had been no pandemic. In such a case our emissions by 2030 would be just 19.6% below 2005 levels – barely much of an improvement, and still well below the 26% target. So bad is our performance that the last five years of this decade are projected to see a mere 0.4% annual fall and a “strong recovery” scenario would see emissions fall by an average of 0.1%: Graph not appearing? View here But of course this is all a fib, because our government includes “land use” in its targets, which makes our 26% target truly pathetic: Graph not appearing? View here If we exclude land use, our cuts by 2030 are projected to be a mere 7.9% below 2005 levels. The reason the Howard and Abbott governments fought to include land use in our Kyoto and Paris targets is because in those years we did an exceptional amount of land clearing: Graph not appearing? View here That makes “reducing” emissions much easier, because all we had to do was clear less forest rather than actually do something active such a shift to renewables or reduce transport emissions: Graph not appearing? View here So important is the inclusion of land use that since 2005 our actual emissions have in truth increased by 1.2%, but when we include land use they have “fallen” by 16.5%: Graph not appearing? View here So absurd is our inclusion of land use, that if it is excluded, the government’s target of a 26% cut instead is a mere 13% and should there be a “strong recovery” the government’s own projections show that the decrease is just 6% from 2005: Graph not appearing? View here As it is, for the next decade the big cuts are projected to come from electricity – emissions in all others sectors (except for a small fall in industrial processes emissions) will increase between now and 2030. The reduction in electricity emissions is mostly from less use of coal and gas and more wind and solar power generation: Graph not appearing? View here As Adam Morton noted on the weekend, “the idea the Morrison government deserves credit for this might politely be described as a stretch”. But needless to say even with this dodgy inclusion of land use and the impact of the pandemic, our cuts are nowhere near the 45%-65% cuts that are recommended to give us the best chance of keeping temperature increase below 1.5C from pre-industrial levels. They are also nowhere near enough to get us to net zero emissions by 2050. The government refuses to set a target when it will achieve zero net emissions; only that it wants to “reach net zero emissions as quickly as possible”. Well, that isn’t any time soon if we keep on our current trajectory. These latest figures project a mere 6.8% cut over the next decade. If we extrapolate that out it would see Australia still emitting 442Mt of CO2 in 2050: Graph not appearing? View here The Labor party suggests the current trend would not see us achieve zero emission for 146 years. I think they are understating. Given the big drop in 2020 due to the pandemic, excluding that year is appropriate for predicting the future. The 2021-2030 trend would have us taking another 277 years: Graph not appearing? View here With the coming Biden presidency pushing for real action on reducing emissions, the Morrison government’s climate change policy nakedness is revealed for all to see. Quickly it is finding itself friendless on the international stage as its long obstruction and pushing of fossil fuels is no longer tolerated. The pandemic and economic slowdown have allowed the government to claim that it has reduced emissions. But the reality is our current path to net zero emissions is massively behind schedule and will now require much sharper cuts in years to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2020/feb/19/mike-and-annie-cannon-brookes-pledge-12m-to-supply-solar-systems-for-disaster-relief","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-19T07:46:56Z","webTitle":"Mike and Annie Cannon-Brookes pledge $12m to supply solar systems for disaster relief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/19/mike-and-annie-cannon-brookes-pledge-12m-to-supply-solar-systems-for-disaster-relief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2020/feb/19/mike-and-annie-cannon-brookes-pledge-12m-to-supply-solar-systems-for-disaster-relief","fields":{"headline":"Mike and Annie Cannon-Brookes pledge $12m to supply solar systems for disaster relief","bodyText":"Software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie have promised up to $12m to install solar and battery systems in communities disconnected from the electricity grid by bushfire or flood. The couple say they will provide prefabricated solar panel and battery systems through a new venture, known as Resilient Energy Collective, that will power up to 100 sites disconnected from the grid in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. Some are relying on diesel generators, others are without power. Cannon-Brookes, the co-founder of Atlassian and a vocal supporter of stronger action to combat the climate crisis, said the goal was to find and fund a response that could be rolled out within days and, in some cases, become a long-term solution for electricity generation. He said Australia needed to “learn the lessons of this summer and invest in energy systems that help the planet, not hurt it”. Solar and batteries made sense because they were resilient, fast, flexible and reduced the cost of electricity, he said. “In the future, we see a world in which many remote communities operate on solar power, off the grid,” he said. “To get this done, we need the cooperation of the energy providers. We want to work with them to identify the areas most in need.” Cannon-Brookes has previously joined Andrew Forrest as an investor in Sun Cable, an ambitious project to power Singapore using solar power from the Northern Territory outback, and strongly backed a bill by independent MP Zali Steggall that would set a national budget for greenhouse gas emissions and introduce five-yearly climate risk assessments. The Resilient Energy Collective project promises pre-built solar systems that can be “folded up, packed onto a truck for transport, unfolded and connected to your home or business in less than a day”. Systems are already operating in two locations. In one, near Cobargo in south-east NSW, solar panels and batteries were installed in two days to replace diesel generators powering radio towers used by police, the Rural Fire Service, NSW National Parks and the Eurobodalla shire council. A second system has been installed in east Gippsland to power the Goongerah community hall, which is being used by fire-affected locals for relief services, internet connection and refrigeration. The prototype systems, using equipment from solar innovation company 5B and battery provider Tesla, have been made available to energy providers, which then identify the sites most in need. Applications can be made online. Cannon-Brookes said in the longer term the systems may be leased to energy providers to use during disaster relief."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jul/02/uk-heatwave-helps-solar-power-to-record-weekly-highs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-02T10:45:28Z","webTitle":"UK heatwave helps solar power to record weekly highs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/02/uk-heatwave-helps-solar-power-to-record-weekly-highs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jul/02/uk-heatwave-helps-solar-power-to-record-weekly-highs","fields":{"headline":"UK heatwave helps solar power to record weekly highs","bodyText":"Britain’s heatwave has helped break several solar power-generation records, and over the weekend the renewable energy source briefly eclipsed gas power stations as the UK’s top source of electricity. While new solar installations have virtually flatlined over the past year, a run of largely cloudless days has seen a series of highs for power generation by the sector. Solar broke the record for weekly output between 21 and 28 June, producing 533 gigawatt hours of power. During that period, solar generated more than 75GWh on five of the seven days, another record. In a first, solar output also hit more than 8GW for eight consecutive days. The records are largely symbolic – gas and nuclear generated much more power in recent days – but the milestones shows how far the technology has come. A decade ago, solar contributed almost nothing to UK electricity supplies. Duncan Burt, director of system operations at National Grid, said: “During the past 12 months alone, we have seen renewable generation records broken and we expect this trend to continue, as technology advances and we find new ways to accommodate and manage more wind and solar power on our network.” For about an hour on Saturday afternoon, solar panels across the country’s rooftops and fields were the number one source of electricity, with a share of more than 27%. So far, solar has only come top at weekends, when demand is lower. The record for peak solar generation was 9.42GW, set on 14 May this year. At the end of May, there was a total of 12.8GW of solar capacity in the UK, up just 1.6% on May 2017. The rate at which solar records are set is likely to slow, as growth has petered out due to subsidy cuts. Incentives for householders to put panels on their roofs are due to expire next year, with no sign of a replacement scheme. At the bigger scale, some developers believe they can build without subsidies, by going large. Hive Energy told an industry audience last week that it believes technological improvements mean its planned Kent solar farm will have 14% more capacity than originally conceived. The Cleve Hill scheme could have a capacity of as much 400MW, the company said, compared to the UK’s current largest solar farm, a 72.2MW one in Wales. Dr Alastair Buckley, a solar expert at the University of Sheffield, said: “This marks the start of subsidy-free solar being economically viable, and I genuinely believe we’ll see bigger changes to the electricity sector in the next 10 years than we’ve seen in the past 10.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/nov/05/victoria-plans-300mw-tesla-battery-to-help-stabilise-grid-as-renewables-increase","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-05T02:38:24Z","webTitle":"Victoria plans 300MW Tesla battery to help stabilise grid as renewables increase","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/05/victoria-plans-300mw-tesla-battery-to-help-stabilise-grid-as-renewables-increase","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/nov/05/victoria-plans-300mw-tesla-battery-to-help-stabilise-grid-as-renewables-increase","fields":{"headline":"Victoria plans 300MW Tesla battery to help stabilise grid as renewables increase","bodyText":"One of the largest lithium-ion batteries in the world is planned for Victoria after the renewable energy company Neoen won a contract to build it near the regional city of Geelong. If constructed as promised, the battery will have a power capacity of 300 megawatts and a storage capacity of 450 megawatt-hours, making it more than twice the size of the battery at Hornsdale, South Australia, which was the biggest in the world when it began operating in 2017. Like the Hornsdale facility, the Geelong battery will be built using Tesla equipment. The Victorian energy and climate change minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said it would be installed near Moorabool Terminal Station and would be ready for the 2021-22 summer. It is expected to store enough energy to run about 500,000 homes for half an hour. It has been scaled back since it was first flagged in April when it was expected to be 600MW and cost $300m. While among the largest batteries in the world, it is smaller than batteries planned in California and New York. D’Ambrosio said it would improve the reliability of the power grid as ageing coal-fired power stations became less reliable and the state increased its reliance on wind and solar power. The Andrews government aims to source 40% of the state’s electricity from renewable energy by 2025, and 50% by 2030. “By securing one of the biggest batteries in the world Victoria is taking a decisive step away from coal-fired power and embracing new technologies that will unlock more renewable energy than ever before,” she said. She said consumers would pay for the use of the battery through their power bills, but suggested it would lead to a reduction in wholesale energy prices so that Victorians were charged less for electricity. Independent analysis found that Victorians would receive $2 in benefits for every $1 invested in the battery, she said. Energy consultancy Aurecon found the Hornsdale Power Reserve saved consumers $116m in 2019. Neoen won the right to build the Victorian battery through a tender run by the Australian Energy Market Operator. Its contract, which runs until 2032, requires the battery to fill the breach if there is an unexpected network outage. It will also provide network services needed to support variable renewable energy, such as fast frequency control. The tender process was initiated by the Victorian government. The Victorian Greens welcomed the announcement, saying it was part of what it had proposed under its “green new deal” plan. But the acting leader, Ellen Sandell, said the battery should have been publicly owned and the state needed to plan to move away from coal. “Now the government needs to go one step further and actually admit we need to get off coal in Victoria,” Sandell said. The conservation group Environment Victoria said it was a “game-changer for Victoria’s transition from old coal-burning power stations to clean energy”. “This big battery gets us halfway to the storage target we need to prepare for the closure of Yallourn [coal] power station,” the group’s chief executive, Jonathan La Nauze, said. The state opposition said it was “committed to supporting a considered clean energy transition” but argued the government had not made the case for the project to be at Geelong. The Coalition energy spokesman, Ryan Smith, said it had called in June for a battery to be based further west, at Mortlake near the state’s main renewable energy production zone. “If it is located at Labor’s proposed site, too much energy from renewables projects will be lost in the transmission to the battery storage,” Smith said. There are expected to be 80 jobs during construction of the battery, but just six full-time permanent positions once it is built. The introduction of another large battery into the grid will further chip away at the extent to which it relies on gas-fired power for “dispatchable” generation that can be called on to support variable renewable energy. Aemo has estimated the national grid is likely to need between six and 19 gigawatts of dispatchable power by 2040 as the system is increasingly dominated by solar and wind. It found renewable energy may at times provide nearly 90% of electricity by 2035, the amount of gas-fired power would fall as pumped hydro and batteries came online and there was no place for new coal-fired generation. Despite this, the Morrison government says new gas-fired power is essential for the stability of the grid as ageing coal plants close. The market operator’s chief executive, Audrey Zibelman, said Neoen’s proposal was “a significantly more cost competitive and attractive market response than other recent major battery developments in Australia”. A portion of the battery’s capacity will be reserved to increase electricity supply over an interconnector cable between Victoria and New South Wales."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
